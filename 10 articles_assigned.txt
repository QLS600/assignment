See Table 1 Talairach coordinates (center of gravity) and Z scores of activated areas during 0-BACK, 1-BACK and 2-BACK conditions and Table 2 Talairach coordinates (center of gravity) in areas modulating during 0-BACK, 1-BACK and 2-BACK conditions, and ANOVA results.

See Tables 1-5 for summary statistics. Also, Table 6 Brain activation (mean percent of voxels with activity z-scores>3) in regions of interest during the 1-back working memory condition relative to the control condition, across the four study groups; Table 7 Brain activation in regions of interest during the 2-back working memory condition relative to the control condition, across the four study groups; Table 8 Increase in brain activation (using the activation measure: mean percent of voxels with activity z-scores>3) during more difficult 2-back task compared to 1-back task, across the four study groups. Data not shown: "The level of activation (when measured as the mean activity z-score across all voxels within each brain region) during the 1-back task was also comparable across all study groups (data not shown)." Data not presented: "All Pearson Correlation Coefficients had two-tailed p-values > 0.05 (data not presented)."
