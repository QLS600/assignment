TI  - N-back Working Memory Task: Meta-analysis of Normative fMRI Studies With Children.
PG  - 2010-2022
LID - 10.1111/cdev.13080 [doi]
AB  - The n-back task is likely the most popular measure of working memory for functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. Despite accumulating neuroimaging studies 
      with the n-back task and children, its neural representation is still unclear. fMRI 
      studies that used the n-back were compiled, and data from children up to 15 years 
      (n = 260) were analyzed using activation likelihood estimation. Results show 
      concordance in frontoparietal regions recognized for their role in working memory as 
      well as regions not typically highlighted as part of the working memory network, 
      such as the insula. Findings are discussed in terms of developmental methodology and 
      potential contribution to developmental theories of cognition.

TI  - Meta-analyses of the n-back working memory task: fMRI evidence of age-related 
      changes in prefrontal cortex involvement across the adult lifespan.
PG  - 16-31

AB  - Working memory, a fundamental cognitive function that is highly dependent on the 
      integrity of the prefrontal cortex, is known to show age-related decline across the 
      typical healthy adult lifespan. Moreover, we know from work in neurophysiology that 
      the prefrontal cortex is disproportionately susceptibly to the pathological effects 
      of aging. The n-back task is arguably the most ubiquitous cognitive task for 
      investigating working memory performance. Many functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) studies examine brain regions engaged during performance of the n-back task 
      in adults. The current meta-analyses are the first to examine concordance and 
      age-related changes across the healthy adult lifespan in brain areas engaged when 
      performing the n-back task. We compile data from eligible fMRI articles that report 
      stereotaxic coordinates of brain activity from healthy adults in three age-groups: 
      young (23.57 ± 5.63 years), middle-aged (38.13 ± 5.63 years) and older (66.86 ± 5.70 
      years) adults. Findings show that the three groups share concordance in the 
      engagement of parietal and cingulate cortices, which have been consistently 
      identified as core areas involved in working memory; as well as the insula, 
      claustrum, and cerebellum, which have not been highlighted as areas involved in 
      working memory. Critically, prefrontal cortex engagement is concordant for young, to 
      a lesser degree for middle-aged adults, and absent in older adults, suggesting a 
      gradual linear decline in concordance of prefrontal cortex engagement. Our results 
      provide important new knowledge for improving methodology and theories of cognition 
      across the lifespan.

TI  - Altered Brain Activity in Unipolar Depression Revisited: Meta-analyses of 
      Neuroimaging Studies.
PG  - 47-55
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2016.2783 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: During the past 20 years, numerous neuroimaging experiments have 
      investigated aberrant brain activation during cognitive and emotional processing in 
      patients with unipolar depression (UD). The results of those investigations, 
      however, vary considerably; moreover, previous meta-analyses also yielded 
      inconsistent findings. OBJECTIVE: To readdress aberrant brain activation in UD as 
      evidenced by neuroimaging experiments on cognitive and/or emotional processing. DATA 
      SOURCES: Neuroimaging experiments published from January 1, 1997, to October 1, 
      2015, were identified by a literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, and Google 
      Scholar using different combinations of the terms fMRI (functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging), PET (positron emission tomography), neural, major depression, 
      depression, major depressive disorder, unipolar depression, dysthymia, emotion, 
      emotional, affective, cognitive, task, memory, working memory, inhibition, control, 
      n-back, and Stroop. STUDY SELECTION: Neuroimaging experiments (using fMRI or PET) 
      reporting whole-brain results of group comparisons between adults with UD and 
      healthy control individuals as coordinates in a standard anatomic reference space 
      and using an emotional or/and cognitive challenging task were selected. DATA 
      EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Coordinates reported to show significant activation 
      differences between UD and healthy controls during emotional or cognitive processing 
      were extracted. By using the revised activation likelihood estimation algorithm, 
      different meta-analyses were calculated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Meta-analyses 
      tested for brain regions consistently found to show aberrant brain activation in UD 
      compared with controls. Analyses were calculated across all emotional processing 
      experiments, all cognitive processing experiments, positive emotion processing, 
      negative emotion processing, experiments using emotional face stimuli, experiments 
      with a sex discrimination task, and memory processing. All meta-analyses were 
      calculated across experiments independent of reporting an increase or decrease of 
      activity in major depressive disorder. For meta-analyses with a minimum of 17 
      experiments available, separate analyses were performed for increases and decreases. 
      RESULTS: In total, 57 studies with 99 individual neuroimaging experiments comprising 
      in total 1058 patients were included; 34 of them tested cognitive and 65 emotional 
      processing. Overall analyses across cognitive processing experiments (P > .29) and 
      across emotional processing experiments (P > .47) revealed no significant results. 
      Similarly, no convergence was found in analyses investigating positive (all 
      P > .15), negative (all P > .76), or memory (all P > .48) processes. Analyses that 
      restricted inclusion of confounds (eg, medication, comorbidity, age) did not change 
      the results. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Inconsistencies exist across individual 
      experiments investigating aberrant brain activity in UD and replication problems 
      across previous neuroimaging meta-analyses. For individual experiments, these 
      inconsistencies may relate to use of uncorrected inference procedures, differences 
      in experimental design and contrasts, or heterogeneous clinical populations; 
      meta-analytically, differences may be attributable to varying inclusion and 
      exclusion criteria or rather liberal statistical inference approaches.

TI  - Parental Education and Left Lateral Orbitofrontal Cortical Activity during N-Back 
      Task: An fMRI Study of American Adolescents.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci11030401 [doi]
LID - 401
AB  - Introduction. The Orbitofrontal Cortex (OFC) is a cortical structure that has 
      implications in cognition, memory, reward anticipation, outcome evaluation, decision 
      making, and learning. As such, OFC activity correlates with these cognitive brain 
      abilities. Despite research suggesting race and socioeconomic status (SES) 
      indicators such as parental education may be associated with OFC activity, limited 
      knowledge exists on multiplicative effects of race and parental education on OFC 
      activity and associated cognitive ability. Purpose. Using functional brain imaging 
      data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, we tested the 
      multiplicative effects of race and parental education on left lateral OFC activity 
      during an N-Back task. In our study, we used a sociological rather than biological 
      theory that conceptualizes race and SES as proxies of access to the opportunity 
      structure and exposure to social adversities rather than innate and non-modifiable 
      brain differences. We explored racial variation in the effect of parental 
      educational attainment, a primary indicator of SES, on left lateral OFC activity 
      during an N-Back task between Black and White 9-10 years old adolescents. Methods. 
      The ABCD study is a national, landmark, multi-center brain imaging investigation of 
      American adolescents. The total sample was 4290 9-10 years old Black or White 
      adolescents. The independent variables were SES indicators, namely family income, 
      parental education, and neighborhood income. The primary outcome was the average 
      beta weight for N-Back (2 back versus 0 back contrast) in ASEG ROI left OFC 
      activity, measured by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) during an N-Back 
      task. Ethnicity, age, sex, subjective SES, and family structure were the study 
      covariates. For data analysis, we used linear regression models. Results. In White 
      but not Black adolescents, parental education was associated with higher left 
      lateral OFC activity during the N-Back task. In the pooled sample, we found a 
      significant interaction between race and parental education on the outcome, 
      suggesting that high parental education is associated with a larger increase in left 
      OFC activity of White than Black adolescents. Conclusions. For American adolescents, 
      race and SES jointly influence left lateral OFC activity correlated with cognition, 
      memory, decision making, and learning. Given the central role of left lateral OFC 
      activity in learning and memory, our finding calls for additional research on 
      contextual factors that reduce the gain of SES for Black adolescents. Cognitive 
      inequalities are not merely due to the additive effects of race and SES but also its 
      multiplicative effects.

LID - 10.1111/jnp.12076 [doi]
AB  - The goal of this study was to propose a new functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) paradigm using a language-free adaptation of a 2-back working memory task to 
      avoid cultural and educational bias. We additionally provide an index of the 
      validity of the proposed paradigm and test whether the experimental task 
      discriminates the behavioural performances of healthy participants from those of 
      individuals with working memory deficits. Ten healthy participants and nine patients 
      presenting working memory (WM) deficits due to acquired brain injury (ABI) performed 
      the developed task. To inspect whether the paradigm activates brain areas typically 
      involved in visual working memory (VWM), brain activation of the healthy 
      participants was assessed with fMRIs. To examine the task's capacity to discriminate 
      behavioural data, performances of the healthy participants in the task were compared 
      with those of ABI patients. Data were analysed with GLM-based random effects 
      procedures and t-tests. We found an increase of the BOLD signal in the specialized 
      areas of VWM. Concerning behavioural performances, healthy participants showed the 
      predicted pattern of more hits, less omissions and a tendency for fewer false 
      alarms, more self-corrected responses, and faster reaction times, when compared with 
      subjects presenting WM impairments. The results suggest that this task activates 
      brain areas involved in VWM and discriminates behavioural performances of clinical 
      and non-clinical groups. It can thus be used as a research methodology for 
      behavioural and neuroimaging studies of VWM in block-design paradigms.

AB  - Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that working memory (WM) task difficulty can 
      be decoded from patterns of brain activation in the WM network during preparation to 
      perform those tasks. The inter-regional connectivity among the WM regions during 
      task preparation has not yet been investigated. We examined this question using the 
      graph modeling methods IMaGES and LOFS, applied to the previously published fMRI 
      data of Manelis and Reder (2013). In that study, subjects performed 1-, 2-, and 
      3-back tasks. Each block of n-back was preceded by a preparation period and followed 
      by a rest period. The analyses of task-related brain activity identified a network 
      of 18 regions that increased in activation from 1- to 3-back (Increase network) and 
      a network of 17 regions that decreased in activation from 1- to 3-back (Decrease 
      network). The graph analyses revealed two types of connectivity sub-networks within 
      the Increase and Decrease networks: "default" and "preparation-related." The 
      "default" connectivity was present not only during task performance, but also during 
      task preparation and during rest. We propose that this sub-network may serve as a 
      core system that allows one to quickly activate cognitive, perceptual and motor 
      systems in response to the relevant stimuli. The "preparation-related" connectivity 
      was present during task preparation and task performance, but not at rest, and 
      depended on the n-back condition. The role of this sub-network may be to 
      pre-activate a connectivity "road map" in order to establish a top-down and 
      bottom-up regulation of attention prior to performance on WM tasks.

TI  - Evidence of a modality-dependent role of the cerebellum in working memory? An fMRI 
      study comparing verbal and abstract n-back tasks.
PG  - 2073-82
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.06.005 [doi]
AB  - In working memory (WM), functional imaging studies demonstrate cerebellar 
      involvement indicating a cognitive role of the cerebellum. These cognitive 
      contributions were predominantly interpreted as part of the phonological loop within 
      the Baddeley model of WM. However, those underlying investigations were performed in 
      the context of visual verbal WM which could pose a bias when interpreting the 
      results. The aim of this fMRI study was to address the question of whether the 
      cerebellum supports additional aspects of WM in the context of higher cognitive 
      functions. Furthermore, laterality effects were investigated to further disentangle 
      the cerebellar role in the context of the phonological loop and the visuospatial 
      sketchpad. A direct comparison of verbal and abstract visual WM was performed in 17 
      young volunteers by applying a 2-back paradigm and extracting the % change in BOLD 
      signal from the fMRI data. To minimize potential verbal strategies, Attneave and 
      Arnoult shapes of non-nameable objects were chosen for the abstract condition. The 
      analyses revealed no significant differences in verbal vs. abstract WM. Moreover, no 
      laterality effects were demonstrated in both verbal and abstract WM. These results 
      provide further evidence of a broader cognitive involvement of the cerebellum in WM 
      that is not only confined to the phonological loop but also supports central 
      executive subfunctions. The fact that no lateralization effects are found might be 
      attributed to the characteristics of the n-back paradigm which emphasizes central 
      executive subfunctions over the subsidiary slave systems.

TI  - Cerebral Inefficient Activation in Schizophrenia Patients and Their Unaffected 
      Parents during the N-Back Working Memory Task: A Family fMRI Study.
PG  - e0135468
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0135468 [doi]
LID - e0135468
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that working memory deficits is a core feature of 
      symptomatology of schizophrenia, which can be detected in patients and their 
      unaffected relatives. The impairment of working memory has been found related to the 
      abnormal activity of human brain regions in many functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) studies. This study investigated how brain region activation was 
      altered in schizophrenia and how it was inherited independently from performance 
      deficits. METHOD: The authors used fMRI method during N-back task to assess working 
      memory related cortical activation in four groups (N = 20 in each group, matching 
      task performance, age, gender and education): schizophrenic patients, their 
      unaffected biological parents, young healthy controls for the patients and older 
      healthy controls for their parents. RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, patients 
      showed an exaggerated response in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (brodmann 
      area [BA] 46) and bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and had reduced 
      activation in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 9). In the conjunction 
      analysis, the effect of genetic risk (parents versus older control) shared 
      significantly overlapped activation with effect of disease (patients versus young 
      control) in the right middle frontal gyrus (BA 46) and left inferior parietal gyrus 
      (BA 40). CONCLUSIONS: Physiological inefficiency of dorsal prefrontal cortex and 
      compensation involvement of ventral prefrontal cortex in working memory function may 
      one physiological characteristics of schizophrenia. And relatively inefficient 
      activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex probably can be a promising 
      intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia.

PG  - 1115-1127
LID - 10.1007/s11682-018-9925-x [doi]
AB  - Neurobehavioral effects of cognitive training have become a popular research issue. 
      Specifically, behavioral studies have demonstrated the long-term efficacy of 
      cognitive training of working memory functions, but the neural basis for this 
      training have been studied only at short-term. Using fMRI, we investigate the 
      cerebral changes produced by brief single n-back training immediately and 5 weeks 
      after finishing the training. We used the data from a sample of 52 participants who 
      were assigned to either an experimental condition (training group) or a no-contact 
      control condition. Both groups completed three fMRI sessions with the same n-back 
      task. Behavioral and brain effects were studied, comparing the conditions and 
      sessions in both groups. Our results showed that n-back training improved 
      performance in terms of accuracy and response speed in the trained group compared to 
      the control group. These behavioral changes in trained participants were associated 
      with decreased activation in various brain areas related to working memory, 
      specifically the frontal superior/middle cortex, inferior parietal cortex, anterior 
      cingulate cortex, and middle temporal cortex. Five weeks after training, the 
      behavioral and brain changes remained stable. We conclude that cognitive training 
      was associated with an improvement in behavioral performance and decreased brain 
      activation, suggesting better neural efficiency that persists over time.

AB  - Experiencing stress can have a disadvantageous effect on mental well-being. 
      Additional to the relation between suffering from chronic stress and depression, 
      both stress (acute and chronic) and depression are associated with cognitive 
      alterations, including working memory. The breakup of a relationship is considered 
      to be a stressful event that can lead to symptoms of depression in otherwise healthy 
      people. Additional to elevated depression scores, stress-related cognitive 
      alterations may occur in this population as well. Therefore, in the present fMRI 
      study we investigated whether experiencing a relationship breakup is associated with 
      working memory alterations and whether this is related to depressive symptom 
      severity. A three workload version of the n-back task (0-back, 1-back, 2-back) was 
      used to measure working memory in subjects who experienced a breakup in the 
      preceding 6 months ("heartbreak group", n = 70) and subjects in a romantic 
      relationship ("relationship group", n = 46). Behavioral task performance was 
      compared between the two groups. Functional MRI scans were analyzed using General 
      Linear Model (GLM) activation analyses. Workload conditions were contrasted to each 
      other and to baseline and group differences were assessed. To investigate whether 
      brain networks are associated with depressive symptom severity within the heartbreak 
      group specifically, a post hoc feature-based Independent Component Analysis was 
      performed on the 2-back > 0-back contrast images to identify brain regions that 
      covaried across subjects. Behaviorally, the heartbreak group performed similar at 
      high workload (i.e., 2-back) and better at moderate workload (i.e., 1-back) than the 
      relationship group. GLM analysis revealed an interaction between group and 2-back > 
      0-back, 2-back > 1-back and 2-back > baseline; the heartbreak group showed less 
      precuneus activation compared to the relationship group. Furthermore, within the 
      heartbreak group, we found a negative association between depressive symptom 
      severity and a brain network representing mostly the precuneus, anterior cingulate 
      gyrus and supplementary motor cortex. Our findings suggest that the effect of a 
      breakup is accompanied by workload-dependent working memory alterations. Therefore, 
      we propose that this population can potentially be used to investigate the interplay 
      between stress, cognitive functioning and depression.

AB  - Working memory-related brain activation has been widely studied, and impaired 
      activation patterns have been reported for several psychiatric disorders. We 
      investigated whether variation in N-back working memory brain activation is 
      genetically influenced in 60 pairs of twins, (29 monozygotic (MZ), 31 dizygotic 
      (DZ); mean age 24.4+/-1.7S.D.). Task-related brain response (BOLD percent signal 
      difference of 2 minus 0-back) was measured in three regions of interest. Although 
      statistical power was low due to the small sample size, for middle frontal gyrus, 
      angular gyrus, and supramarginal gyrus, the MZ correlations were, in general, 
      approximately twice those of the DZ pairs, with non-significant heritability 
      estimates (14-30%) in the low-moderate range. Task performance was strongly 
      influenced by genes (57-73%) and highly correlated with cognitive ability 
      (0.44-0.55). This study, which will be expanded over the next 3 years, provides the 
      first support that individual variation in working memory-related brain activation 
      is to some extent influenced by genes.

TI  - Cognitive control and brain resources in major depression: an fMRI study using the 
      n-back task.
PG  - 860-9
AB  - Several neuroimaging studies have reported 'hypofrontality' in depressed patients 
      performing a cognitive challenge compared to control subjects. Hypofrontality in 
      depression is likely associated with an impaired behavioral performance. It is 
      unclear whether this impaired performance is the consequence or the cause of 
      hypofrontality. Consequently, we proposed to compare the cerebral activity of 
      depressed patients and healthy subjects while controlling for the level of 
      performance. Ten individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria for Major Depression and 10 
      healthy controls were tested with a verbal version of the n-back task during fMRI 
      scanning. The working memory load was manipulated across the experiment (1,2,3-back) 
      to increase the cognitive demands. fMRI data were acquired on a 1.5-T GE scanner and 
      analyzed using SPM99 software. We did not find any difference between groups in both 
      performance and reaction times for each level of complexity of the n-back task. 
      Depressed patients and control subjects showed bilateral activation of the lateral 
      prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate and parietal cortex. Activation of these 
      regions was modulated by the complexity of the task. Within this n-back neural 
      network, depressed patients showed greater activation of the lateral prefrontal 
      cortex and the anterior cingulate compared to healthy subjects. This study provides 
      evidence that depressed patients need greater activation within the same neural 
      network to maintain a similar level of performance as controls during a working 
      memory task. Our findings suggest that depression may impair the cognitive capacity 
      of depressed patients by recruiting more brain resources than controls during 
      cognitive control.

TI  - Neurocognitive correlates of working memory and emotional processing in postpartum 
      psychosis: an fMRI study.
PG  - 1724-1732
LID - 10.1017/S0033291720000471 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postpartum psychosis (PP) is a severe postpartum disorder. While working 
      memory and emotional processing-related brain function are consistently impaired in 
      psychoses unrelated to the puerperium, no studies have investigated them in PP. 
      METHODS: Twenty-four women at risk of developing PP (11 developed an episode - PE; 
      13 remained well - NPE) and 20 healthy postpartum women completed two functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging tasks within a year of delivery: working memory (n-back) 
      and emotional face recognition (fearful faces). We compared women at-risk of PP to 
      controls, as well as NPE, PE, and controls to test for potential effects of a PP 
      episode occurrence. RESULTS: Women at-risk of PP and PE showed hyperactivation of 
      lateral visual areas, precuneus, and posterior cingulate during the n-back task. The 
      at-risk group as a whole, as well as the PE and NPE groups, showed hyperconnectivity 
      of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with various 
      parieto-occipito-temporo-cerebellar regions compared to controls during several 
      n-back conditions. Increases in connectivity between the right DLPFC and ipsilateral 
      middle temporal gyrus were observed in the PE group compared to NPE during 2-back. 
      During the fearful faces task, at-risk women as a group showed hyperactivation of 
      fronto-cingulo-subcortical regions, and hypoconnectivity between the left amygdala 
      and ipsilateral occipito-parietal regions compared to controls. No significant 
      performance differences were observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results present 
      preliminary evidence of a differential nature of functional brain abnormalities in 
      PP compared to the typically observed reduced connectivity with the DLPFC in 
      psychoses unrelated to puerperium, such as bipolar disorder.

TI  - Working memory for complex figures: an fMRI comparison of letter and fractal n-back 
      tasks.
PG  - 370-9
AB  - n-back letter and fractal tasks were administered to 11 participants during 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging to test process specificity theories of 
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) function and assess task validity. Tasks were matched on 
      accuracy, but fractal n-back responses were slower and more conservative. 
      Maintenance (1-back minus 0-back) activated inferior parietal and dorsolateral PFC, 
      with additional activation in right ventrolateral PFC during letter n-back and left 
      lingual gyrus during fractal n-back. Maintenance plus manipulation (2-back minus 
      0-back) activated inferior parietal, Broca's area, insula, and dorsolateral and 
      ventral PFC, with greater right dorsolateral PFC activation for letter n-back. 
      Manipulation only (2-back minus 1-back) produced additional and equivalent 
      dorsolateral PFC and anterior cingulate activation in both tasks. Results support 
      fractal n-back validity and indicate substantial overlap in working memory functions 
      of dorsal and ventral PFC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Working memory (WM) is an executive ability that allows one to hold and 
      manipulate information for a short period of time. Schizophrenia and mood disorders 
      are severe psychiatric conditions with overlapping genetic and clinical symptoms. 
      Whilst WM has been suggested as meeting the criteria for being an endophenotype for 
      schizophrenia and mood disorders, it still unclear whether they share overlapping 
      neural circuitry. OBJECTIVE: The n-back task has been widely used to measure WM 
      capacity, such as maintenance, flexible updating, and interference control. Here we 
      compiled studies that included psychiatric populations, i.e., schizophrenia, bipolar 
      disorder and major depressive disorder. METHODS: We performed a coordinate-based 
      meta-analysis that combined 34 BOLD-fMRI studies comparing activity associated with 
      n-back working memory between psychiatric patients and healthy controls. We 
      specifically focused our search using the n-back task to diminish study 
      heterogeneity. RESULTS: All patient groups showed blunted activity in the striatum, 
      anterior insula and frontal lobe. The same brain networks related to WM were 
      compromised in schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. 
      CONCLUSION: Our findings support the suggestion of commonal functional abnormalities 
      across schizophrenia and mood disorders related to WM.

AB  - The tremendous changes in brain structure over childhood are critical to the 
      development of cognitive functions. Neuroimaging provides a means of linking these 
      brain-behaviour relations, as task protocols can be adapted for use with young 
      children to assess the development of cognitive functions in both typical and 
      atypical populations. This paper reviews some of our research using 
      magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional MRI (fMRI) in the study of cognitive 
      development, with a focus on frontal lobe functions. Working memory for complex 
      abstract patterns showed clear development in terms of the recruitment of frontal 
      regions, seen with fMRI, with indications of strategy differences across the age 
      range, from 6 to 35 years of age. Right hippocampal involvement was also evident in 
      these n-back tasks, demonstrating its involvement in recognition in simple working 
      memory protocols. Children born very preterm (7 to 9 years of age) showed reduced 
      fMRI activation particularly in the precuneus and right hippocampal regions relative 
      to control children. In a large normative n-back study (n=90) with upright and 
      inverted faces, MEG data also showed right hippocampal activation that was present 
      across the age range; frontal sources were evident only from 10 years of age. Other 
      studies have investigated the development of set shifting, an executive function 
      that is often deficit in atypical populations. fMRI showed recruitment of frontal 
      areas, including the insula, that have significantly different patterns in children 
      (7 to 14 years of age) with autism spectrum disorder compared to typically 
      developing children, indicating that successful performance implicated differing 
      strategies in these two groups of children. These types of studies will help our 
      understanding of both normal brain-behaviour development and cognitive dysfunction 
      in atypically developing populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD) show deficits in 
      working memory (WM) performance accompanied by bilateral fronto-parietal BOLD signal 
      changes. It is unclear whether patients with a first depressive episode (FDE) 
      exhibit the same signal changes as patients with recurrent depressive episodes 
      (RDE). METHODS: We investigated seventy-four MDD inpatients (48 RDE, 26 FDE) and 74 
      healthy control (HC) subjects performing an n-back WM task (0-back, 2-back, 3-back 
      condition) in a 3T-fMRI. RESULTS: FMRI analyses revealed deviating BOLD signal in 
      MDD in the thalamus (0-back vs. 2-back), the angular gyrus (0-back vs. 3-back), and 
      the superior frontal gyrus (2-back vs. 3-back). Further effects were observed 
      between RDE vs. FDE. Thus, RDE displayed differing neural activation in the middle 
      frontal gyrus (2-back vs. 3-back), the inferior frontal gyrus, and the precentral 
      gyrus (0-back vs. 2-back). In addition, both HC and FDE indicated a linear 
      activation trend depending on task complexity. CONCLUSIONS: Although we failed to 
      find behavioral differences between the groups, results suggest differing BOLD 
      signal in fronto-parietal brain regions in MDD vs. HC, and in RDE vs. FDE. Moreover, 
      both HC and FDE show similar trends in activation shapes. This indicates a link 
      between levels of complexity-dependent activation in fronto-parietal brain regions 
      and the stage of MDD. We therefore assume that load-dependent BOLD signal during WM 
      is impaired in MDD, and that it is particularly affected in RDE. We also suspect 
      neurobiological compensatory mechanisms of the reported brain regions in (working) 
      memory functioning.

AB  - Reliable measures of cognitive brain activity from functional neuroimaging 
      techniques may provide early indications of efficacy in clinical trials. Functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography provide complementary 
      spatiotemporal information and simultaneous recording of these two modalities can 
      remove inter-session drug response and environment variability. We sought to assess 
      the effects of ketamine and midazolam on simultaneous electrophysiological and 
      hemodynamic recordings during working memory (WM) processes. Thirty participants 
      were included in a placebo-controlled, three-way crossover design with ketamine and 
      midazolam. Compared to placebo, ketamine administration attenuated theta power 
      increases and alpha power decreases and midazolam attenuated low beta band decreases 
      to increasing WM load. Additionally, ketamine caused larger blood-oxygen-dependent 
      (BOLD) signal increases in the supplementary motor area and angular gyrus, and 
      weaker deactivations of the default mode network (DMN), whereas no difference was 
      found between midazolam and placebo. Ketamine administration caused positive 
      temporal correlations between frontal-midline theta (fm-theta) power and the BOLD 
      signal to disappear and attenuated negative correlations. However, the relationship 
      between fm-theta and the BOLD signal from DMN areas was maintained in some 
      participants during ketamine administration, as increasing theta strength was 
      associated with stronger BOLD signal reductions in these areas. The presence of, and 
      ability to manipulate, both positive and negative associations between the BOLD 
      signal and fm-theta suggest the presence of multiple fm-theta components involved in 
      WM processes, with ketamine administration disrupting one or more of these 
      theta-linked WM strategies.

AB  - The functional organization of the human brain adapts dynamically in response to a 
      rapidly changing environment. However, the relation of these rapid changes in 
      functional organization to cognitive functioning is not well understood. This study 
      used a graph-based time-frame modularity analysis approach to identify temporally 
      recurrent functional configuration patterns in neural responses to an n-back working 
      memory task during fMRI. Working memory load was manipulated to investigate the 
      functional relevance of the identified brain states. Four distinct brain states were 
      defined by the predominant patterns of activation in the task-positive, 
      default-mode, sensorimotor, and visual networks. Associated with escalating working 
      memory load, the occurrence of the task-positive state and the probability of 
      transitioning into this state increased. In contrast, the occurrence of the 
      default-mode and sensorimotor states and the probability of these 2 states 
      transitioning away from the task-positive state decreased. The task-positive state 
      occurrence rate and the probability of transitioning from the default-mode state 
      back to the task-positive state explained a significant and unique portion of the 
      variance in task performance. The results demonstrate that dynamic brain activities 
      support successful cognitive functioning and may have heuristic value for 
      understanding abnormal cognitive functioning associated with multiple 
      neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Adolescents with epilepsy are at risk for deficits in working memory, which could 
      lead to learning difficulties and poor academic outcomes. We used task-based 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine potential disruption in 
      working memory function in adolescents with epilepsy as compared to healthy 
      controls. We recruited 29 adolescents (13-17 years) with non-lesional epilepsy and 
      20 healthy controls. All participants performed an N-back fMRI task and 
      neuropsychological testing. A general linear model approach was used to create group 
      activation maps of N-back fMRI for epilepsy and control groups and both groups 
      combined (p < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons). Functionally defined regions 
      of interest (ROIs) were identified based on clusters of combined group activation 
      (z > 5). Subsets of these functional ROIs corresponding to cingulo-opercular and 
      fronto-parietal networks were selected and differences in functional connectivity 
      between the epilepsy and control groups were assessed. Adolescents with epilepsy had 
      significantly poorer working memory scores compared to controls. For the N-back fMRI 
      task, there were no significant differences in group activation. Functional 
      connectivity was significantly reduced between the left frontal operculum and 
      anterior cingulate gyrus (cingulo-opercular network) in adolescents with epilepsy 
      compared to controls. This study demonstrates working memory deficits and an altered 
      pattern of connectivity in brain networks supporting working memory in adolescents 
      with epilepsy. Working memory performance was worse in adolescents with epilepsy; 
      though scores were not directly correlated with reduced connectivity. These results 
      suggest the neural substrates of working memory in adolescents with epilepsy may 
      differ from those in typically-developing adolescents, and require further 
      investigation to understand the reasons for poorer working memory performance.

AB  - Despite the well-described deleterious effects of aging on cognition, some 
      individuals are able to show stability. Here, we aimed to describe the functional 
      and structural brain characteristics of older individuals, particularly focusing on 
      those with stable working memory (WM) performance, as measured with a verbal N-back 
      task across a 2-year follow-up interval. Forty-seven subjects were categorized as 
      stables or decliners based on their WM change. Stables were further subdivided into 
      high performers (SHP) and low performers (SLP), based on their baseline scores. At 
      both time points, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were acquired, including 
      task-based functional MRI (fMRI) and structural T1-MRI. Although there was no 
      significant interaction between overall stables and decliners as regards fMRI 
      patterns, decliners exhibited over-activation in the right superior parietal lobule 
      at follow-up as compared to baseline, while SHP showed reduced the activity in this 
      region. Further, at follow-up, decliners exhibited more activity than SHP but in 
      left temporo-parietal cortex and posterior cingulate (i.e., non-task-related areas). 
      Also, at the cross-sectional level, SLP showed lower activity than SHP at both time 
      points and less activity than decliners at follow-up. Concerning brain structure, a 
      generalized significant cortical thinning over time was identified for the whole 
      sample. Notwithstanding, the decliners evidenced a greater rate of atrophy 
      comprising the posterior middle and inferior temporal gyrus as compared to the 
      stable group. Overall, fMRI data suggest unsuccessful compensation in the case of 
      decliners, shown as increases in functional recruitment during the task in the 
      context of a loss in WM performance and brain atrophy. On the other hand, among 
      older individuals with WM cognitive stability, differences in baseline performance 
      might determine dissimilar fMRI trajectories. In this vein, the findings in the SHP 
      subgroup support the brain maintenance hypothesis, suggesting that stable and high 
      WM performance in aging is sustained by functional efficiency and maintained brain 
      structure rather than compensatory changes.

AB  - Working memory (WM) refers to a set of cognitive processes that allows for the 
      temporary storage and manipulation of information, crucial for everyday life skills. 
      WM deficits are present in several neurological, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental 
      disorders, thus making the full understanding of its neural correlates a key aspect 
      for the implementation of cognitive training interventions. Here, we present a 
      quantitative meta-analysis focusing on the underlying neural substrates upon which 
      the n-back, one of the most commonly used tasks for WM assessment, is believed to 
      rely on, as highlighted by functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron 
      emission tomography findings. Relevant published work was scrutinized through the 
      activation likelihood estimate (ALE) statistical framework in order to generate a 
      set of task-specific activation maps, according to n-back difficulty. Our results 
      confirm the known involvement of frontoparietal areas across different types of 
      n-back tasks, as well as the recruitment of subcortical structures, cerebellum and 
      precuneus. Specific activations maps for four stimuli types, six presentation 
      modalities, three WM loads and their combination are provided and discussed. 
      Moreover, functional overlap with resting-state networks highlighted a strong 
      similarity between n-back nodes and the Dorsal Attention Network, with less overlap 
      with other networks like Salience, Language, and Sensorimotor ones. Additionally, 
      neural deactivations during n-back tasks and their functional connectivity profile 
      were examined. Clinical and functional implications are discussed in the context of 
      potential noninvasive brain stimulation and cognitive enhancement/rehabilitation 
      programs.

TI  - Constrained temporal parallel decomposition for EEG-fMRI fusion.
PG  - 016017
LID - 10.1088/1741-2552/aaefda [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Multimodal neuroimaging has become a common practice in neuroscience 
      research. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI is a popular multimodal recording approach due to 
      the complementary spatiotemporal relationship between the two modalities. Several 
      data fusion techniques have been proposed in the literature for EEG-fMRI fusion, 
      including joint-ICA and parallel-ICA frameworks. Previous EEG-fMRI fusion approaches 
      have used sensor-level EEG features. Recently, we introduced source-space ICA for 
      EEG-MEG source reconstruction and component identification, which was shown to be a 
      superior alternative to sensor-space ICA. APPROACH: Here, we extend source-space ICA 
      to the fusion of EEG-fMRI data. Additionally, we incorporate the use of a paradigm 
      signal (constrained) and a lag-based signal decomposition approach to accommodate 
      recent findings demonstrating the potentially variable lag structure between 
      electrophysiological and BOLD signals. We evaluated this method on simulated 
      concurrent EEG-fMRI during a boxcar task design, as well as real concurrent EEG-fMRI 
      data from three participants performing an N-Back working memory task. The block 
      diagram of the algorithm and corresponding source codes are provided. MAIN RESULTS: 
      Based on the results of the real working memory task, for all three subjects, one 
      frontal theta component, and one right posterior alpha component had the highest 
      contribution coefficients (~0.5) to the paradigm-related fused component. There were 
      also two more alpha band components with contribution coefficients of 0.3. The 
      highest contributing fMRI component (~0.8) was one known in the literature to be 
      related to the attention network. The second fMRI component was related to the 
      well-known default mode network, with a contribution coefficient of 0.3. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed EEG-fMRI fusion approach, is capable of estimating the 
      brain maps of the EEG and fMRI for the fused components and account for the variable 
      lag structure between electrophysiological and BOLD signals.

AB  - Neuroimaging research frequently demonstrates load-dependent activation in 
      prefrontal and parietal cortex during working memory tasks such as the N-back. Most 
      of this work has been conducted in fMRI, but functional near-infrared spectroscopy 
      (fNIRS) is gaining traction as a less invasive and more flexible alternative to 
      measuring cortical hemodynamics. Few fNIRS studies, however, have examined how 
      working memory load-dependent changes in brain hemodynamics relate to performance. 
      The current study employs a newly developed and robust statistical analysis of 
      task-based fNIRS data in a large sample, and demonstrates the utility of 
      data-driven, multivariate analyses to link brain activation and behavior in this 
      modality. Seventy participants completed a standard N-back task with three N-back 
      levels (N = 1, 2, 3) while fNIRS data were collected from frontal and parietal 
      cortex. Overall, participants showed reliably greater fronto-parietal activation for 
      the 2-back versus the 1-back task, suggesting fronto-parietal fNIRS measurements are 
      sensitive to differences in cognitive load. The results for 3-back were much less 
      consistent, potentially due to poor behavioral performance in the 3-back task. To 
      address this, a multivariate analysis (behavioral partial least squares, PLS) was 
      conducted to examine the interaction between fNIRS activation and performance at 
      each N-back level. Results of the PLS analysis demonstrated differences in the 
      relationship between accuracy and change in the deoxyhemoglobin fNIRS signal as a 
      function of N-back level in eight mid-frontal channels. Specifically, greater 
      reductions in deoxyhemoglobin (i.e., more activation) were positively related to 
      performance on the 3-back task, unrelated to accuracy in the 2-back task, and 
      negatively associated with accuracy in the 1-back task. This pattern of results 
      suggests that the metabolic demands correlated with neural activity required for 
      high levels of accuracy vary as a consequence of task difficulty/cognitive load, 
      whereby more automaticity during the 1-back task (less mid-frontal activity) 
      predicted superior performance on this relatively easy task, and successful 
      engagement of this mid-frontal region was required for high accuracy on a more 
      difficult and cognitively demanding 3-back task. In summary, we show that fNIRS 
      activity can track working memory load and can uncover significant associations 
      between brain activity and performance, thus opening the door for this modality to 
      be used in more wide-spread applications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although nutritional and metabolic factors are well established in 
      obesity, neurocognitive determinants are less understood. Using data from the Human 
      Connectome Project, this study concurrently investigated neurocognitive performance, 
      neural activation during a working memory task, and cortical brain morphometry in 
      relation to obesity in a group of young adults, 22-35 years old. METHODS: Using a 
      case-control design, obese individuals (n = 243, body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) 
      were compared to a control group of lean BMI individuals (n = 469, 
      BMI = 18-24.9 kg/m(2)). Performance tests comprised a battery of behavioral 
      neurocognitive assessments. Neural activity was measured as 
      blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) activity during an N-Back task using 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Cortical morphometry included indices 
      of volume, thickness, and surface area. RESULTS: Relative to the control group, the 
      obese group exhibited significantly worse performance in terms of the National 
      Institutes of Health Toolkit (NIH) 9-Hole Peg Board, Penn Working Memory Test, Delay 
      Discounting, Penn Progressive Matrices, NIH Picture Vocabulary Test, Dimensional 
      Change Card Sort Test and the in-scanner N-Back working memory test (FDR-corrected 
      ps<0.05; ds = 0.231-0.405). The obese group also exhibited significantly greater 
      BOLD activation in N-Back task-negative regions, including the ventromedial 
      prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, and right precentral gyrus (FDR-corrected 
      ps<0.05). Supplemental functional connectivity analyses provided evidence that the 
      implicated regions were part of the default mode network. Significant differences in 
      morphometry were present in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, rostral anterior 
      cingulate cortex, inferior and superior parietal gyri, and temporal pole 
      (FDR-corrected p<0.001). A data-driven integrative model classified 73.8% of 
      participants correctly. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This multimodal investigation 
      suggests diverse aspects of neurocognition are associated with obesity, particularly 
      implicating deficits in executive function and ineffective suppression of the 
      default mode network.

AB  - Emotion processing is known to interact with memory. Ovarian steroid hormones, such 
      as progesterone and estradiol, modulate emotion processing and memory. However, it 
      is unclear how these hormones influence brain activity when emotion processing is 
      integrated with working memory (WM). Therefore, the objective of this study was to 
      examine the relationship between endogenous hormonal concentration and brain 
      activity during emotion processing in the context of a WM n-back task in 74 young 
      women using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results show that positive 
      emotion processing activates reward-related areas, such as the caudate and putamen, 
      whereas negative emotion processing activates a corticolimbic network, including the 
      amygdala and hippocampus. Furthermore, our findings provide evidence that 
      progesterone modulates more bottom-up brain activation during both positive and 
      negative emotion processing, whereas estradiol activates lateralized, top-down 
      regulation. These findings provide insight on the neural correlates of emotion 
      processing during an n-back task in young women and highlight how important it is to 
      consider women's endogenous hormonal concentration in neurobiological and cognition 
      research.

TI  - Functional Connectivity during Encoding Predicts Individual Differences in Long-Term 
      Memory.
PG  - 2279-2296
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_01759 [doi]
AB  - What is the neural basis of individual differences in the ability to hold 
      information in long-term memory (LTM)? Here, we first characterize two whole-brain 
      functional connectivity networks based on fMRI data acquired during an n-back task 
      that robustly predict individual differences in two important forms of LTM, 
      recognition and recollection. We then focus on the recognition memory model and 
      contrast it with a working memory model. Although functional connectivity during the 
      n-back task also predicts working memory performance and the two networks have some 
      shared components, they are also largely distinct from each other: The recognition 
      memory model performance remains robust when we control for working memory, and vice 
      versa. Functional connectivity only within regions traditionally associated with LTM 
      formation, such as the medial temporal lobe and those that show univariate 
      subsequent memory effect, have little predictive power for both forms of LTM. 
      Interestingly, the interactions between these regions and other brain regions play a 
      more substantial role in predicting recollection memory than recognition memory. 
      These results demonstrate that individual differences in LTM are dependent on the 
      configuration of a whole-brain functional network including but not limited to 
      regions associated with LTM during encoding and that such a network is separable 
      from what supports the retention of information in working memory.

AB  - Genetic risk for schizophrenia is associated with impairments in the initiation and 
      performance of executive control of cognition and action. The nature of these 
      impairments and of the neural dysfunction that underlies them has been extensively 
      investigated using experimental psychology and neuroimaging methods. In this 
      article, we review schizophrenia-associated functional connectivity and activation 
      abnormalities found in subjects performing experimental tasks that engage different 
      aspects of executive function, such as working memory, cognitive control, and 
      response inhibition. We focus on heritable traits associated with schizophrenia risk 
      (intermediate phenotypes or endophenotypes) that have been revealed using imaging 
      genetics approaches. These data suggest that genetic risk for schizophrenia is 
      associated with dysfunction in systems supporting the initiation and application of 
      executive control in neural circuits involving the anterior cingulate and 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This article discusses current findings and 
      limitations and their potential relevance to symptoms and disease pathogenesis.

AB  - There is a growing consensus regarding the positive relationship between physical 
      function and working memory; however, explanations of task-evoked functional 
      activity regarding this relationship and its differences in physical function 
      domains remain controversial. This study illustrates the cross-sectional 
      relationships between cardiorespiratory fitness, gait speed, hand dexterity, and 
      muscular strength with working memory task (N-back task) performance and the 
      mediating effects of task-evoked functional activity in 1033 adults aged between 22 
      and 37 years. The results showed that cardiorespiratory fitness and hand dexterity 
      were independently associated with N-back task performance to a greater extent and 
      in contrast to gait speed and muscular strength. These relationships were mediated 
      by task-evoked functional activity in a part of the frontoparietal network (FPN) and 
      default mode network (DMN). Superior cardiorespiratory fitness could contribute to 
      working memory performance by enhancing the compensational role of FPN-related 
      broader region activation. Hand dexterity was associated with moderation of the 
      interaction in terms of task-evoked activation between the FPN and DMN, which in 
      turn, improved N-back task performance. Based on these findings, we conclude that 
      cardiorespiratory fitness and hand dexterity have common and unique mechanisms 
      enhancing working memory.

TI  - The Effects of Working Memory Training on Brain Activity.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci11020155 [doi]
LID - 155
AB  - This study aimed to investigate if two weeks of working memory (WM) training on a 
      progressive N-back task can generate changes in the activity of the underlying WM 
      neural network. Forty-six healthy volunteers (23 training and 23 controls) were 
      asked to perform the N-back task during three fMRI scanning sessions: (1) before 
      training, (2) after the half of training sessions, and (3) at the end. Between the 
      scanning sessions, the experimental group underwent a 10-session training of working 
      memory with the use of an adaptive version of the N-back task, while the control 
      group did not train anything. The N-back task in the scanning sessions was 
      relatively easy (n = 2) in order to ensure high accuracy and a lack of between-group 
      differences at the behavioral level. Such training-induced differences in neural 
      efficiency were expected. Behavioral analyses revealed improved performance of both 
      groups on the N-back task. However, these improvements resulted from the test-retest 
      effect, not the training outside scanner. Performance on the non-trained stop-signal 
      task did not demonstrate any transfer effect. Imaging analysis showed changes in 
      activation in several significant clusters, with overlapping regions of interest in 
      the frontal and parietal lobes. However, patterns of between-session changes of 
      activation did not show any effect of training. The only finding that can be linked 
      with training consists in strengthening the correlation between task performance 
      accuracy and activation of the parietal regions of the neural network subserving 
      working memory (left superior parietal lobule and right supramarginal gyrus 
      posterior). These results suggest that the effects of WM training consist in 
      learning that, in order to ensure high accuracy in the criterion task, activation of 
      the parietal regions implicated in working memory updating must rise.

AB  - Working memory function changes across development and varies across individuals. 
      The patterns of behavior and brain function that track individual differences in 
      working memory during human development, however, are not well understood. Here, we 
      establish associations between working memory, other cognitive abilities, and 
      functional MRI (fMRI) activation in data from over 11,500 9- to 10-year-old children 
      (both sexes) enrolled in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, an 
      ongoing longitudinal study in the United States. Behavioral analyses reveal robust 
      relationships between working memory, short-term memory, language skills, and fluid 
      intelligence. Analyses relating out-of-scanner working memory performance to 
      memory-related fMRI activation in an emotional n-back task demonstrate that 
      frontoparietal activity during a working memory challenge indexes working memory 
      performance. This relationship is domain specific, such that fMRI activation related 
      to emotion processing during the emotional n-back task, inhibitory control during a 
      stop-signal task (SST), and reward processing during a monetary incentive delay 
      (MID) task does not track memory abilities. Together, these results inform our 
      understanding of individual differences in working memory in childhood and lay the 
      groundwork for characterizing the ways in which they change across 
      adolescence.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Working memory is a foundational cognitive 
      ability that changes over time and varies across individuals. Here, we analyze data 
      from over 11,500 9- to 10-year-olds to establish relationships between working 
      memory, other cognitive abilities, and frontoparietal brain activity during a 
      working memory challenge, but not during other cognitive challenges. Our results lay 
      the groundwork for assessing longitudinal changes in working memory and predicting 
      later academic and other real-world outcomes.

AB  - The study of healthy brain development helps to better understand both brain 
      transformation and connectivity patterns, which happen during childhood to 
      adulthood. This study presents a sparse machine learning solution across whole-brain 
      functional connectivity measures of three datasets, derived from resting state 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and two task fMRI data including a 
      working memory n-back task (nb-fMRI) and an emotion identification task (em-fMRI). 
      The fMRI data are collected from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) 
      for the prediction of brain age in adolescents. Due to extremely large 
      variable-to-instance ratio of PNC data, a high-dimensional matrix with several 
      irrelevant and highly correlated features is generated, and hence a sparse learning 
      approach is necessary to extract effective features from fMRI data. We propose a 
      sparse learner based on the residual errors along the estimation of an inverse 
      problem for extreme learning machine (ELM). Our proposed method is able to overcome 
      the overlearning problem by pruning several redundant features and their 
      corresponding output weights. The proposed multimodal sparse ELM classifier based on 
      residual errors is highly competitive in terms of classification accuracy compared 
      to its counterparts such as conventional ELM, and sparse Bayesian learning ELM.

TI  - Abnormalities of dorsolateral prefrontal function in women with premenstrual 
      dysphoric disorder: a multimodal neuroimaging study.
PG  - 305-14
LID - 10.1176/appi.ajp.2012.12030385 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the neural substrate of premenstrual dysphoric disorder 
      (PMDD), the authors used [15O]H2O positron emission tomography (PET) regional 
      cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI 
      (fMRI) signal measurements during working memory in conjunction with a 6-month 
      hormone manipulation protocol. METHOD: PET and fMRI scans were obtained from women 
      with prospectively confirmed PMDD and asymptomatic comparison subjects while they 
      completed the n-back task during three hormone conditions: ovarian suppression 
      induced by the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist leuprolide acetate, leuprolide 
      plus estradiol, and leuprolide plus progesterone. Fifteen patients and 15 matched 
      comparison subjects underwent PET imaging. Fourteen patients and 14 comparison 
      subjects underwent fMRI. For each hormone condition, rCBF was measured with [15O]H2O 
      PET, and BOLD signal was measured with fMRI, both during an n-back working memory 
      paradigm. Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF) scores and clinical 
      characteristics were obtained for each patient before hormone manipulation, and 
      symptoms were measured before and during the protocol. RESULTS: In both the PET and 
      fMRI studies, a main effect of diagnosis was observed, with PMDD patients showing 
      greater prefrontal activation than comparison subjects. In the patient group, the 
      degree to which dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation was abnormally increased 
      correlated with several dimensions of disease: disability as indicated by GAF 
      scores, age at symptom onset, duration of PMDD, and differences in pre- and 
      postmenses PMDD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal working memory activation in PMDD, 
      specifically in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, is related to PMDD severity, 
      symptoms, age at onset, and disease burden. These results support the clinical 
      relevance of the findings and the proposal that dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
      dysfunction represents a substrate of risk for PMDD. The concordance of the fMRI and 
      PET data attests to the neurobiological validity of the results.

AB  - The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study(®) is a 10-year longitudinal 
      study of children recruited at ages 9 and 10. A battery of neuroimaging tasks are 
      administered biennially to track neurodevelopment and identify individual 
      differences in brain function. This study reports activation patterns from 
      functional MRI (fMRI) tasks completed at baseline, which were designed to measure 
      cognitive impulse control with a stop signal task (SST; N = 5,547), reward 
      anticipation and receipt with a monetary incentive delay (MID) task (N = 6,657) and 
      working memory and emotion reactivity with an emotional N-back (EN-back) task 
      (N = 6,009). Further, we report the spatial reproducibility of activation patterns 
      by assessing between-group vertex/voxelwise correlations of blood oxygen 
      level-dependent (BOLD) activation. Analyses reveal robust brain activations that are 
      consistent with the published literature, vary across fMRI tasks/contrasts and 
      slightly correlate with individual behavioral performance on the tasks. These 
      results establish the preadolescent brain function baseline, guide interpretation of 
      cross-sectional analyses and will enable the investigation of longitudinal changes 
      during adolescent development.

AB  - Some women report cognitive impairment after adjuvant chemotherapy (CTh) for breast 
      cancer. Here we explore cognitive function, and underlying mechanisms with blood 
      tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Women treated for early 
      breast cancer were recruited to three groups based on self-reported cognitive 
      symptoms (CS) using FACT-Cog scores. CTh + CS+ (n = 44) had received chemotherapy 
      and self-reported cognitive symptoms; CTh + CS- (n = 52) had chemotherapy but did 
      not report cognitive problems; CTh- (n = 30) had not received chemotherapy. Clinical 
      and computer-based neuropsychological tests were performed. Blood tests included 10 
      cytokines, sex hormones, coagulation factors, and apolipoprotein-E genotype. fMRI 
      (n = 101) was performed while subjects performed an n-back memory task. Participants 
      had median age 50 (range: 29-60) years and were a median of 17 months 
      post-diagnosis. On clinical neuropsychological tests 19% had cognitive impairment 
      using Global Deficit Score, and 36% using International Cancer and Cognition Task 
      Force criteria with no significant differences in cognitive impairment rates between 
      groups. CTh + CS+ had significantly more fatigue, anxiety/depression and poorer 
      quality-of-life than other groups. There was no association between FACT-Cog and 
      neuropsychological scores. There were significant differences in frontal and 
      parietal regions on fMRI scans: CTh- showed hyperactivation compared to 
      chemotherapy-treated groups, CTh + CS+ had more frontal activation than CTh + CS-. 
      Elevated IL-1, IL-2 were associated weakly and IL-8 more strongly with 
      neuropsychological impairment (rho > 0.20). There were no differences in global 
      cognitive impairment between groups. Cognitive symptoms were associated with fatigue 
      and anxiety/depression, but not with objective cognitive impairment. fMRI scans 
      differed among the three groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: People with traumatic brain injury (TBI) often experience fatigue, but 
      an understanding of the neural underpinnings of fatigue following TBI is still 
      lacking. This study used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (rs-fMRI) to examine associations between functional connectivity (FC) changes and 
      task-induced changes in subjective fatigue in people with moderate-severe TBI. 
      METHODS: Sixteen people with moderate-severe TBI and 17 matched healthy controls 
      (HC) performed an adaptive N-back task (working memory task) to induce cognitive 
      fatigue. Before and after the task they rated their state fatigue level and 
      underwent rs-fMRI. Seed-to-voxel analyses with seeds in areas involved in cognitive 
      fatigue, namely the striatum and default mode network (DMN) including, medial 
      prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, were performed. RESULTS: The 
      adaptive N-back task was effective in inducing fatigue in both groups. Subjective 
      task-induced fatigue was positively associated with FC between striatum and 
      precuneus in people with TBI, while there was a negative association in HC. In 
      contrast, subjective task-induced fatigue was negatively associated with FC between 
      striatum and cerebellum in the TBI group, while there was no association in HC. 
      Similar associations between task-induced subjective fatigue and DMN FC were found 
      across the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the subjective experience 
      of fatigue was linked to DMN connectivity in both groups and was differently 
      associated with striatal connectivity in people with moderate-severe TBI compared to 
      HC. Defining fatigue-induced neuronal network changes is pertinent to the 
      development of treatments that target abnormal neuronal activity after TBI.

TI  - The effects of escitalopram on working memory and brain activity in healthy adults 
      during performance of the n-back task.
PG  - 339-47
AB  - RATIONALE: Psychotropic medication affects cognition and brain function, making it a 
      potential confounder in functional neuroimaging studies of psychiatric patients. 
      OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the sub-acute administration of an antidepressant 
      (escitalopram) would induce differences in cognitive performance and associated 
      brain function, which could be observed within the normal power of a functional 
      imaging study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy adults (N=10) received a short course 
      of escitalopram (10 mg/day for 7 days). Participants performed a parametric working 
      memory (WM) task during BOLD fMRI, both while medication-free and after medication. 
      To control for order effects, the medication-free examination was completed by half 
      the subjects before starting medication and by the other half at least one week 
      after medication. RESULTS: Escitalopram had no significant effect on WM accuracy or 
      reaction time. Preliminary analysis of the imaging data revealed no significant 
      (p(corrected)<0.05) differences in memory-load-dependent activation between 
      conditions. However, small volume correction analysis of regions that were 
      significant prior to correction for multiple comparisons highlighted between 
      condition differences in regions likely to be susceptible to antidepressant effects 
      (i.e. thalamus, anterior cingulate and inferior frontal gyrus). CONCLUSIONS: These 
      results suggest that the sub-acute administration of antidepressants in healthy 
      controls does not affect cognitive or hemodynamic function in healthy adults to a 
      magnitude greater than one standard deviation unit. Therefore, the confounding 
      effect of antidepressants on signal intensity in imaging studies of medicated, 
      depressed individuals may be limited.

AB  - When we are fatigued, we feel that our performance is worse than when we are fresh. 
      Yet, for over 100 years, researchers have been unable to identify an objective, 
      behavioral measure that covaries with the subjective experience of fatigue. Previous 
      work suggests that the metrics of signal detection theory (SDT)-response bias 
      (criterion) and perceptual certainty (d')-may change as a function of fatigue, but 
      no work has yet been done to examine whether these metrics covary with fatigue. 
      Here, we investigated cognitive fatigue using SDT. We induced fatigue through 
      repetitive performance of the n-back working memory task, while functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) data was acquired. We also assessed cognitive fatigue at 
      intervals throughout. This enabled us to assess not only whether criterion and d' 
      covary with cognitive fatigue but also whether similar patterns of brain activation 
      underlie cognitive fatigue and SDT measures. Our results show that both criterion 
      and d' were correlated with changes in cognitive fatigue: as fatigue increased, 
      subjects became more conservative in their response bias and their perceptual 
      certainty declined. Furthermore, activation in the striatum of the basal ganglia was 
      also related to cognitive fatigue, criterion, and d'. These results suggest that SDT 
      measures represent an objective measure of cognitive fatigue. Additionally, the 
      overlap and difference in the fMRI results between cognitive fatigue and SDT 
      measures indicate that these measures are related while also separate. In sum, we 
      show the relevance of SDT measures in the understanding of fatigue, thus providing 
      researchers with a new set of tools with which to better understand the nature and 
      consequences of cognitive fatigue.

PG  - 2113-2127
LID - 10.1007/s00429-018-1612-6 [doi]
AB  - A hierarchical and modular organization is a central hypothesis in the current 
      primate model of auditory cortex (AC) but lacks validation in humans. Here we 
      investigated whether fMRI connectivity at rest and during active tasks is 
      informative of the functional organization of human AC. Identical pitch-varying 
      sounds were presented during a visual discrimination (i.e. no directed auditory 
      attention), pitch discrimination, and two versions of pitch n-back memory tasks. 
      Analysis based on fMRI connectivity at rest revealed a network structure consisting 
      of six modules in supratemporal plane (STP), temporal lobe, and inferior parietal 
      lobule (IPL) in both hemispheres. In line with the primate model, in which 
      higher-order regions have more longer-range connections than primary regions, areas 
      encircling the STP module showed the highest inter-modular connectivity. 
      Multivariate pattern analysis indicated significant connectivity differences between 
      the visual task and rest (driven by the presentation of sounds during the visual 
      task), between auditory and visual tasks, and between pitch discrimination and pitch 
      n-back tasks. Further analyses showed that these differences were particularly due 
      to connectivity modulations between the STP and IPL modules. While the results are 
      generally in line with the primate model, they highlight the important role of human 
      IPL during the processing of both task-irrelevant and task-relevant auditory 
      information. Importantly, the present study shows that fMRI connectivity at rest, 
      during presentation of sounds, and during active listening provides novel 
      information about the functional organization of human AC.

TI  - Greater BOLD Variability is Associated With Poorer Cognitive Function in an Adult 
      Lifespan Sample.

AB  - Moment-to-moment fluctuations in brain signal assessed by functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) variability is 
      increasingly thought to represent important "signal" rather than measurement-related 
      "noise." Efforts to characterize BOLD variability in healthy aging have yielded 
      mixed outcomes, demonstrating both age-related increases and decreases in BOLD 
      variability and both detrimental and beneficial associations. Utilizing BOLD 
      mean-squared-successive-differences (MSSD) during a digit n-back working memory (WM) 
      task in a sample of healthy adults (aged 20-94 years; n = 171), we examined effects 
      of aging on whole-brain 1) BOLD variability during task (mean condition MSSD across 
      0-2-3-4 back conditions), 2) BOLD variability modulation to incrementally increasing 
      WM difficulty (linear slope from 0-2-3-4 back), and 3) the association of 
      age-related differences in variability with in- and out-of-scanner WM performance. 
      Widespread cortical and subcortical regions evidenced increased mean variability 
      with increasing age, with no regions evidencing age-related decrease in variability. 
      Additionally, posterior cingulate/precuneus exhibited increased variability to WM 
      difficulty. Notably, both age-related increases in BOLD variability were associated 
      with significantly poorer WM performance in all but the oldest adults. These 
      findings lend support to the growing corpus suggesting that brain-signal variability 
      is altered in healthy aging; specifically, in this adult lifespan sample, 
      BOLD-variability increased with age and was detrimental to cognitive performance.

AB  - This article describes the public neuroimaging dataset entitled "Working Memory and 
      Reward in Children with and without Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)" 
      available on OpenNeuro.org. This dataset uses functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) while participants complete 8 n-back tasks designed to explore working 
      memory, monetary reward, and feedback processing in typically developing children 
      and children diagnosed with ADHD. In addition, this dataset includes longitudinal 
      scores from a battery of standardized measures of cognitive ability, ADHD symptoms, 
      and reading skill. Neuroimaging and standardized testing data were collected from 79 
      children, aged 8.6-12.0, of which 35 had a formal diagnosis of ADHD at session T1. 
      48 children returned two years later to complete standardized testing at session T2. 
      Although some work has been published on the spatial working memory task, future 
      research could investigate the verbal working memory and longitudinal data which are 
      unexplored. In addition, this dataset is accompanied by an adult dataset, including 
      24 participants completing the same tasks entitled, "Working Memory and Reward in 
      Adults" and available on OpenNeuro.org.

TI  - Assessing working memory via N-back task in euthymic bipolar I disorder patients: a 
      review of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies.
PG  - 63-70
LID - 10.1159/000352011 [doi]
AB  - Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic and highly disabling mood disorder, associated 
      with the highest suicide rate among psychiatric disorders. Even though 
      neurobiological bases of BD have still to be further elucidated, recent neuroimaging 
      studies provided compelling evidence about functional correlates of cognitive 
      deficits in BD patients, with working memory (WM) impairment being one of the most 
      commonly reported findings. Such dysfunctions are likely to persist beyond acute 
      phases of the illness, so they qualify as endophenotypic markers for the disorder. 
      This review sought to synthesize, through a MEDLINE search up to December 2012, 
      published functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies on WM networks, 
      conducted through N-back task in euthymic BD I patients and including a control 
      comparison group. Eight studies meeting the search criteria were identified. Despite 
      heterogeneity across findings, particularly in relation to task performance (i.e. 
      accuracy and reaction time), most studies reported a loss of connectivity in BD 
      patients' prefrontal networks, traditionally involved in WM, as well as patterns of 
      abnormal activation in the dorso/ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, other prefrontal 
      areas and the parietal and temporal cortex. These findings suggest the involvement 
      of intact secondary systems in order to overcome lack of integrity across WM 
      circuits in BD patients. Further investigation in the field is warranted.

TI  - Mapping of the Underlying Neural Mechanisms of Maintenance and Manipulation in 
      Visuo-Spatial Working Memory Using An n-back Mental Rotation Task: A Functional 
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study.
PG  - 87

LID - 87
AB  - Mapping of the underlying neural mechanisms of visuo-spatial working memory (WM) has 
      been shown to consistently elicit activity in right hemisphere dominant 
      fronto-parietal networks. However to date, the bulk of neuroimaging literature has 
      focused largely on the maintenance aspect of visuo-spatial WM, with a scarcity of 
      research into the aspects of WM involving manipulation of information. Thus, this 
      study aimed to compare maintenance-only with maintenance and manipulation of 
      visuo-spatial stimuli (3D cube shapes) utilizing a 1-back task while functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were acquired. Sixteen healthy participants 
      (9 women, M = 23.94 years, SD = 2.49) were required to perform the 1-back task with 
      or without mentally rotating the shapes 90° on a vertical axis. When no rotation was 
      required (maintenance-only condition), a right hemispheric lateralization was 
      revealed across fronto-parietal areas. However, when the task involved maintaining 
      and manipulating the same stimuli through 90° rotation, activation was primarily 
      seen in the bilateral parietal lobe and left fusiform gyrus. The findings confirm 
      that the well-established right lateralized fronto-parietal networks are likely to 
      underlie simple maintenance of visuo-spatial stimuli. The results also suggest that 
      the added demand of manipulation of information maintained online appears to require 
      further neural recruitment of functionally related areas. In particular mental 
      rotation of visuospatial stimuli required bilateral parietal areas, and the left 
      fusiform gyrus potentially to maintain a categorical or object representation. It 
      can be concluded that WM is a complex neural process involving the interaction of an 
      increasingly large network.

AB  - Although fluctuations in sustained attention are ubiquitous, most psychological 
      experiments treat them as noise, averaging performance over many trials. The current 
      study uses multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to decode whether, on each trial of a 
      cognitive task, participants are in an optimal or suboptimal attentional state. 
      During fMRI, participants performed n-back tasks, composed of central face images 
      overlaid on distractor scenes, with low, perceptual, and working memory load. 
      Instructions were to respond to novel faces and withhold response to rare repeats. 
      To index attentional state, reaction time variability was calculated at each correct 
      response. Participants' 50% least variable trials were labeled optimal, or "in the 
      zone," and their 50% most erratic trials were labeled suboptimal, or "out of the 
      zone." Support vector machine classifiers trained on activity in the default mode 
      network (DMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), and task-relevant fusiform face area 
      (FFA) distinguished in-the-zone and out-of-the-zone trials in all tasks. Consistent 
      with evidence that distractors are processed when central task load is low, 
      parahippocampal place area (PPA) classifiers were only successful in the low load 
      task. Classification in anatomical regions across the brain revealed widespread 
      coding of attentional state. In contrast to these robust pattern analyses, 
      univariate signal in DMN, DAN, FFA, and PPA did not distinguish states, suggesting a 
      nuanced relationship to sustained attention. In sum, MVPA can be used to decode 
      trial-by-trial attentional state throughout much of cortex, helping to characterize 
      how attention network fluctuations correlate with performance variability.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that the gene encoding the adhesion G protein-coupled 
      receptor L3 (ADGRL3; formerly latrophilin 3, LPHN3) is associated with 
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Conversely, no studies have 
      investigated the anatomical or functional brain substrates of ADGRL3 risk variants. 
      We examined here whether individuals with different ADGRL3 haplotypes, including 
      both patients with ADHD and healthy controls, showed differences in brain anatomy 
      and function. We recruited and genotyped adult patients with combined type ADHD and 
      healthy controls to achieve a sample balanced for age, sex, premorbid IQ, and three 
      ADGRL3 haplotype groups (risk, protective, and others). The final sample (n = 128) 
      underwent structural and functional brain imaging (voxel-based morphometry and 
      n-back working memory fMRI). We analyzed the brain structural and functional effects 
      of ADHD, haplotypes, and their interaction, covarying for age, sex, and medication. 
      Individuals (patients or controls) with the protective haplotype showed strong, 
      widespread hypo-activation in the frontal cortex extending to inferior temporal and 
      fusiform gyri. Individuals (patients or controls) with the risk haplotype also 
      showed hypo-activation, more focused in the right temporal cortex. Patients showed 
      parietal hyper-activation. Disorder-haplotype interactions, as well as structural 
      findings, were not statistically significant. To sum up, both protective and risk 
      ADGRL3 haplotypes are associated with substantial brain hypo-activation during 
      working memory tasks, stressing this gene's relevance in cognitive brain function. 
      Conversely, we did not find brain effects of the interactions between adult ADHD and 
      ADGRL3 haplotypes.

TI  - Brain functional correlates of formal thought disorder in schizophrenia: examining 
      the frontal/dysexecutive hypothesis.
PG  - 2446-2453
LID - 10.1017/S0033291720001063 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: One hypothesis proposed to underlie formal thought disorder (FTD), the 
      incoherent speech is seen in some patients with schizophrenia, is that it reflects 
      impairment in frontal/executive function. While this proposal has received support 
      in neuropsychological studies, it has been relatively little tested using functional 
      imaging. This study aimed to examine brain activations associated with FTD, and its 
      two main factor-analytically derived subsyndromes, during the performance of a 
      working memory task. METHODS: Seventy patients with schizophrenia showing a full 
      range of FTD scores and 70 matched healthy controls underwent fMRI during the 
      performance of the 2-back version of the n-back task. Whole-brain corrected, 
      voxel-based correlations with FTD scores were examined in the patient group. 
      RESULTS: During 2-back performance the patients showed clusters of significant 
      inverse correlation with FTD scores in the inferior frontal cortex and dorsolateral 
      prefrontal cortex bilaterally, the left temporal cortex and subcortically in the 
      basal ganglia and thalamus. Further analysis revealed that these correlations 
      reflected an association only with 'alogia' (poverty of speech, poverty of content 
      of speech and perseveration) and not with the 'fluent disorganization' component of 
      FTD. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides functional imaging support for the view that 
      FTD in schizophrenia may involve impaired executive/frontal function. However, the 
      relationship appears to be exclusively with alogia and not with the variables 
      contributing to fluent disorganization.

TI  - Imbalance Between Prefronto-Thalamic and Sensorimotor-Thalamic Circuitries 
      Associated with Working Memory Deficit in Schizophrenia.
PG  - 251-261
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbab086 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thalamocortical circuit imbalance characterized by prefronto-thalamic 
      hypoconnectivity and sensorimotor-thalamic hyperconnectivity has been consistently 
      documented at rest in schizophrenia (SCZ). However, this thalamocortical imbalance 
      has not been studied during task engagement to date, limiting our understanding of 
      its role in cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. METHODS: Both n-back working 
      memory (WM) task-fMRI and resting-state fMRI data were collected from 172 patients 
      with SCZ and 103 healthy control subjects (HC). A replication sample with 49 SCZ and 
      48 HC was independently obtained. Sixteen thalamic subdivisions were employed as 
      seeds for the analysis. RESULTS: During both task-performance and rest, SCZ showed 
      thalamic hyperconnectivity with sensorimotor cortices, but hypoconnectivity with 
      prefrontal-cerebellar regions relative to controls. Higher sensorimotor-thalamic 
      connectivity and lower prefronto-thalamic connectivity both relate to poorer WM 
      performance (lower task accuracy and longer response time) and difficulties in 
      discriminating target from nontarget (lower d' score) in n-back task. The 
      prefronto-thalamic hypoconnectivity and sensorimotor-thalamic hyperconnectivity were 
      anti-correlated both in SCZ and HCs; this anti-correlation was more pronounced with 
      less cognitive demand (rest>0-back>2-back). These findings replicated well in the 
      second sample. Finally, the hypo- and hyper-connectivity patterns during 
      resting-state positively correlated with the hypo- and hyper-connectivity during 
      2-back task-state in SCZ respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The thalamocortical imbalance 
      reflected by prefronto-thalamic hypoconnectivity and sensorimotor-thalamic 
      hyperconnectivity is present both at rest and during task engagement in SCZ and 
      relates to working memory performance. The frontal reduction, sensorimotor 
      enhancement pattern of thalamocortical imbalance is a state-invariant feature of SCZ 
      that affects a core cognitive function.

TI  - Spatial working memory dysfunction in minimal hepatic encephalopathy: an ethology 
      and BOLD-fMRI study.
PG  - 62-72
LID - 10.1016/j.brainres.2012.01.036 [doi]
AB  - The term "minimal hepatic encephalopathy" (MHE) refers to a population of 
      individuals who have no recognizable clinical symptoms but perform abnormally on 
      neuropsychological and neurophysiological tests. Research shows that MHE patients 
      have impairments in cognition affecting their daily lives that should be treated. 
      This study explored the neural basis of spatial working memory impairment in MHE 
      patients using behavioral test and BOLD-fMRI. Twelve normal controls, twelve 
      cirrhosis patients without MHE and twelve MHE patients took part. The memory 
      quotient of the MHE group (Wechsler Memory Scale-Chinese revised: WMS-CR) was lower 
      than the normal control group and the cirrhosis-without-MHE group, and primarily 
      concerned short-term memory and transient memory. Performance accuracy was lower for 
      the MHE group than the control group and the cirrhosis-without-MHE group, and mean 
      reaction time was prolonged. The fMRI data highlighted a neural network consisting 
      of: bilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), bilateral premotor area (PreMA), 
      supplementary motor area (SMA) and bilateral parietal areas (PA), which was 
      activated in the n-back task. The load effect of BOLD-fMRI response appeared in all 
      regions of interest (ROI) for the normal control group, but only appeared in PreMA 
      and PA, and did not vary with n-back load in PFC or SMA for the MHE group. 
      Activation intensities for all ROIs were higher for the normal control group than 
      the MHE group, especially in 2-back load. In conclusion, these results demonstrate 
      that MHE patients have debilitated spatial working memory, and that impairments of 
      bilateral PFC, PMA, SMA, and PA commonly lead to spatial working memory dysfunction. 
      Furthermore, PFC impairment may form the neural basis of spatial working memory 
      impairment.

TI  - Working Memory-Related Effective Connectivity in Huntington's Disease Patients.
PG  - 370

LID - 370
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetically caused neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by heterogeneous motor, psychiatric, and cognitive symptoms. Although 
      motor symptoms may be the most prominent presentation, cognitive symptoms such as 
      memory deficits and executive dysfunction typically co-occur. We used functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and task fMRI-based dynamic causal modeling (DCM) 
      to evaluate HD-related changes in the neural network underlying working memory (WM). 
      Sixty-four pre-symptomatic HD mutation carriers (preHD), 20 patients with early 
      manifest HD symptoms (earlyHD), and 83 healthy control subjects performed an n-back 
      fMRI task with two levels of WM load. Effective connectivity was assessed in five 
      predefined regions of interest, comprising bilateral inferior parietal cortex, left 
      anterior cingulate cortex, and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. HD mutation 
      carriers performed less accurately and more slowly at high WM load compared with the 
      control group. While between-group comparisons of brain activation did not reveal 
      differential recruitment of the cortical WM network in mutation carriers, 
      comparisons of brain connectivity as identified with DCM revealed a number of group 
      differences across the whole WM network. Most strikingly, we observed decreasing 
      connectivity from several regions toward right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
      (rDLPFC) in preHD and even more so in earlyHD. The deterioration in rDLPFC 
      connectivity complements results from previous studies and might mirror beginning 
      cortical neural decline at premanifest and early manifest stages of HD. We were able 
      to characterize effective connectivity in a WM network of HD mutation carriers 
      yielding further insight into patterns of cognitive decline and accompanying neural 
      deterioration.

TI  - n-back task performance and corresponding brain-activation patterns in women with

AB  - Eating disorder (ED) variants characterized by "binge-eating/purging" symptoms 
      differ from "restricting-only" variants along diverse clinical dimensions, but few 
      studies have compared people with these different eating-disorder phenotypes on 
      measures of neurocognitive function and brain activation. We tested the performances 
      of 19 women with "restricting-only" eating syndromes and 27 with 
      "binge-eating/purging" variants on a modified n-back task, and used functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine task-induced brain activations in 
      frontal regions of interest. When compared with "binge-eating/purging" participants, 
      "restricting-only" participants showed superior performance. Furthermore, in an 
      intermediate-demand condition, "binge-eating/purging" participants showed 
      significantly less event-related activation than did "restricting-only" participants 
      in a right posterior prefrontal region spanning Brodmann areas 6-8-a region that has 
      been linked to planning of motor responses, working memory for sequential 
      information, and management of uncertainty. Our findings suggest that working memory 
      is poorer in eating-disordered individuals with binge-eating/purging behaviors than 
      in those who solely restrict food intake, and that observed performance differences 
      coincide with interpretable group-based activation differences in a frontal region 
      thought to subserve planning and decision making.

TI  - Cognitive Performance, Aerobic Fitness, Motor Proficiency, and Brain Function Among 
      Children Newly Diagnosed With Craniopharyngioma.
PG  - 413-425
LID - 10.1017/S1355617718001170 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Craniopharyngioma survivors experience cognitive deficits that 
      negatively impact quality of life. Aerobic fitness is associated with cognitive 
      benefits in typically developing children and physical exercise promotes recovery 
      following brain injury. Accordingly, we investigated cognitive and neural correlates 
      of aerobic fitness in a sample of craniopharyngioma patients. METHODS: Patients 
      treated for craniopharyngioma [N=104, 10.0±4.6 years, 48% male] participated in 
      fitness, cognitive and fMRI (n=51) assessments following surgery but before proton 
      radiation therapy. RESULTS: Patients demonstrated impaired aerobic fitness [peak 
      oxygen uptake (PKVO2)=23.9±7.1, 41% impaired (i.e., 1.5 SD&lt;normative mean)], 
      motor proficiency [Bruininks-Oseretsky (BOT2)=38.6±9.0, 28% impaired], and executive 
      functions (e.g., WISC-IV Working Memory Index (WMI)=96.0±15.3, 11% impaired). PKVO2 
      correlated with better executive functions (e.g., WISC-IV WMI r=.27, p=.02) and 
      academic performance (WJ-III Calculation r=.24, p=.04). BOT2 correlated with better 
      attention (e.g., CPT-II omissions r=.26, p=.04) and executive functions (e.g., 
      WISC-IV WMI r=.32, p=.01). Areas of robust neural activation during an n-back task 
      included superior parietal lobule, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and middle and 
      superior frontal gyri (p&lt;.05, corrected). Higher network activation was 
      associated with better working memory task performance and better BOT2 (p&lt;.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Before adjuvant therapy, children with craniopharyngioma demonstrate 
      significantly reduced aerobic fitness, motor proficiency, and working memory. Better 
      aerobic fitness and motor proficiency are associated with better attention and 
      executive functions, as well as greater activation of a well-established working 
      memory network. These findings may help explain differential risk/resiliency with 
      respect to acute cognitive changes that may portend cognitive late effects. (JINS, 
      2019, 25, 413-425).

PG  - 51-9
LID - 10.3109/00207450903275129 [doi]
AB  - Dyslexia is a condition characterized by difficulty of reading given adequate 
      intelligence and educational opportunities, primarily associated with a phonological 
      processing deficit. In this study we show that dyslexic children also show a deficit 
      in working memory compared to a control group, measured with fMRI. A working memory 
      n-back task with three load levels was used. Behavioral data showed that the 
      dyslexics had poorer performance compared to the controls. fMRI data showed that the 
      dyslexics had reduced activation in the prefrontal and parietal cortices and the 
      cerebellum compared with the controls. These results imply a working memory deficit 
      in dyslexia.

AB  - Sex steroid hormones and neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic 
      factor (BDNF), play a significant neuroprotective role in memory circuitry aging. 
      Here, we present findings characterizing the neuroprotective effects of BDNF on 
      memory performance, as a function of sex and reproductive status in women. 
      Participants (N = 191; mean age = 50.03 ± 2.10) underwent clinical and cognitive 
      testing, fMRI scanning, and hormonal assessments of menopausal staging. Memory 
      performance was assessed with the 6-Trial Selective Reminding Test and the Face-Name 
      Associative Memory Exam. Participants also performed a working memory (WM) N-back 
      task during fMRI scanning. Results revealed significant interactions between 
      menopausal status and BDNF levels. Only in postmenopausal women, lower plasma BDNF 
      levels were associated with significantly worse memory performance and altered 
      function in the WM circuitry. BDNF had no significant impact on memory performance 
      or WM function in pre/perimenopausal women or men. These results suggest that in 
      postmenopausal women, BDNF is associated with memory performance and memory 
      circuitry function, thus providing evidence of potential sex-dependent factors of 
      risk and resilience for early intervention.

TI  - Feasibility and Findings from a Novel Working Memory fMRI Paradigm in Multiple 
      Sclerosis.
PG  - 1011
AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional MRI (fMRI) basic cognitive paradigms such as the n-back have 
      been shown to detect cognitive impairment (CI) in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The 
      immediate memory task/delayed memory task (IMT/DMT) detects varying degrees of 
      working memory (WM) by alternating three levels of complexity and two levels of WM 
      delay. This paradigm has not been evaluated in MS nor validated against standard 
      neuropsychological (NP) testing. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the correlation between WM 
      function and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activation on fMRI in MS patients 
      undergoing the IMT/DMT. To compare IMT/DMT behavioral scores to NP scores. METHODS: 
      10 MS patients with no history of CI underwent the Minimal Assessment of Cognitive 
      Function in MS (MACFIMS) and an fMRI session where they performed the IMT/DMT. 
      Working-memory ("wmem") activation was defined as the BOLD signal during DMT blocks 
      for a particular condition (3, 5, or 7 digits per stimuli) minus the BOLD signal 
      during IMT blocks for that condition. Areas of statistically significant Family Wise 
      Error (FWE) -corrected cluster-level BOLD activation were identified using SPM8 
      Random Effects t-test. IMT/DMT behavioral data and MACFIMS scores were compared. 
      RESULTS: The 3-digit as well as the 5-digit wmem showed significant fMRI BOLD 
      activation. The 3-digit wmem, activation was found in portions of the bilateral 
      superior and mid frontal cortex, supplementary motor area, pre and post central 
      gyrus, bilateral superior and inferior parietal lobule, inferolateral pre-frontal 
      cortex, cuneus, insula and cingulate regions. The 5 digit wmen activation was seen 
      in the inferior medial frontal and medial orbitofrontal cortex. IMT/DMT behavioral 
      scores were within normal range and consistent with MACFIMS. CONCLUSION: IMT/DMT, a 
      novel fMRI working memory paradigm, is associated with BOLD activation in areas of 
      the brain related to cognitive function in patients with MS. Both MACFIMS and 
      IMT/DMT scores were in agreement and supported intact cognitive function.

TI  - Change in prefrontal activity and executive functions after action-based cognitive 
      remediation in bipolar disorder: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1113-1121
LID - 10.1038/s41386-020-00901-7 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive impairment is prevalent in bipolar disorder (BD) but treatments with 
      pro-cognitive effects are lacking. Insight concerning the neurocircuitry of 
      cognitive improvement could provide a biomarker for pro-cognitive effects to advance 
      treatment development. The dorsal prefrontal cortex (dPFC) is a promising region for 
      such treatment target engagement. The aim of this functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) study was to examine the effects of action-based cognitive 
      remediation (ABCR) on early change in the dPFC blood-oxygen-level-dependent response 
      in patients with BD in remission, and whether the observed neural change predicted 
      improved executive functions following 10 weeks of treatment. Forty-five 
      participants with remitted BD (ABCR: n = 26, control treatment: n = 19) completed a 
      spatial n-back working memory task during fMRI and executive function tasks outside 
      the scanner before and after two weeks of ABCR/control treatment, and an additional 
      assessment of executive function at treatment completion. Thirty-four healthy 
      controls underwent a single fMRI and executive function assessment for baseline 
      comparisons. We found an early reversal of pretreatment hypo-activity in the 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) following ABCR vs. control during both 
      high-load (2-back > 1-back) working memory (WM) (F(1,43) = 5.69, p = 0.02, 
      η(2) = 0.12) and general WM (2-back > 0-back) (F(1,43) = 5.61, p = 0.02, 
      η(2) = 0.12). This dlPFC activity increase predicted improved executive functions at 
      treatment completion (high-load WM: B = -0.45, p = 0.01, general WM: B = -0.41, 
      p < 0.01), independent of changes in subsyndromal symptoms. In conclusion, early 
      dPFC increase may provide a neurocircuitry-based biomarker for pro-cognitive 
      effects. Future cognition trials should include fMRI assessments to confirm the 
      validity of this putative biomarker model across disorders with cognitive 
      impairment.

AB  - The growth of functional MRI has led to development of human brain atlases derived 
      by parcellating resting-state connectivity patterns into functionally independent 
      regions of interest (ROIs). All functional atlases to date have been derived from 
      resting-state fMRI data. But given that functional connectivity between regions 
      varies with task, we hypothesized that an atlas incorporating both resting-state and 
      task-based fMRI data would produce an atlas with finer characterization of 
      task-relevant regions than an atlas derived from resting-state alone. To test this 
      hypothesis, we derived parcellation atlases from twenty-nine healthy adult 
      participants enrolled in the Cognitive Connectome project, an initiative to improve 
      functional MRI's translation into clinical decision-making by mapping normative 
      variance in brain-behavior relationships. Participants underwent resting-state and 
      task-based fMRI spanning nine cognitive domains: motor, visuospatial, attention, 
      language, memory, affective processing, decision-making, working memory, and 
      executive function. Spatially constrained n-cut parcellation derived brain atlases 
      using (1) all participants' functional data (Task) or (2) a single resting-state 
      scan (Rest). An atlas was also derived from random parcellation for comparison 
      purposes (Random). Two methods were compared: (1) a parcellation applied to the 
      group's mean edge weights (mean), and (2) a two-stage approach with parcellation of 
      individual edge weights followed by parcellation of mean binarized edges 
      (two-stage). The resulting Task and Rest atlases had significantly greater 
      similarity with each other (mean Jaccard indices JI=0.72-0.85) than with the Random 
      atlases (JI=0.59-0.63; all p<0.001 after Bonferroni correction). Task and Rest atlas 
      similarity was greatest for the two-stage method (JI=0.85), which has been shown as 
      more robust than the mean method; these atlases also better reproduced voxelwise 
      seed maps of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during rest and performing the 
      n-back working memory task (r=0.75-0.80) than the Random atlases (r=0.64-0.72), 
      further validating their utility. We expected regions governing higher-order 
      cognition (such as frontal and anterior temporal lobes) to show greatest difference 
      between Task and Rest atlases; contrary to expectations, these areas had greatest 
      similarity between atlases. Our findings indicate that atlases derived from 
      parcellation of task-based and resting-state fMRI data are highly comparable, and 
      existing resting-state atlases are suitable for task-based analyses. We introduce an 
      anatomically labeled fMRI-derived whole-brain human atlas for future Cognitive 
      Connectome analyses.

AB  - The current study examined the effects of an 11-week exercise intervention on brain 
      activity during a working memory (WM) task and resting-state functional network 
      connectivity in deaf children. Twenty-six deaf children were randomly assigned to 
      either an 11-week exercise intervention or control conditions. Before and after the 
      exercise intervention, all participants were scanned with functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) during N-back task performance and a resting state. The 
      behavioural results showed that the exercise intervention improved WM performance. 
      Task activation analyses showed an increase in the parietal, occipital, and temporal 
      gyri and hippocampus and hippocampus (HIP). In addition, WM performance improvements 
      were associated with greater activation in the left HIP region. Resting-state 
      functional connectivity (Rs-FC) between HIP and certain other brain areas shown a 
      significant interaction of group (exercise versus no exercise) and time (pre- and 
      postintervention). Moreover, connectivity between the left HIP and left middle 
      frontal gyrus was related to improved WM performance. These data extend current 
      knowledge by indicating that an exercise intervention can improve WM in deaf 
      children, and these enhancements may be related to the WM network plasticity changes 
      induced by exercise.

AB  - The development of treatments for attention impairments is hampered by limited 
      knowledge about the malleability of underlying neural functions. We conducted the 
      first randomized controlled trial to determine the modulations of brain activity 
      associated with working memory (WM) training in adults with attention-deficit 
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). At baseline, we assessed the aberrant functional 
      brain activity in the n-back WM task by comparing 44 adults with ADHD with 18 
      healthy controls using fMRI. Participants with ADHD were then randomized to train on 
      an adaptive dual n-back task or an active control task. We tested whether WM 
      training elicits redistribution of brain activity as observed in healthy controls, 
      and whether it might further restore aberrant activity related to ADHD. As expected, 
      activity in areas of the default-mode (DMN), salience (SN), sensory-motor (SMN), 
      frontoparietal (FPN), and subcortical (SCN) networks was decreased in participants 
      with ADHD at pretest as compared with healthy controls, especially when the 
      cognitive load was high. WM training modulated widespread FPN and SN areas, 
      restoring some of the aberrant activity. Training effects were mainly observed as 
      decreased brain activity during the trained task and increased activity during the 
      untrained task, suggesting different neural mechanisms for trained and transfer 
      tasks.

TI  - Working memory network dysfunction in relapse-onset multiple sclerosis phenotypes: A 
      clinical-imaging evaluation.
PG  - 577-587
LID - 10.1177/1352458516656809 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We investigated clinical, behavioural and functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) correlates of working memory load in relapse-onset multiple sclerosis 
      (MS) patients. METHODS: In total, 12 clinically isolated syndromes (CIS) patients at 
      risk of MS, 38 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), 22 secondary 
      progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) and 24 healthy controls (HC) performed an 
      N-back fMRI task. Correlations between fMRI abnormalities and clinico-behavioural 
      and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures were assessed. RESULTS: 
      Participants activated brain regions of the working memory network, especially in 
      fronto-parietal lobes and cerebellum, and deactivated areas of the default mode 
      network (DMN). During the N-back load contrast, compared to HC, the three groups of 
      MS patients had a common pattern of decreased activation of the right superior 
      parietal lobule, left inferior parietal lobule and left middle frontal gyrus. Areas 
      specifically more active in CIS patients compared to the other study groups were 
      found in the left medial superior frontal gyrus and right anterior cingulate cortex, 
      whereas SPMS patients selectively activated the left parahippocampal gyrus and left 
      superior temporal pole (STP). Worse accuracy and global cognitive scores correlated 
      with increased STP activation. CONCLUSION: Load-dependent alterations of working 
      memory network recruitment occur in MS. Frontal hyperactivation is maintained in CIS 
      and lost in SPMS. Abnormal recruitment of DMN areas is related to worse cognitive 
      and behavioural outcomes.

TI  - A cognitive fMRI study in non-manifesting LRRK2 and GBA carriers.
PG  - 1207-1218

AB  - Mutations in the GBA and LRRK2 genes account for one-third of the prevalence of 
      Parkinson's disease (PD) in Ashkenazi Jews. Non-manifesting carriers (NMC) of these 
      mutations represent a population at risk for future development of PD. PD patient 
      who carry mutations in the GBA gene demonstrates more significant cognitive decline 
      compared to idiopathic PD patients. We assessed cognitive domains using fMRI among 
      NMC of both LRRK2 and GBA mutations to better understand pre-motor cognitive 
      functions in these populations. Twenty-one LRRK2-NMC, 10 GBA-NMC, and 22 
      non-manifesting non-carriers (NMNC) who participated in this study were evaluated 
      using the standard questionnaires and scanned while performing two separate 
      cognitive tasks; a Stroop interference task and an N-Back working memory task. 
      Cerebral activation patterns were assessed using both whole brain and predefined 
      region of interest (ROI) analysis. Subjects were well matched in all demographic and 
      clinical characteristics. On the Stroop task, in spite of similar behavior, GBA-NMC 
      demonstrated increased task-related activity in the right medial frontal gyrus and 
      reduced task-related activity in the left lingual gyrus compared to both LRRK2-NMC 
      and NMNC. In addition, GBA-NMC had higher activation patterns in the incongruent 
      task compared to NMNC in the left medial frontal gyrus and bilateral precentral 
      gyrus. No whole-brain differences were noted between groups on the N-Back task. 
      Paired cognitive and task-related performance between GBA-NMC, LRRK2-NMC, and NMNC 
      could indicate that the higher activation patterns in the incongruent Stroop 
      condition among GBA-NMC compared to LRRK2-NMC and NMNC may represent a compensatory 
      mechanism that enables adequate cognitive performance.

AB  - Stress has been proposed to affect cognitive control capacities, including working 
      memory (WM) maintenance. This effect may depend on variability in stress reactivity 
      and past subjective stress. However, as most studies employed between-subjects 
      designs, evidence for within-subject stress effects remains scarce. To understand 
      the role of intra-individual stress effects on WM, we adopted a within-subject 
      design to study how acute stress, variability in stress reactivity, and past 
      subjective stress influence behavioral and neural WM mechanisms. Thirty-four healthy 
      males performed a WM task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a 
      control versus acute stress condition following the Trier Social Stress Test, a 
      validated psychosocial stressor method. We tested for stress effects on WM 
      performance and related neural activation by associating them with individual acute 
      stress responsivity and past subjective stress experience using retrospective 
      self-report questionnaires. We found no evidence of an effect of acute stress or 
      related stress-reactivity on intra-individual WM performance. However, past 
      subjective stress negatively influenced acute stress-induced changes to WM. On the 
      neural level, acute stress reduced WM-related activation in the dorsolateral 
      prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). The observed negative influence of inter-individual 
      variability in past subjective stress experience on changes in WM performance, 
      suggests that past subjective stress might induce vulnerability for impairing 
      effects of acute stress on cognitive functioning. Because acute stress reduced 
      WM-related dlPFC activation while WM performance remained unaffected, acute stress 
      might boost neural processing efficiency in this group of high performing healthy 
      individuals. Our study suggests that measures of past subjective stress should be 
      considered when studying and interpreting the effects of acute stress on cognition.

TI  - Brain bases of recovery following cognitive rehabilitation for traumatic brain 
      injury: a preliminary study.
PG  - 410-420
LID - 10.1007/s11682-020-00269-8 [doi]
AB  - Many patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) have persistent cognitive deficits, 
      including decreased attention and working memory. This preliminary study examined 
      fMRI data from a clinical trial implementing a 4-week virtual reality driving 
      intervention to assess how sustained training can improve deficits related to 
      traumatic brain injury. Previously-reported behavioral findings showed improvements 
      in working memory and processing speed in those who received the intervention; this 
      report explores the brain bases of these effects by comparing neural activity 
      related to working memory (n-back task) and resting state connectivity before and 
      after the intervention. In the baseline visit (n = 24), working memory activity was 
      prominent in bilateral DLPFC and prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, medial superior 
      frontal gyrus, left thalamus, bilateral supramarginal / angular gyrus, precuneus, 
      and left posterior middle temporal gyrus. Following intervention, participants 
      showed less global activation on the n-back task, with regions of activity only in 
      the bilateral middle frontal cortex, posterior middle frontal gyrus, and 
      supramarginal gyrus. Activity related to working memory load was reduced for the 
      group that went through the intervention (n = 7) compared to the waitlist control 
      group (n = 4). These results suggest that successful cognitive rehabilitation of 
      working memory in TBI may be associated with increased efficiency of brain networks, 
      evidenced by reduced activation of brain activity during cognitive processing. These 
      results highlight the importance of examining brain activity related to cognitive 
      rehabilitation of attention and working memory after brain injury.

AB  - The increasing availability of high temporal resolution neuroimaging data has 
      increased the efforts to understand the dynamics of neural functions. Until 
      recently, there are few studies on generative models supporting classification and 
      prediction of neural systems compared to the description of the architecture. 
      However, the requirement of collapsing data spatially and temporally in the 
      state-of-the art methods to analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data cause loss of 
      important information. In this study, we addressed this issue using a topological 
      data analysis (TDA) method, called Mapper, which visualizes evolving patterns of 
      brain activity as a mathematical graph. Accordingly, we analyzed preprocessed MEG 
      data of 83 subjects from Human Connectome Project (HCP) collected during working 
      memory n-back task. We examined variation in the dynamics of the brain states with 
      the Mapper graphs, and to determine how this variation relates to measures such as 
      response time and performance. The application of the Mapper method to MEG data 
      detected a novel neuroimaging marker that explained the performance of the 
      participants along with the ground truth of response time. In addition, TDA enabled 
      us to distinguish two task-positive brain activations during 0-back and 2-back 
      tasks, which is hard to detect with the other pipelines that require collapsing the 
      data in the spatial and temporal domain. Further, the Mapper graphs of the 
      individuals also revealed one large group in the middle of the stimulus detecting 
      the high engagement in the brain with fine temporal resolution, which could 
      contribute to increase spatiotemporal resolution by merging different imaging 
      modalities. Hence, our work provides another evidence to the effectiveness of the 
      TDA methods for extracting subtle dynamic properties of high temporal resolution MEG 
      data without the temporal and spatial collapse.

AB  - The verbal identity n-back task is commonly used to assess verbal working memory 
      (VWM) capacity. Only three studies have compared brain activation during the n-back 
      when using auditory and visual stimuli. The earliest study, a positron emission 
      tomography study of the 3-back, found no differences in VWM-related brain activation 
      between n-back modalities. In contrast, two subsequent functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) studies of the 2-back found that auditory VWM was associated with 
      greater left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DL-PFC) activation than visual VWM, 
      perhaps suggesting that auditory VWM requires more cognitive effort than its visual 
      counterpart. The current study aimed to assess whether DL-PFC activation (i.e., 
      cognitive effort) differs by VWM modality. To do this, 16 younger adults completed 
      an auditory and visual n-back, both at four levels of VWM load. Concurrently, 
      activation of the PFC was measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy 
      (fNIRS), a silent neuroimaging method. We found that DL-PFC activation increased 
      with VWM load, but it was not affected by VWM modality or the interaction between 
      load and modality. This supports the view that both VWM modalities require similar 
      cognitive effort, and perhaps that previous fMRI results were an artefact of scanner 
      noise. We also found that, across conditions, DL-PFC activation was positively 
      correlated with reaction time. This may further support DL-PFC activation as an 
      index of cognitive effort, and fNIRS as a method to measure it.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Working memory is a critical cognitive ability that affects our daily 
      functioning and relates to many cognitive processes and clinical conditions. 
      Episodic memory is vital because it enables individuals to form and maintain their 
      self-identities. Our study analyzes the extent to which whole-brain functional 
      connectivity observed during completion of an N-back memory task, a common measure 
      of working memory, can predict both working memory and episodic memory. METHODS: We 
      used connectome-based predictive models (CPMs) to predict 502 Human Connectome 
      Project (HCP) participants' in-scanner 2-back memory test scores and out-of-scanner 
      working memory test (List Sorting) and episodic memory test (Picture Sequence and 
      Penn Word) scores based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data 
      collected both during rest and N-back task performance. We also analyzed the 
      functional brain connections that contributed to prediction for each of these 
      models. RESULTS: Functional connectivity observed during N-back task performance 
      predicted out-of-scanner List Sorting scores and to a lesser extent out-of-scanner 
      Picture Sequence scores, but did not predict out-of-scanner Penn Word scores. 
      Additionally, the functional connections predicting 2-back scores overlapped to a 
      greater degree with those predicting List Sorting scores than with those predicting 
      Picture Sequence or Penn Word scores. Functional connections with the insula, 
      including connections between insular and parietal regions, predicted scores across 
      the 2-back, List Sorting, and Picture Sequence tasks. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings 
      validate functional connectivity observed during the N-back task as a measure of 
      working memory, which generalizes to predict episodic memory to a lesser extent. By 
      building on our understanding of the predictive power of N-back task functional 
      connectivity, this work enhances our knowledge of relationships between working 
      memory and episodic memory.

AB  - Clinical remission of depression may be associated with emotional residual symptoms. 
      We studied the association of emotional blunting, rumination with neural networks 
      dynamics in remitted depressed patients and cognitive performance during an N-Back 
      task. Twenty-six outpatients in remission of depression (Hamilton Depressive rating 
      scale score <7) performed an N-Back task during fMRI assessment. All patients had 
      been treated by paroxetine for a minimum of 4 months. Two subgroups of patients 
      [Nonemotionally blunted (NEB) = 14 and emotionally blunted (EB) = 12] were 
      determined. To identify functional network maps across participants, the Network 
      Detection using Independent Component Analysis approach was employed. Within and 
      between Task Positive Network (TPN) and Default Mode Network (DMN) connectivity were 
      assessed and related to variability of performance on the N-Back task and 
      rumination. EB and NEB patients were not different for the level of accurate 
      responses at the N-Back. However over the entire working memory task, the negative 
      correlation between DMN and TPN was significantly lower in the EB than NEB group and 
      was differently related to cognitive performance and rumination. The stronger the 
      negative correlation between DMN and TPN was, the less variable the reaction time 
      during 3-Back task in NEB patients. Moreover the greater the negative correlation 
      between DMN and TPN was, the lower the rumination score in EB patients. Emotional 
      blunting may be associated with compromised monitoring of rumination and cognitive 
      functioning in remitted depressed patients through altered cooperation between DMN 
      and TPN. The study suggests clinical remission in depression is associated with 
      biological heterogeneity. Hum Brain Mapp 38:3491-3501, 2017. © 2017 Wiley

AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor insight in schizophrenia has been theorised to reflect a cognitive 
      deficit that is secondary to brain abnormalities, localized in the brain regions 
      that are implicated in higher order cognitive functions, including working memory 
      (WM). This study investigated WM-related neural substrates of preserved and poor 
      insight in schizophrenia. METHOD: Forty stable schizophrenia outpatients, 20 with 
      preserved and 20 with poor insight (usable data obtained from 18 preserved and 14 
      poor insight patients), and 20 healthy participants underwent functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) during a parametric 'n-back' task. The three groups were 
      preselected to match on age, education and predicted IQ, and the two patient groups 
      to have distinct insight levels. Performance and fMRI data were analysed to 
      determine how groups of patients with preserved and poor insight differed from each 
      other, and from healthy participants. RESULTS: Poor insight patients showed lower 
      performance accuracy, relative to healthy participants (p=0.01) and preserved 
      insight patients (p=0.08); the two patient groups were comparable on symptoms and 
      medication. Preserved insight patients, relative to poor insight patients, showed 
      greater activity most consistently in the precuneus and cerebellum (both bilateral) 
      during WM; they also showed greater activity than healthy participants in the 
      inferior-superior frontal gyrus and cerebellum (bilateral). Group differences in 
      brain activity did not co-vary significantly with performance accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The precuneus and cerebellum function contribute to preserved insight in 
      schizophrenia. Preserved insight as well as normal-range WM capacity in 
      schizophrenia sub-groups may be achieved via compensatory neural activity in the 
      frontal cortex and cerebellum.

TI  - Contributions of Brain Function and Structure to Three Different Domains of 
      Cognitive Control in Normal Aging.
PG  - 1811-1832
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_01685 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive control involves the flexible allocation of mental resources during 
      goal-directed behavior and comprises three correlated but distinct 
      domains-inhibition, shifting, and working memory. The work of Don Stuss and others 
      has demonstrated that frontal and parietal cortices are crucial to cognitive 
      control, particularly in normal aging, which is characterized by reduced control 
      mechanisms. However, the structure-function relationships specific to each domain 
      and subsequent impact on performance are not well understood. In the current study, 
      we examined both age and individual differences in functional activity associated 
      with core domains of cognitive control in relation to fronto-parietal structure and 
      task performance. Participants (n = 140, aged 20-86 years) completed three fMRI 
      tasks: go/no-go (inhibition), task switching (shifting), and n-back (working 
      memory), in addition to structural and diffusion imaging. All three tasks engaged a 
      common set of fronto-parietal regions; however, the contributions of age, brain 
      structure, and task performance to functional activity were unique to each domain. 
      Aging was associated with differences in functional activity for all tasks, largely 
      in regions outside common fronto-parietal control regions. Shifting and inhibition 
      showed greater contributions of structure to overall decreases in brain activity, 
      suggesting that more intact fronto-parietal structure may serve as a scaffold for 
      efficient functional response. Working memory showed no contribution of structure to 
      functional activity but had strong effects of age and task performance. Together, 
      these results provide a comprehensive and novel examination of the joint 
      contributions of aging, performance, and brain structure to functional activity 
      across multiple domains of cognitive control.

TI  - Relationships between dietary nutrients intake and lipid levels with functional MRI 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation.
PG  - 43-51
LID - 10.2147/CIA.S183425 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is a key node in the cognitive 
      control network that supports working memory. DLPFC dysfunction is related to 
      cognitive impairment. It has been suggested that dietary components and high-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) play a vital role in brain health and cognitive 
      function. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the relationships between dietary 
      nutrient intake and lipid levels with functional MRI (fMRI) brain activation in 
      DLPFC among older adults with mild cognitive impairment. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A 
      total of 15 community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment, aged ≥60 
      years, participated in this cross-sectional study at selected senior citizen clubs 
      in Klang Valley, Malaysia. The 7-day recall Diet History Questionnaire was used to 
      assess participants' dietary nutrient intake. Fasting blood samples were also 
      collected for lipid profile assessment. All participants performed N-back (0- and 
      1-back) working memory tasks during fMRI scanning. DLPFC (Brodmann's areas 9 and 46, 
      and inferior, middle, and superior frontal gyrus) was identified as a region of 
      interest for analysis. RESULTS: Positive associations were observed between dietary 
      intake of energy, protein, cholesterol, vitamins B6 and B12, potassium, iron, 
      phosphorus, magnesium, and HDL-C with DLPFC activation (P<0.05). Multivariate 
      analysis showed that vitamin B6 intake, β=0.505, t (14)=3.29, P=0.023, and Digit 
      Symbol score, β=0.413, t (14)=2.89, P=0.045; R (2)=0.748, were positively related to 
      DLPFC activation. CONCLUSION: Increased vitamin B6 intake and cognitive processing 
      speed were related to greater activation in the DLPFC region, which was responsible 
      for working memory, executive function, attention, planning, and decision making. 
      Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the association.

TI  - Family Income Mediates the Effect of Parental Education on Adolescents' Hippocampus 
      Activation During an N-Back Memory Task.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci10080520 [doi]
LID - 520
AB  - Introduction: Hippocampus, a medial temporal lobe structure, has significant 
      implications in memory formation and learning. Although hippocampus activity is 
      believed to be affected by socioeconomic status (SES), limited knowledge exists on 
      which SES indicators influence hippocampus function. Purpose: This study explored 
      the separate and combined effects of three SES indicators, namely parental 
      education, family income, and neighborhood income, on adolescents' hippocampus 
      activation during an N-Back memory task. As some of the effects of parental 
      education may be through income, we also tested if the effect of parental education 
      on hippocampus activation during our N-Back memory task is mediated by family or 
      neighborhood income. Methods: The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) 
      study is a national multi-center investigation of American adolescents' brain 
      development. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of a total sample of 
      3067 9-10-year-old adolescents were used. The primary outcome was left- hippocampus 
      activation during the N-Back memory task (mean beta weight for N-Back run 1 2 back 
      versus 0 back contrast in left hippocampus). The independent variable was parental 
      education. Family income and neighborhood income were two possible mediators. Age, 
      sex, and marital status were the covariates. To test mediation, we used hierarchical 
      linear regression models first without and then with our mediators. Full mediation 
      was defined according to Kenny. The Sobel test was used to confirm statistical 
      mediation. Results: In the absence of family and neighborhood income in the model, 
      higher parental educational attainment was associated with lower level of left 
      hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory task. This effect was significant 
      while age, sex, and marital status were controlled. The association between parental 
      educational attainment and hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory task was 
      no more significant when we controlled for family and neighborhood income. Instead, 
      family income was associated with hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory 
      task. These findings suggested that family income fully mediates the effect of 
      parental educational attainment on left hippocampus activation during the N-Back 
      memory task. Conclusions: The effect of parental educational attainment on 
      adolescents' hippocampus activation during an N-Back memory task is fully explained 
      by family income. That means low family income is why adolescents with low-educated 
      parents show highlighted hippocampus activation during an N-Back memory task. Given 
      the central role of the hippocampus in learning and memory and as income is a 
      modifiable factor by tax and economic policies, income-redistribution policies, fair 
      taxation, and higher minimum wage may have implications for promotion of adolescent 
      equality and social justice. There is a need to focus on family-level economic needs 
      across all levels of neighborhood income.

TI  - Neural response to working memory demand predicts neurocognitive deficits in HIV.
PG  - 291-304
LID - 10.1007/s13365-017-0607-z [doi]
AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to have adverse effects on cognition 
      and the brain in many infected people, despite a reduced incidence of HIV-associated 
      dementia with combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Working memory is often 
      affected, along with attention, executive control, and cognitive processing speed. 
      Verbal working memory (VWM) requires the interaction of each of the cognitive 
      component processes along with a phonological loop for verbal repetition and 
      rehearsal. HIV-related functional brain response abnormalities during VWM are 
      evident in functional MRI (fMRI), though the neural substrate underlying these 
      neurocognitive deficits is not well understood. The current study addressed this by 
      comparing 24 HIV+ to 27 demographically matched HIV-seronegative (HIV-) adults with 
      respect to fMRI activation on a VWM paradigm (n-back) relative to performance on two 
      standardized tests of executive control, attention and processing speed (Stroop and 
      Trail Making A-B). As expected, the HIV+ group had deficits on these neurocognitive 
      tests compared to HIV- controls, and also differed in neural response on fMRI 
      relative to neuropsychological performance. Reduced activation in VWM task-related 
      brain regions on the 2-back was associated with Stroop interference deficits in HIV+ 
      but not with either Trail Making A or B performance. Activation of the posterior 
      cingulate cortex (PCC) of the default mode network during rest was associated with 
      Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-2 (HVLT-2) learning in HIV+. These effects were not 
      observed in the HIV- controls. Reduced dynamic range of neural response was also 
      evident in HIV+ adults when activation on the 2-back condition was compared to the 
      extent of activation of the default mode network during periods of rest. Neural 
      dynamic range was associated with both Stroop and HVLT-2 performance. These findings 
      provide evidence that HIV-associated alterations in neural activation induced by VWM 
      demands and during rest differentially predict executive-attention and verbal 
      learning deficits. That the Stroop, but not Trail Making was associated with VWM 
      activation suggests that attentional regulation difficulties in suppressing 
      interference and/or conflict regulation are a component of working memory deficits 
      in HIV+ adults. Alterations in neural dynamic range may be a useful index of the 
      impact of HIV on functional brain response and as a fMRI metric in predicting 
      cognitive outcomes.

AB  - Adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a serious mental disorder 
      associated with impaired neurocognitive performance related to working memory 
      function. Recent clinical trials have suggested that mindfulness is a promising 
      intervention in adults with ADHD. We performed a randomised controlled clinical 
      trial to investigate working memory (WM) with an n-back task in adults with ADHD 
      during fMRI before and after an 8-week mindfulness intervention (MAP) compared with 
      psychoeducation (PE). ADHD symptoms were assessed using the self- and observer-rated 
      Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS). The complete pre-post data of 21 MAP and 
      19 PE participants were analysed. We found no group difference in ADHD symptoms or 
      task performance at the pre-measurement, but there was a significant decrease in 
      ADHD symptoms and significant improvement in task performance in both groups at the 
      post-measurement. Furthermore, we found a significant increase in task-related 
      activation in the right parietal lobe, with no difference between groups. 
      Exploratory two-sample paired t-tests revealed significant increased brain 
      activation after MAP in the bilateral inferior parietal lobule, right posterior 
      insula and right precuneus. A decrease in self-rated 'Inattention/Memory Problems' 
      after MAP compared to baseline was associated with stronger activation in parts of 
      the left putamen, globus pallidus and thalamus.

AB  - There is an increasing use of "Novel Psychoactive Substances" containing synthetic 
      cannabinoids worldwide. Synthetic cannabinoids (SC) are highly addictive and cause 
      severe adverse effects. The purpose of our study was to assess whether chronic use 
      of SC alters brain volume and function. Fifteen SC chronic users and 15 healthy 
      control participants undertook an MRI scan to assess brain volume and function while 
      performing a working memory N-back task and a response-inhibition Go-No-Go task. SC 
      users showed impaired performance on the N-back task but not on the Go-No-Go task. 
      They also showed reduced total gray matter volume compared with control 
      participants, as well as reduced gray matter volume in several cortical regions 
      including the middle frontal gyrus, frontal orbital gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, 
      insula, anterior cingulate cortex and the precuneus. Moreover, SC users showed 
      diminished brain activations in the precuneus, cuneus, lingual gyrus, hippocampus 
      and cerebellum while performing the N-back task. No differences were found in brain 
      activation while performing the response-inhibition task. This is the first study 
      showing overall reduced grey matter volume and specific reduced grey matter volumes 
      in chronic SC users. Furthermore, this study showed for the first time impairment in 
      the neural brain mechanisms responsible for working memory in SC users. Our results 
      of reduced grey matter density and diminished activation during a working memory 
      task in SC users, may suggest vulnerability of the frontal-parietal network in 
      chronic SC users.

AB  - Deactivation of the default mode network (DMN) is one of the most reliable 
      observations from neuroimaging and has significant implications in development, 
      aging, and various neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the neural mechanism 
      underlying DMN deactivation remains elusive. As the coordination of regional 
      neurochemical substrates and interregional neural interactions are both essential in 
      support of brain functions, a quantitative description of how they impact DMN 
      deactivation may provide new insights into the mechanism. Using an n-back working 
      memory task fMRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we probed the pairwise 
      relationship between task-induced deactivation, interregional functional 
      connectivity and regional excitation-inhibition balance (evaluated by glutamate/GABA 
      ratio) in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCu). Task-induced PCC/PCu 
      deactivation correlated with its excitation-inhibition balance and interregional 
      functional connectivity, where participants with lower glutamate/GABA ratio, 
      stronger intra-DMN connections and stronger antagonistic DMN-SN (salience 
      network)/ECN (executive control network) inter-network connections had greater 
      PCC/PCu deactivation. Mediation analyses revealed that the DMN-SN functional 
      interactions partially mediated the relationship between task-induced deactivation 
      and the excitation-inhibition balance at the PCC/PCu. The triple-relationship 
      discovered in the present study has the potential to bridge DMN-deactivation related 
      findings from various neuroimaging modalities and may provide new insights into the 
      neural mechanism of DMN deactivation. Moreover, this finding may have significant 
      implications for neuropsychiatric disorders related to the DMN dysfunction and 
      suggests an integrated application of pharmacological and neuromodulation-based 
      strategies for rescuing DMN deactivation deficits.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia spectrum disorders are heritable illnesses that usually 
      manifest in early adulthood but are increasingly viewed as neurodevelopmental 
      disorders. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies show altered brain 
      activity during performance of working memory (WM) tasks in both individuals with 
      schizophrenia and their first-degree relatives as compared to healthy controls (HC). 
      This study examined whether similar changes are already present in pre-adolescent 
      children at familial high-risk (FHR) for psychosis. METHODS: 37 children (17 FHR, 20 
      HC) between 7 and 12 years old participated in this study. WM performance was 
      assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV (WISC-IV). To assess 
      brain activation during WM performance, participants completed a visual 
      block-designed n-back task with 2 conditions (2-back and 0-back) during scanning. 
      fMRI data was preprocessed and analyzed using FSL Feat. RESULTS: Compared to HC, FHR 
      children showed significantly lower WISC-IV WM scores. In addition, FHR children 
      exhibited hypoactivation in the 2-back (versus 0-back) condition in a cluster 
      encompassing bilateral precuneus and cuneus and right posterior cingulate cortex. 
      There were no significant group-differences in n-back task performance and brain 
      activation. The precuneus cluster was not correlated with n-back performance or WISC 
      WM scores. CONCLUSIONS: The current results provide preliminary evidence of impaired 
      WM function and altered brain activity during WM performance in children with a 
      familial predisposition for psychosis. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine 
      whether these findings are related to abnormal brain development and predictive of 
      cognitive deficits and psychosis later in life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood maltreatment can have detrimental consequences on individual 
      well-being and cognitive functioning. One type of childhood maltreatment that 
      remains stigmatized and under-researched among men is child sexual abuse (CSA). 
      Research examining the neurophysiological consequences of CSA in males is limited 
      even further. OBJECTIVE: To provide preliminary insight into the neural basis of the 
      impact of CSA during two working memory tasks. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Men with 
      CSA histories, with and without post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; CSA + PTSD 
      n = 7, mean age = 45; CSA-PTSD; n = 9, mean age = 41), and men without a CSA history 
      nor PTSD (n = 13, mean age = 36) participated in the study at a local hospital. 
      METHODS: Participants completed a letter n-back task and an emotional picture n-back 
      task during fMRI to measure working memory and the influence of emotion on working 
      memory. They also completed self-report measures to assess mental health and 
      childhood abuse histories. RESULTS: In the letter n-back task, men with CSA + PTSD 
      had less activation in the cerebellum and left fusiform gyrus compared to CSA-PTSD 
      men. During the working memory task with negative emotional pictures the control 
      group had greater frontal activation, while the CSA-PTSD group had greater limbic 
      activation. Analyses were performed with independent-samples t-tests. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study provides preliminary empirical evidence of the impact CSA can have on men 
      regarding working memory when negative stimuli are involved. It highlights that CSA, 
      even without a diagnosis of PTSD, can have a significant neurophysiological impact. 
      It also provides clinicians with information to support well-being and help with 
      potential day to day challenges.

AB  - Loneliness affects up to 40 % of middle-aged and older adults, and is closely 
      associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the relationship between 
      loneliness and neural network functioning during executive cognitive processes, such 
      as working memory, in MDD is still unclear. To address this gap, our study recruited 
      21 medicated MDD patients (mean age = 52.0 ± 5 years) and 24 matched healthy 
      controls (HC) (mean age = 48.7 ± 6 years) who completed an n-back fMRI task. For 
      behavioural performance, we observed no significant moderating effect of MDD or 
      loneliness on the task condition effect. However, loneliness was positively 
      associated, and MDD was negatively associated, with the functional connectivity 
      between the inferior parietal cortex and the rostral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex 
      (DMPFC) during task performance. Furthermore, an interactive effect of loneliness 
      and MDD was observed on the functional connectivity between the supplementary motor 
      area and the caudal DMPFC during the n-back task, with loneliness showing a positive 
      relationship in the HC group but a negative relationship in the MDD group with the 
      connectivity. Our results indicated that loneliness may be associated with altered 
      neural regulatory functioning on self-referential processing and action control, 
      which may further depend on the individual's depressive state. These findings can 
      form the theoretical basis for devising intervention programme aimed at improving 
      the mental wellness of the healthy and depressed lonely individuals.

TI  - Intensive Working Memory Training Produces Functional Changes in Large-scale 
      Frontoparietal Networks.
PG  - 575-88
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00916 [doi]
AB  - Working memory is central to human cognition, and intensive cognitive training has 
      been shown to expand working memory capacity in a given domain. It remains unknown, 
      however, how the neural systems that support working memory are altered through 
      intensive training to enable the expansion of working memory capacity. We used fMRI 
      to measure plasticity in activations associated with complex working memory before 
      and after 20 days of training. Healthy young adults were randomly assigned to train 
      on either a dual n-back working memory task or a demanding visuospatial attention 
      task. Training resulted in substantial and task-specific expansion of dual n-back 
      abilities accompanied by changes in the relationship between working memory load and 
      activation. Training differentially affected activations in two large-scale 
      frontoparietal networks thought to underlie working memory: the executive control 
      network and the dorsal attention network. Activations in both networks linearly 
      scaled with working memory load before training, but training dissociated the role 
      of the two networks and eliminated this relationship in the executive control 
      network. Load-dependent functional connectivity both within and between these two 
      networks increased following training, and the magnitudes of increased connectivity 
      were positively correlated with improvements in task performance. These results 
      provide insight into the adaptive neural systems that underlie large gains in 
      working memory capacity through training.

TI  - Working Memory for Signs with Poor Visual Resolution: fMRI Evidence of 
      Reorganization of Auditory Cortex in Deaf Signers.
PG  - 3165-3176
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhaa400 [doi]
AB  - Stimulus degradation adds to working memory load during speech processing. We 
      investigated whether this applies to sign processing and, if so, whether the 
      mechanism implicates secondary auditory cortex. We conducted an fMRI experiment 
      where 16 deaf early signers (DES) and 22 hearing non-signers performed a sign-based 
      n-back task with three load levels and stimuli presented at high and low resolution. 
      We found decreased behavioral performance with increasing load and decreasing visual 
      resolution, but the neurobiological mechanisms involved differed between the two 
      manipulations and did so for both groups. Importantly, while the load manipulation 
      was, as predicted, accompanied by activation in the frontoparietal working memory 
      network, the resolution manipulation resulted in temporal and occipital activation. 
      Furthermore, we found evidence of cross-modal reorganization in the secondary 
      auditory cortex: DES had stronger activation and stronger connectivity between this 
      and several other regions. We conclude that load and stimulus resolution have 
      different neural underpinnings in the visual-verbal domain, which has consequences 
      for current working memory models, and that for DES the secondary auditory cortex is 
      involved in the binding of representations when task demands are low.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: N-back tasks are commonly used in functional neuroimaging studies to 
      identify the neural mechanisms supporting working memory (WM). Despite widespread 
      use, the clinical utility of these tasks is not well specified. This study compared 
      N-back performance during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with task 
      data acquired outside of the scanner as a measure of reliability across environment. 
      N-back task validity was examined in relation to performance and rater-based 
      measures used clinically to assess working memory. METHOD: Forty-three healthy 
      adults completed verbal and object N-back tasks during fMRI scanning and outside the 
      scanner. Task difficulty was varied parametrically (0, 1, and 2-back conditions). 
      Order of N-back task completion was stratified by modality (verbal/object) and 
      environment. Participants completed the Digit Span (DS) and provided self-ratings 
      using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF-WM). RESULTS: Mean 
      verbal and object N-back accuracy was above 95% across load conditions; task 
      difficulty was effectively manipulated across load conditions. Performance accuracy 
      did not significantly differ by environment. N-back reaction time was slower during 
      fMRI (F = 6.52, p = .01, ηp(2) = .13); participants were faster when initially 
      completing tasks outside the scanner (ηp(2) = .10-.15). Verbal 2-back accuracy was 
      significantly related to DS performance (r = .36, p = .02). N-back performance was 
      not related to BRIEF-WM. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence for reliability 
      of N-back accuracy during fMRI scanning; however, reliability of reaction time data 
      is affected by order of task presentation. Data regarding construct validity are 
      inconsistent and emphasize the need to consider clinical utility of behavioral 
      measures in the design and interpretation of functional neuroimaging studies.

TI  - Relationship between working-memory network function and substance use: a 3-year 
      longitudinal fMRI study in heavy cannabis users and controls.

AB  - Deficient executive functions play an important role in the development of 
      addiction. Working-memory may therefore be a powerful predictor of the course of 
      drug use, but chronic substance use may also impair working-memory. The aim of this 
      3-year longitudinal neuro-imaging study was to investigate the relationship between 
      substance use (e.g. alcohol, cannabis, nicotine, illegal psychotropic drugs) and 
      working-memory network function over time in heavy cannabis users and controls. 
      Forty-nine participants performed an n-back working-memory task at baseline and at 
      3-year follow-up. At follow-up, there were 22 current heavy cannabis users, 4 
      abstinent heavy cannabis users and 23 non-cannabis-using controls. 
      Tensor-independent component analysis (Tensor-ICA) was used to investigate 
      individual differences in working-memory network functionality over time. Within the 
      group of cannabis users, cannabis-related problems remained stable, whereas 
      alcohol-related problems, nicotine dependence and illegal psychotropic substance use 
      increased over time. At both measurements, behavioral performance and network 
      functionality during the n-back task did not differ between heavy cannabis users and 
      controls. Although n-back accuracy improved, working-memory network function 
      remained stable over time. Within the group of cannabis users, working-memory 
      network functionality was not associated with substance use. These results suggest 
      that sustained moderate to heavy levels of cannabis, nicotine, alcohol and illegal 
      psychotropic substance use do not change working-memory network functionality. 
      Moreover, baseline network functionality did not predict cannabis use and related 
      problems three years later, warranting longitudinal studies in more chronic or 
      dependent cannabis users.

AB  - Gaming experience has been suggested to lead to performance enhancements in a wide 
      variety of working memory tasks. Previous studies have, however, mostly focused on 
      adult expert gamers and have not included measurements of both behavioral 
      performance and brain activity. In the current study, 167 adolescents and young 
      adults (aged 13-24 years) with different amounts of gaming experience performed an 
      n-back working memory task with vowels, with the sensory modality of the vowel 
      stream switching between audition and vision at random intervals. We studied the 
      relationship between self-reported daily gaming activity, working memory (n-back) 
      task performance and related brain activity measured using functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI). The results revealed that the extent of daily gaming 
      activity was related to enhancements in both performance accuracy and speed during 
      the most demanding (2-back) level of the working memory task. This improved working 
      memory performance was accompanied by enhanced recruitment of a fronto-parietal 
      cortical network, especially the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In contrast, during 
      the less demanding (1-back) level of the task, gaming was associated with decreased 
      activity in the same cortical regions. Our results suggest that a greater degree of 
      daily gaming experience is associated with better working memory functioning and 
      task difficulty-dependent modulation in fronto-parietal brain activity already in 
      adolescence and even when non-expert gamers are studied. The direction of causality 
      within this association cannot be inferred with certainty due to the correlational 
      nature of the current study.

AB  - Dyslexia is an impairment in learning to read and write, primarily associated with a 
      phonological core deficit. However, the manifestation of symptoms in dyslexia also 
      includes impaired working memory (WM). The aim of this study was to investigate 
      cortical activation related to verbal WM in dyslexic and normal readers aged around 
      13 years, controlling for phonological awareness processing. We used a modified WM 
      n-back task where the participants remembered the first or last speech segment 
      (phonemes) of the names of common objects shown as pictures. Dyslexic readers were 
      impaired compared with the control group. Compared with the dyslexic readers, 
      controls showed increased fMRI activation in the left superior parietal lobule and 
      the right inferior prefrontal gyrus. Unlike controls, dyslexics did not show a 
      significant increase in activation in WM areas with increased memory load. These 
      findings provide support for a specific working memory deficit in dyslexic 
      individuals.

AB  - Attending and responding to sound location generates increased activity in parietal 
      cortex which may index auditory spatial working memory and/or goal-directed action. 
      Here, we used an n-back task (Experiment 1) and an adaptation paradigm (Experiment 
      2) to distinguish memory-related activity from that associated with goal-directed 
      action. In Experiment 1, participants indicated, in separate blocks of trials, 
      whether the incoming stimulus was presented at the same location as in the previous 
      trial (1-back) or two trials ago (2-back). Prior to a block of trials, participants 
      were told to use their left or right index finger. Accuracy and reaction times were 
      worse for the 2-back than for the 1-back condition. The analysis of functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging data revealed greater sustained task-related activity in 
      the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and superior frontal sulcus during 2-back than 
      1-back after accounting for response-related activity elicited by the targets. 
      Target detection and response execution were also associated with enhanced activity 
      in the IPL bilaterally, though the activation was anterior to that associated with 
      sustained task-related activity. In Experiment 2, we used an event-related design in 
      which participants listened (no response required) to trials that comprised four 
      sounds presented either at the same location or at four different locations. We 
      found larger IPL activation for changes in sound location than for sounds presented 
      at the same location. The IPL activation overlapped with that observed during the 
      auditory spatial working memory task. Together, these results provide converging 
      evidence supporting the role of parietal cortex in auditory spatial working memory 
      which can be dissociated from response selection and execution.

AB  - Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonism is a promising new treatment for cognitive 
      dysfunction in psychiatric disorders but the effects of GR antagonism on cognition 
      related brain activity is poorly understood. This study examines the effects of the 
      GR and progesterone receptor antagonist mifepristone on the neural correlates of 
      visuospatial learning and working memory in healthy male participants. The study 
      used a pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design to 
      determine mifepristone effects on visuospatial paired associates learning (vPAL) and 
      n-back working memory (WM) fMRI task related brain activations. 20 right-handed 
      healthy male participants received 600 mg mifepristone or placebo on two separate 
      imaging days and each participant performed fMRI tasks four hours later. The effect 
      of mifepristone on task related brain activations was determined using Region of 
      Interest (ROI) fMRI analyses and an exploratory whole brain voxel-wise fMRI task 
      analyses was also conducted. The vPAL task ROI analysis found that mifepristone 
      administration was significantly associated with decreased fusiform cortex 
      activations in first and second encoding blocks (p = 0.007, p = 0.04) and decreased 
      angular and precuneal cortices activations in the first recall block (p = 0.01, 
      p = 0.02). There were no significant differences in fMRI brain activations 
      associated with mifepristone administration in the n-back task ROI's (all p > 0.05). 
      Mifepristone administration did not significantly affect fMRI brain activations in 
      the whole brain voxel-wise analyses for both tasks. N-back and vPAL task reaction 
      times and accuracy were similar in both mifepristone and placebo conditions (all 
      p > 0.05). Our finding of decreased fusiform, angular and precuneal vPAL task 
      related brain activity associated with mifepristone administration for the same 
      behavioural performance as found in the placebo condition may represent improved 
      efficiency of visuospatial memory encoding and recall. These findings provide 
      evidence that mifepristone may enhance the efficiency of human visuospatial memory 
      and calls for further studies in patient populations using an fMRI approach to 
      provide proof of concept for new treatments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia endophenotypes may help elucidate functional effects of 
      genetic risk variants in multiply affected consanguineous families that segregate 
      recessive risk alleles of large effect size. We studied the association between a 
      schizophrenia risk locus involving a 6.1Mb homozygous region on chromosome 13q22-31 
      in a consanguineous multiplex family and cognitive functioning, haemodynamic 
      response and white matter integrity using neuroimaging. METHODS: We performed CANTAB 
      neuropsychological testing on four affected family members (all homozygous for the 
      risk locus), ten unaffected family members (seven homozygous and three heterozygous) 
      and ten healthy volunteers, and tested neuronal responses on fMRI during an n-back 
      working memory task, and white matter integrity on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) on 
      four affected and six unaffected family members (four homozygous and two 
      heterozygous) and three healthy volunteers. For cognitive comparisons we used a 
      linear mixed model (Kruskal-Wallis) test, followed by posthoc Dunn's pairwise tests 
      with a Bonferroni adjustment. For fMRI analysis, we counted voxels exceeding the p < 
      0.05 corrected threshold. DTI analysis was observational. RESULTS: Family members 
      with schizophrenia and unaffected family members homozygous for the risk haplotype 
      showed attention (p < 0.01) and working memory deficits (p < 0.01) compared with 
      healthy controls; a neural activation laterality bias towards the right prefrontal 
      cortex (voxels reaching p < 0.05, corrected) and observed lower fractional 
      anisotropy in the anterior cingulate cortex and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In this family, homozygosity at the 13q risk locus was associated with 
      impaired cognition, white matter integrity, and altered laterality of neural 
      activation.

TI  - Association Between Childhood Anhedonia and Alterations in Large-scale Resting-State 
      Networks and Task-Evoked Activation.
PG  - 624-633
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.0020 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Anhedonia can present in children and predict detrimental clinical 
      outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To map anhedonia in children onto changes in intrinsic 
      large-scale connectivity and task-evoked activation and to probe the specificity of 
      these changes in anhedonia against other clinical phenotypes (low mood, anxiety, and 
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were from the first annual release 
      of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, collected between September 
      2016 and September 2017 and analyzed between April and September 2018. 
      Cross-sectional data of children aged 9 to 10 years from unreferred, community 
      samples during rest (n = 2878) and during reward anticipation (n = 2874) and working 
      memory (n = 2745) were analyzed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Alterations in fMRI 
      data during rest, reward anticipation, and working memory were examined, using both 
      frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Functional MRI connectivity within large-scale 
      networks, between networks, and between networks and subcortical regions were 
      examined during rest. Functional MRI activation were examined during reward 
      anticipation and working memory using the monetary incentive delayed and N-back 
      tasks, respectively. RESULTS: Among 2878 children with adequate-quality 
      resting-state fMRI data (mean [SD] age, 10.03 [0.62] years; 1400 girls [48.6%]), 
      children with anhedonia (261 [9.1%]), compared with those without anhedonia (2617 
      [90.9%]), showed hypoconnectivity among various large-scale networks and subcortical 
      regions, including between the arousal-related cingulo-opercular network and 
      reward-related ventral striatum area (mean [SD] with anhedonia, 0.08 [0.10] vs 
      without anhedonia, 0.10 [0.10]; t2,876 = 3.33; P < .001; q[false discovery 
      rate] = 0.03; ln[Bayes factor10] = 2.85). Such hypoconnectivity did not manifest 
      among children with low mood (277 of 2878 [9.62%]), anxiety (109 of 2878 [3.79%]), 
      or ADHD (459 of 2878 [15.95%]), suggesting specificity. Similarly, among 2874 
      children (mean [SD] age, 10.03 [0.62] years; 1414 girls [49.2%]) with high-quality 
      task-evoked fMRI data, children with anhedonia (248 of 2874 [8.63%]) demonstrated 
      hypoactivation during reward anticipation in various areas, including the dorsal 
      striatum and areas of the cingulo-opercular network. This hypoactivity was not found 
      among children with low mood (268 of 2874 [9.32%]), anxiety (90 of 2874 [3.13%]), or 
      ADHD (473 of 2874 [16.46%]). Moreover, we also found context- and phenotype-specific 
      double dissociations; while children with anhedonia showed altered activation during 
      reward anticipation (but not working memory), those with ADHD showed altered 
      activation during working memory (but not reward anticipation). CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: Using the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study data set, 
      phenotype-specific alterations were found in intrinsic large-scale connectivity and 
      task-evoked activation in children with anhedonia. The hypoconnectivity at rest and 
      hypoactivation during reward anticipation complementarily map anhedonia onto 
      aberrations in neural-cognitive processes: lack of intrinsic reward-arousal 
      integration during rest and diminishment of extrinsic reward-arousal activity during 
      reward anticipation. These findings help delineate the pathophysiological 
      underpinnings of anhedonia in children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Imaging studies help to understand the evolution of key cognitive 
      processes related to aging, such as working memory (WM). This study aimed to test 
      three hypotheses in older adults. First, that the brain activation pattern 
      associated to WM processes in elderly during successful low load tasks is located in 
      posterior sensory and associative areas; second, that the prefrontal and parietal 
      cortex and basal ganglia should be more active during high-demand tasks; third, that 
      cerebellar activations are related to high-demand cognitive tasks and have a 
      specific lateralization depending on the condition. METHODS: We used a 
      neuropsychological assessment with functional magnetic resonance imaging and a core 
      N-back paradigm design that was maintained across the combination of four conditions 
      of stimuli and two memory loads in a sample of twenty elderly subjects. RESULTS: 
      During low-loads, activations were located in the visual ventral network. In high 
      loads, there was an involvement of the basal ganglia and cerebellum in addition to 
      the frontal and parietal cortices. Moreover, we detected an executive control role 
      of the cerebellum in a relatively symmetric fronto-parietal network. Nevertheless, 
      this network showed a predominantly left lateralization in parietal regions 
      associated presumably with an overuse of verbal storage strategies. The differential 
      activations between conditions were stimuli-dependent and were located in sensory 
      areas. CONCLUSION: Successful WM processes in the elderly population are accompanied 
      by an activation pattern that involves cerebellar regions working together with a 
      fronto-parietal network.

TI  - Contributions of Brain Function and Structure to Three Different Domains of 
      Cognitive Control in Normal Aging.
PG  - 1-22
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_01685 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive control involves the flexible allocation of mental resources during 
      goal-directed behavior and comprises three correlated but distinct 
      domains-inhibition, shifting, and working memory. The work of Don Stuss and others 
      has demonstrated that frontal and parietal cortices are crucial to cognitive 
      control, particularly in normal aging, which is characterized by reduced control 
      mechanisms. However, the structure-function relationships specific to each domain 
      and subsequent impact on performance are not well understood. In the current study, 
      we examined both age and individual differences in functional activity associated 
      with core domains of cognitive control in relation to fronto-parietal structure and 
      task performance. Participants (N = 140, aged 20-86 years) completed three fMRI 
      tasks: go/no-go (inhibition), task switching (shifting), and n-back (working 
      memory), in addition to structural and diffusion imaging. All three tasks engaged a 
      common set of fronto-parietal regions; however, the contributions of age, brain 
      structure, and task performance to functional activity were unique to each domain. 
      Aging was associated with differences in functional activity for all tasks, largely 
      in regions outside common fronto-parietal control regions. Shifting and inhibition 
      showed greater contributions of structure to overall decreases in brain activity, 
      suggesting that more intact fronto-parietal structure may serve as a scaffold for 
      efficient functional response. Working memory showed no contribution of structure to 
      functional activity but had strong effects of age and task performance. Together, 
      these results provide a comprehensive and novel examination of the joint 
      contributions of aging, performance, and brain structure to functional activity 
      across multiple domains of cognitive control.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: To explore the effectiveness of a specific working memory (WM) 
      training program in MS patients and healthy controls (HC). METHOD: 29 MS patients 
      and 29 matched HC were enrolled in the study. MS and HC were randomly split into two 
      groups: nontraining groups (15HC/14 MS) and training groups (14 HC/15 MS). Training 
      groups underwent adaptive n-back training (60 min/day; 4 days). Functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to monitor brain activity during n-back 
      performance (conditions: 0-back, 2-back, and 3-back) at 3 time points: (1) baseline, 
      (2) post-training (+7days), and (3) follow-up (+35days). RESULTS: In post-training 
      and follow-up fMRI sessions, trained groups (HC and MS patients) exhibited 
      significant reaction time (RT) reductions and increases in Correct Responses (CRs) 
      during 2-back and 3-back performance. This improvement of task performance was 
      accompanied by a decrease in brain activation in the WM frontoparietal network. The 
      two effects were significantly correlated. CONCLUSIONS: After WM training, both 
      cognitively preserved MS patients and HC participants showed task performance 
      improvement made possible by neuroplastic processes that enhanced neural efficiency.

TI  - Merging clinical neuropsychology and functional neuroimaging to evaluate the 
      construct validity and neural network engagement of the n-back task.
PG  - 736-50

AB  - The n-back task is a widely used neuroimaging paradigm for studying the neural basis 
      of working memory (WM); however, its neuropsychometric properties have received 
      little empirical investigation. The present study merged clinical neuropsychology 
      and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the construct validity 
      of the letter variant of the n-back task (LNB) and to further identify the 
      task-evoked networks involved in WM. Construct validity of the LNB task was 
      investigated using a bootstrapping approach to correlate LNB task performance across 
      clinically validated neuropsychological measures of WM to establish convergent 
      validity, as well as measures of related but distinct cognitive constructs (i.e., 
      attention and short-term memory) to establish discriminant validity. Independent 
      component analysis (ICA) identified brain networks active during the LNB task in 34 
      healthy control participants, and general linear modeling determined 
      task-relatedness of these networks. Bootstrap correlation analyses revealed moderate 
      to high correlations among measures expected to converge with LNB (|ρ|≥ 0.37) and 
      weak correlations among measures expected to discriminate (|ρ|≤ 0.29), controlling 
      for age and education. ICA identified 35 independent networks, 17 of which 
      demonstrated engagement significantly related to task condition, controlling for 
      reaction time variability. Of these, the bilateral frontoparietal networks, 
      bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, bilateral superior parietal lobules 
      including precuneus, and frontoinsular network were preferentially recruited by the 
      2-back condition compared to 0-back control condition, indicating WM involvement. 
      These results support the use of the LNB as a measure of WM and confirm its use in 
      probing the network-level neural correlates of WM processing.

AB  - Dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS) is an adrenal androgen that is, in part, 
      aromatized to estradiol. It continues to be produced after menopause and provides 
      estrogenicity after depletion of ovarian hormones. Estradiol depletion contributes 
      to memory circuitry changes over menopause, including changes in hippocampal (HIPP) 
      and dorsolateral- and ventrolateral-prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; VLPFC) function. 
      Further, major depressive disorder (MDD) patients have, in general, lower levels of 
      estradiol and lower DHEAS than healthy controls, thus potentially a higher risk of 
      adverse menopausal outcomes. We investigated whether higher DHEAS levels after 
      menopause is associated with better memory circuitry function, especially in women 
      with MDD. 212 adults (ages 45-55, 50% women) underwent clinical and fMRI testing. 
      Participants performed a working memory (WM) N-back task and an episodic memory 
      verbal encoding (VE) task during fMRI scanning. DHEAS levels were significantly 
      associated with memory circuitry function, specifically in MDD postmenopausal women. 
      On the WM task, lower DHEAS levels were associated with increased HIPP activity. On 
      the VE task, lower DHEAS levels were associated with decreased activity in the HIPP 
      and VLPFC. In contrast, there was no association between DHEAS levels and memory 
      circuitry function in MDD pre/perimenopausal women, men, and non-MDD participants 
      regardless of sex and reproductive status. In fact, MDD postmenopausal women with 
      higher levels of DHEAS were similar to MDD pre/perimenopausal women and men. Thus, 
      memory circuitry deficits associated with MDD and a lower ability of the adrenal 
      gland to produce DHEAS after menopause may contribute to a lower ability to maintain 
      intact memory function with age.

TI  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging study of working memory several years after 
      pediatric concussion.
PG  - 895-904
LID - 10.1080/02699052.2020.1753240 [doi]
AB  - PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: The neurophysiological effects of pediatric concussion several 
      years after injury remain inadequately characterized. The objective of this study 
      was to determine if a history of concussion was associated with BOLD response 
      differences during an n-back working memory task in youth. RESEARCH DESIGN: 
      Observational, cross-sectional. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Participants include 52 
      children and adolescents (M = 15.1 years, 95%CI = 14.4-15.8, range = 9-19) with past 
      concussion (n = 33) or orthopedic injury (OI; n = 19). Mean time since injury was 
      2.5 years (95%CI = 2.0-3.0). Measures included postconcussion symptom ratings, 
      neuropsychological testing, and blood-oxygen-dependent-level (BOLD) functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an n-back working memory task. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: Groups did not differ on accuracy or speed during the three 
      n-back conditions. They also did not differ in BOLD signal change for the 1- vs. 
      0-back or 2- vs. 0-back contrasts (controlling for task performance). CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study does not support group differences in BOLD response during an n-back 
      working memory task in youth who are on average 2.5 years post-concussion. The 
      findings are encouraging from the perspective of understanding recovery after 
      pediatric concussion.

AB  - Although the relationship between resting-state functional connectivity and 
      task-related activity has been addressed, the relationship between task and 
      resting-state directed or effective connectivity - and its behavioral concomitants - 
      remains elusive. We evaluated effective connectivity under an N-back working memory 
      task in 24 participants using stochastic dynamic causal modelling (DCM) of 7 T fMRI 
      data. We repeated the analysis using resting-state data, from the same subjects, to 
      model connectivity among the same brain regions engaged by the N-back task. This 
      allowed us to: (i) examine the relationship between intrinsic (task-independent) 
      effective connectivity during resting (A(rest)) and task states (A(task)), (ii) 
      cluster phenotypes of task-related changes in effective connectivity (B(task)) 
      across participants, (iii) identify edges (B(task)) showing high inter-individual 
      effective connectivity differences and (iv) associate reaction times with the 
      similarity between B(task) and A(rest) in these edges. We found a strong correlation 
      between A(rest) and A(task) over subjects but a marked difference between B(task) 
      and A(rest). We further observed a strong clustering of individuals in terms of 
      B(task), which was not apparent in A(rest). The task-related effective connectivity 
      B(task) varied highly in the edges from the parietal to the frontal lobes across 
      individuals, so the three groups were clustered mainly by the effective connectivity 
      within these networks. The similarity between B(task) and A(rest) at the edges from 
      the parietal to the frontal lobes was positively correlated with 2-back reaction 
      times. This result implies that a greater change in context-sensitive coupling - 
      from resting-state connectivity - is associated with faster reaction times. In 
      summary, task-dependent connectivity endows resting-state connectivity with a 
      context sensitivity, which predicts the speed of information processing during the 
      N-back task.

TI  - Extraction of Common Task Features in EEG-fMRI Data Using Coupled Tensor-Tensor 
      Decomposition.
PG  - 636-650
LID - 10.1007/s10548-020-00787-0 [doi]
AB  - The fusion of simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI data is of great value to 
      neuroscience research due to the complementary properties of the individual 
      modalities. Traditionally, techniques such as PCA and ICA, which rely on strong 
      non-physiological assumptions such as orthogonality and statistical independence, 
      have been used for this purpose. Recently, tensor decomposition techniques such as 
      parallel factor analysis have gained more popularity in neuroimaging applications as 
      they are able to inherently contain the multidimensionality of neuroimaging data and 
      achieve uniqueness in decomposition without making strong assumptions. Previously, 
      the coupled matrix-tensor decomposition (CMTD) has been applied for the fusion of 
      the EEG and fMRI. Only recently the coupled tensor-tensor decomposition (CTTD) has 
      been proposed. Here for the first time, we propose the use of CTTD of a 4th order 
      EEG tensor (space, time, frequency, and participant) and 3rd order fMRI tensor 
      (space, time, participant), coupled partially in time and participant domains, for 
      the extraction of the task related features in both modalities. We used both the 
      sensor-level and source-level EEG for the coupling. The phase shifted paradigm 
      signals were incorporated as the temporal initializers of the CTTD to extract the 
      task related features. The validation of the approach is demonstrated on 
      simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings from six participants performing an N-Back memory 
      task. The EEG and fMRI tensors were coupled in 9 components out of which seven 
      components had a high correlation (more than 0.85) with the task. The result of the 
      fusion recapitulates the well-known attention network as being positively, and the 
      default mode network working negatively time-locked to the memory task.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined women with recurrent brief depression (RBD) with and without 
      episodes of hypomania with an n-back working memory paradigm to assess how working 
      memory load affects the neurological network corresponding to working memory for 
      these groups. METHOD: Participants (n=33) were medication-free and mostly euthymic 
      while performing a 1-back and a 2-back task in the fMRI scanner. Differential 
      activation results between the tasks were assessed globally and within seven 
      predefined regions of interest associated with working memory activation. The 
      patient groups were compared with healthy women and matched for age, handedness, and 
      length of education. RESULTS: Poor task modulation was observed in both RBD groups 
      in the prefrontal cortex (BA9) in the 1-back task and activation during the 2-back 
      task, particularly in a subgroup with a history of brief hypomanic episodes (RBD-H) 
      compared with the subgroup without such episodes (RBD-O). Task modulation in the 
      right parahippocampal gyrus (BA27) distinguished the RBD-O group, and task 
      modulation in the right insula clearly distinguished the RBD-H group. LIMITATIONS: 
      Small sample size and recruitment of most patients through media that may induce a 
      selection bias towards better-functioning subjects. CONCLUSION: The observed lack of 
      deactivation within the right insula has also been reported in patients with bipolar 
      I disorders. Activation differences in BA9 and the parahippocampal region between 
      RBD patients with and without a history of hypomania suggest different functional 
      hypersensitivity of early limbic regions and ability to sustain attention and 
      working memory, respectively, possibly identifying functional differences between 
      the two subgroups.

TI  - Atypical spatiotemporal signatures of working memory brain processes in autism.
PG  - e617
LID - 10.1038/tp.2015.107 [doi]
AB  - Working memory (WM) impairments may contribute to the profound behavioural 
      manifestations in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, previous 
      behavioural results are discrepant as are the few functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) results collected in adults and adolescents with ASD. Here we 
      investigate the precise temporal dynamics of WM-related brain activity using 
      magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 20 children with ASD and matched controls during an 
      n-back WM task across different load levels (1-back vs 2-back). Although behavioural 
      results were similar between ASD and typically developing (TD) children, the 
      between-group comparison performed on functional brain activity showed atypical 
      WM-related brain processes in children with ASD compared with TD children. These 
      atypical responses were observed in the ASD group from 200 to 600 ms post stimulus 
      in both the low- (1-back) and high- (2-back) memory load conditions. During the 
      1-back condition, children with ASD showed reduced WM-related activations in the 
      right hippocampus and the cingulate gyrus compared with TD children who showed more 
      activation in the left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex and the insulae. In the 
      2-back condition, children with ASD showed less activity in the left insula and 
      midcingulate gyrus and more activity in the left precuneus than TD children. In 
      addition, reduced activity in the anterior cingulate cortex was correlated with 
      symptom severity in children with ASD. Thus, this MEG study identified the precise 
      timing and sources of atypical WM-related activity in frontal, temporal and parietal 
      regions in children with ASD. The potential impacts of such atypicalities on social 
      deficits of autism are discussed.

AB  - Anxiety is associated with compromised cognitive control functions, such as working 
      memory. State and trait anxiety within the non-clinical population can be utilised 
      to investigate potential neural markers for anxiety, which may help to elucidate 
      potential prevention and intervention methods. Thirty-two healthy adults (20 female, 
      12 male), aged between 30 and 65 years, performed a 2-back task whilst fMRI BOLD 
      signal was acquired using a 3T scanner. Mean BOLD signal was obtained in cognitive 
      control network regions of interest of: left and right dorsolateral prefrontal 
      cortex (DLPFC) and posterior parietal lobe (PPL), and medial prefrontal cortex 
      (MPFC). State and trait anxiety levels were recorded. Higher overall anxiety was 
      moderately associated with more left and right PPL BOLD signal; there was a weak 
      relationship between anxiety and left DLPFC BOLD signal. MPFC BOLD signal and trait 
      anxiety were moderately associated with overall 2-back task performance. These 
      findings suggest that non-clinical anxiety affects the recruitment of cortical 
      resources during working memory, but that anxiety does not impair performance during 
      a 2-back task.

AB  - Several executive functions decline with the development of type-1 diabetes (T1D), 
      particularly working memory (WM). In adults, WM ensures efficient cognitive 
      processing by focusing on task-relevant information while suppressing distractors. 
      It has been well documented that WM can be influenced by emotional stimuli, which 
      may facilitate the retention of information, interfere with uptake, or even affect 
      its capacity. We evaluated the effect of T1D on visual WM processing using emotional 
      faces as stimuli, in young patients with satisfactory clinical evolution, and 
      matched controls without T1D. All subjects performed a 2-back task detecting facial 
      identity using neutral, happy or fearful faces in a block design for fMRI. 
      Behavioral performance was similar with the exception that patients responded 
      significantly slower. Most importantly, between-group differences were found in 
      patterns of brain activation. In comparison, more widespread brain activation 
      -predominantly prefrontal- was found in the participants with T1D when processing 
      neutral faces, while a decrease was observed when processing happy and fearful ones. 
      Statistical contrasts demonstrated significantly-different activation patterns 
      between groups when processing emotional faces, as controls exhibited greater 
      activation in the cuneus, posterior cortex and parahippocampal gyrus, while the 
      patients showed greater activation in the prefrontal structures. Results may reflect 
      compensatory efforts made to minimize the deleterious effects of disease development 
      on attention allocation processes and the operational efficiency of WM. The results 
      suggest that emotional parameters should be periodically assessed in individuals 
      with T1D in order to anticipate the emergence of attention and WM impairment.

AB  - Previous studies have suggested that patients with schizophrenia and healthy 
      controls exhibit differential activation of and connectivity involving the 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during working memory tasks, though their 
      findings remain inconsistent. The functional integration perspective further 
      suggests that working memory performance also modulates differences in functional 
      interactions of the DLPFC between patients and controls. To explore this 
      possibility, 45 healthy controls and 45 patients with schizophrenia were recruited 
      to perform a 2-back task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Each 
      group was further divided into two subgroups based on task performance to examine 
      the modulatory effect of performance on functional interactions of the DLPFC, as 
      measured via psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses. We observed that, in 
      patients with schizophrenia who exhibited impaired working memory capacity and 
      decreased brain activation/deactivation, functional interactions between the 
      right/left DLPFC and angular cortex were decreased relative to those of healthy 
      controls. Furthermore, we observed an interaction effect of working memory 
      performance and diagnosis on functional connectivity between the right/left DLPFC 
      seed region and posterior regions such as the angular cortex, fusiform gyrus, and 
      middle occipital gyrus. This interaction effect was mainly driven by the negative 
      correlation between functional connectivity and performance in healthy controls, and 
      by the positive correlation in patients with schizophrenia. These results 
      demonstrate the effects of inter-individual differences in working memory 
      performance on functional interactions between the DLPFC and posterior regions in 
      patients with schizophrenia as well as healthy controls, which may shed new light on 
      the neural basis of working memory.

TI  - fMRI investigation of working memory for faces in autism: visual coding and 
      underconnectivity with frontal areas.
PG  - 289-300
AB  - Brain activation and functional connectivity were investigated in high functioning 
      autism using functional magnetic resonance imaging in an n-back working memory task 
      involving photographic face stimuli. The autism group showed reliably lower 
      activation compared with controls in the inferior left prefrontal area (involved in 
      verbal processing and working memory maintenance) and the right posterior temporal 
      area (associated with theory of mind processing). The participants with autism also 
      showed activation in a somewhat different location in the fusiform area than the 
      control participants. These results suggest that the neural circuitry of the brain 
      for face processing in autism may be analyzing the features of the face more as 
      objects and less in terms of their human significance. The functional connectivity 
      results revealed that the abnormal fusiform activation was embedded in a larger 
      context of smaller and less synchronized networks, particularly indicating lower 
      functional connectivity with frontal areas. In contrast to the underconnectivity 
      with frontal areas, the autism group showed no underconnectivity among posterior 
      cortical regions. These results extend previous findings of abnormal face perception 
      in autism by demonstrating that the abnormalities are embedded in an abnormal 
      cortical network that manages to perform the working memory task proficiently, using 
      a visually oriented, asocial processing style that minimizes reliance on prefrontal 
      areas.

AB  - In a previous study, we have shown that passive recognition of tactile geometrical 
      shapes (i.e. no exploratory movement) engages prefrontal and premotor areas in 
      addition to somatosensory regions (Savini et al., 2010). In the present study we 
      tested the hypothesis that these regions are involved not only in the perception but 
      also during working memory of such somatic information. We performed functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the execution of N-BACK tasks, with 2D 
      geometrical shapes blindly pressed on the subjects' right hand palm. Three 
      conditions with increasing memory load (0-BACK, 1-BACK, 2-BACK) were used. Results 
      showed that primary somatosensory area (SI), secondary somatosensory area (SII) and 
      bilateral Insula were active in all conditions, confirming their importance in 
      coding somatosensory stimuli. Activation of fronto-parietal circuit in supplementary 
      motor area (SMA), right superior parietal lobe (rSPL), bilateral middle frontal 
      gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus, and right superior frontal sulcus was 
      significantly larger during 1-BACK and 2-BACK than 0-BACK. Left superior parietal 
      lobe and right frontal eye field showed a higher activation during the 2-BACK than 
      0-BACK. Finally, SMA and rSPL were characterized by a statistically significant 
      higher activation during 2-BACK than 1-BACK, revealing their sensitivity to the 
      memory load. These results suggest that working memory of tactile geometrical shapes 
      (no exploratory movement) involves a complex circuit of modal and supramodal 
      fronto-parietal areas.

AB  - Individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) of developing psychosis present with 
      widespread functional abnormalities in the brain. Cognitive deficits, including 
      working memory (WM) problems, as commonly elicited by n-back tasks, are observed in 
      CHR individuals. However, functional MRI (fMRI) studies, comprising a heterogeneous 
      cluster of general and social cognition paradigms, have not necessarily demonstrated 
      consistent and conclusive results in this population. Hence, a comprehensive review 
      of fMRI studies, spanning almost one decade, was carried out to observe for general 
      trends with respect to brain regions and cognitive systems most likely to be 
      dysfunctional in CHR individuals. 32 studies were included for this review, out of 
      which 22 met the criteria for quantitative analysis using activation likelihood 
      estimation (ALE). Task related contrast activations were firstly analysed by 
      comparing CHR and healthy control participants in the total pooled sample, followed 
      by a comparison of general cognitive function studies (excluding social cognition 
      paradigms), and finally by only looking at n-back working memory task based studies. 
      Findings from the ALE implicated four key dysfunctional and distinct neural regions 
      in the CHR group, namely the right inferior parietal lobule (rIPL), the left medial 
      frontal gyrus (lmFG), the left superior temporal gyrus (lSTG) and the right 
      fronto-polar cortex (rFPC) of the superior frontal gyrus (SFG). Narrowing down to 
      relatively few significant dysfunctional neural regions is a step forward in 
      reducing the apparent ambiguity of overall findings, which would help to target 
      specific neural regions and pathways of interest for future research in CHR 
      populations.

TI  - Neural correlates of maintenance working memory, as well as relevant structural 
      qualities, are associated with earlier antiretroviral treatment initiation in 
      vertically transmitted HIV.
PG  - 60-69

AB  - There is evidence of HIV affecting cognitive functioning across age groups, with 
      adult studies showing related deficits in frontostriatal and hippocampal regional 
      activity. Additionally, delayed initiation of antiretroviral treatment (ART) has 
      been associated with poorer cognitive outcomes in HIV-infected youth. Little is 
      known, however, of the neural correlates underlying such cognitive deficits in youth 
      populations. We investigated maintenance working memory-related brain activity in 
      South African HIV-infected youth and controls, and the effect of ART initiation age 
      on underlying structures. Sixty-four perinatally infected youth (ages 9-12) and 20 
      controls (ages 9-13) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while 
      completing 1-back and 0-back blocks of the N-back task. At an uncorrected p value 
      threshold of 0.001, the HIV-infected group showed decreased activation in the left 
      superior temporal gyrus, pre- and postcentral gyri, insula, and putamen as well as 
      bilateral hippocampus, and mid cingulum. The HIV patients with delayed ART 
      initiation showed less activation during processing conditions in the mid cingulum; 
      left inferior parietal gyrus; and right inferior frontal, bilateral thalamic, and 
      superior temporal regions. When these regions were tested for structural 
      differences, the mid cingulum and right inferior frontal gyrus, insula, and thalamus 
      were found to have less cortical thickness, surface area, or volume in the group 
      with delayed ART initiation. Regional differences between HIV-infected youth and 
      controls noted in the N-back task are consistent with impairments in structures 
      involved in maintenance working memory. These data support earlier ART initiation in 
      perinatally infected individuals.

AB  - We examined whether altered connectivity in functional networks during working 
      memory performance persists following conclusion of that performance, into a 
      subsequent resting state. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
      in 50 young adults during an initial resting state, followed by an N-back working 
      memory task and a subsequent resting state, in order to examine changes in 
      functional connectivity within and between the default-mode network (DMN) and the 
      task-positive network (TPN) across the three states. We found that alterations in 
      connectivity observed during the N-back task persisted into the subsequent resting 
      state within the TPN and between the DMN and TPN, but not within the DMN. Further, 
      both speed of working memory performance and TPN connectivity strength during the 
      N-back task predicted connectivity strength in the subsequent resting state. 
      Finally, DMN connectivity measured before and during the N-back task predicted 
      individual differences in self-reported inattentiveness, but this association was 
      not found during the post-task resting state. Together, these findings have 
      important implications for models of how the brain recovers following effortful 
      cognition, as well as for experimental designs using resting and task scans.

TI  - The Effects of Working Memory Load on Auditory Distraction in Adults With Attention 
      Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.

AB  - Cognitive control provides us with the ability to inter alia, regulate the locus of 
      attention and ignore environmental distractions in accordance with our goals. 
      Auditory distraction is a frequently cited symptom in adults with attention deficit 
      hyperactivity disorder (aADHD)-yet few task-based fMRI studies have explored whether 
      deficits in cognitive control (associated with the disorder) impedes on the ability 
      to suppress/compensate for exogenously evoked cortical responses to noise in this 
      population. In the current study, we explored the effects of auditory distraction as 
      function of working memory (WM) load. Participants completed two tasks: an auditory 
      target detection (ATD) task in which the goal was to actively detect salient oddball 
      tones amidst a stream of standard tones in noise, and a visual n-back task 
      consisting of 0-, 1-, and 2-back WM conditions whilst concurrently ignoring the same 
      tonal signal from the ATD task. Results indicated that our sample of young aADHD (n 
      = 17), compared to typically developed controls (n = 17), had difficulty attenuating 
      auditory cortical responses to the task-irrelevant sound when WM demands were high 
      (2-back). Heightened auditory activity to task-irrelevant sound was associated with 
      both poorer WM performance and symptomatic inattentiveness. In the ATD task, we 
      observed a significant increase in functional communications between auditory and 
      salience networks in aADHD. Because performance outcomes were on par with controls 
      for this task, we suggest that this increased functional connectivity in aADHD was 
      likely an adaptive mechanism for suboptimal listening conditions. Taken together, 
      our results indicate that aADHD are more susceptible to noise interference when they 
      are engaged in a primary task. The ability to cope with auditory distraction appears 
      to be related to the WM demands of the task and thus the capacity to deploy 
      cognitive control.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Children with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) exhibit executive dysfunction 
      on traditional neuropsychological tests. However, there is limited evidence of 
      neural network alterations associated with this clinical executive dysfunction. The 
      objective of this study was to characterize working memory deficits in children with 
      TLE via activation of the executive control network on functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) and determine the relationships to fMRI behavioral findings and 
      traditional neuropsychological tests. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging was conducted on 17 children with TLE and 18 healthy control 
      participants (age 8-16 years) while they performed the N-back task in order to 
      assess activation of the executive control network. N-back accuracy, N-back reaction 
      time, and traditional neuropsychological tests (Delis-Kaplan Executive Function 
      System [D-KEFS] color-word interference and card-sort test) were also assessed. 
      PRINCIPAL OBSERVATIONS: Children with TLE exhibited executive dysfunction on D-KEFS 
      testing, reduced N-back accuracy, and increased N-back reaction time compared with 
      healthy controls; D-KEFS and N-back behavioral findings were significantly 
      correlated. Children with TLE also exhibited significant reduction in activation of 
      the frontal lobe within the executive control network compared to healthy controls. 
      These alterations were significantly correlated with N-back behavioral findings and 
      D-KEFS testing. CONCLUSIONS: Children with TLE exhibit executive dysfunction, which 
      correlates with executive control network alterations. This lends validity to the 
      theory that the executive control network contributes to working memory function. 
      The findings also indicate that children with TLE have network alterations in 
      nontemporal brain regions.

      Huntington's Disease: The IMAGE-HD Study.
PG  - 325-32
LID - 10.3233/JHD-150154 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric disturbances are common in Huntington's Disease (HD) 
      and have been observed in gene-positive individuals several years prior to the onset 
      of motor symptoms. The neural mechanism underpinning the development of 
      neuropsychiatric problems in HD remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether 
      neural activity during working memory is associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms 
      in premanifest Huntington's Disease. METHODS: functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) data from Pre-HD far from onset (pre-HDfar, n = 18), pre-HD close to onset 
      (pre-HDclose, n = 17), and controls (n = 32) were analysed. Correlations were 
      performed between fMRI activity in three regions of interest [bilateral dorsolateral 
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)] and neuropsychiatric 
      scores. RESULTS: In the pre-HDclose group, increased symptoms of obsessive 
      compulsion and depression were associated with decreased 
      blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI activity in the right DLPFC and ACC during 
      1-BACK and 2-BACK working memory conditions. In the pre-HDfar group increased 
      symptoms of depression was associated with decreased right DLPFC BOLD fMRI activity 
      during 2-BACK working memory only. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that 
      association between neuropsychiatric function and fMRI activity is more readily 
      detectable at higher working memory loads, and becomes more pronounced in those 
      closer to onset.

PG  - 476-83
LID - 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2012.01.008 [doi]
AB  - Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Bipolar Disorder (BPD) co-occur 
      frequently and represent a particularly morbid clinical form of both disorders, 
      however underlying neural circuitry contributing to the comorbidity remain 
      understudied. Our aim was to investigate functional brain circuitry during working 
      memory in a group of participants who meet criteria for both disorders (ADHD + BPD), 
      and to explore the relationship of symptoms of each disorder to brain function. We 
      used fMRI to image brain activity in 18 male adults with both ADHD and BPD, and 18 
      healthy control participants matched one-to-one on age, sex, and handedness, while 
      they performed a sequential letter N-back task. We investigated differences in 
      activation between these groups, and also correlations of brain activity during the 
      task to symptoms of ADHD and BPD independently. We found significant hypoactivity in 
      the subjects with ADHD + BPD vs. controls across frontal and parietal regions, and 
      further, found that BPD and ADHD symptoms related to activity in anatomically 
      distinct regions that were respectively characterized by activation and suppression 
      during task. We conclude that comorbid ADHD + BPD is associated with alterations 
      across anterior and posterior nodes of the working memory network, and symptoms of 
      each disorder are related to anatomically and functionally distinct brain regions.

AB  - The combination of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can provide original data to investigate 
      age-related brain changes. We examined neural activity modulations induced by two 
      multifocal tDCS procedures based on two distinct montages fitting two N-back 
      task-based fMRI patterns ("compensatory" and "maintenance") related to high working 
      memory (WM) in a previous publication (Fernández-Cabello et al. Neurobiol Aging 
      (2016);48:23-33). We included 24 participants classified as stable or decliners 
      according to their 4-year WM trajectories following a retrospective longitudinal 
      approach. Then, we studied longitudinal fMRI differences between groups (stable and 
      decliners) and across multifocal tDCS montages ("compensatory" and "maintenance") 
      applied using a single-blind sham-controlled cross-over design. Decliners evidenced 
      over-activation of non-related WM areas after 4 years of follow-up. Focusing on tDCS 
      effects, among the decliner group, the "compensatory"-tDCS montage reduced the 
      activity over the posterior regions where these subjects showed longitudinal 
      hyperactivation. These results reinforce the notion that tDCS effects are 
      characterized by an activity reduction and might be more noticeable in compromised 
      systems. Importantly, the data provide novel evidence that cognitive trajectories 
      predict tDCS effects in older adults.

AB  - In traditional fMRI, individuals respond to exogenous stimuli and are naïve to the 
      effects of the stimuli on their neural activity patterns. Changes arising in the 
      fMRI signal are analyzed post-hoc to elucidate the spatial and temporal activation 
      of brain regions associated with the tasks performed. The advent of real-time fMRI 
      has enabled a new method to systematically alter brain activity across space and 
      time using neurofeedback training (NFT), providing a new tool to study 
      internally-driven processes such as neuroplasticity. In this work, we combined 
      n-back practice with fMRI-NFT of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to 
      better understand the relationship between open- and closed-loop neuromodulation. 
      FMRI data were acquired during both traditional n-back and NFT across five imaging 
      sessions. Region-of-interest (ROI) and voxel-wise 2 × 2 within subjects ANOVAs were 
      carried out to determine the effects of, and interaction between, training session 
      and neuromodulation type. A main effect of training session was identified for only 
      a single, highly focused cluster that shared spatial properties with the fMRI-NFT 
      target region (left DLPFC). This finding indicates that combined open- and 
      closed-loop neuroplastic enhancement techniques result in focal changes that are 
      confined to the target area of NFT, and do not affect up- or down-stream network 
      components that are normally engaged during working memory. Additionally, we 
      identified a main effect of neuromodulation type for 15 clusters with significantly 
      different activation between open- and closed-loop neuromodulation during training, 
      12 of which demonstrated higher activity during the open-loop neuromodulation. Our 
      results, taken together with previous reports, indicate that fMRI-NFT combined with 
      n-back practice leads to a highly focal volume exhibiting neuroplasticity without 
      additional network effects.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Visuospatial working memory impairments have been implicated in the 
      pathophysiology of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, most 
      ADHD research has focused on the neural correlates of nonspatial mnemonic processes. 
      This study examined brain activation and functional connectivity for visuospatial 
      working memory in youth with and without ADHD. METHOD: Twenty-four youth with ADHD 
      and 21 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were scanned with functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging while performing an N-back test of working memory for spatial 
      position. Block-design analyses contrasted activation and functional connectivity 
      separately for high (2-back) and low (1-back) working memory load conditions versus 
      the control condition (0-back). The effect of working memory load was modeled with 
      linear contrasts. RESULTS: The 2 groups performed comparably on the task and 
      demonstrated similar patterns of frontoparietal activation, with no differences in 
      linear gains in activation as working memory load increased. However, youth with 
      ADHD showed greater activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) 
      and left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), greater functional connectivity between 
      the left DLPFC and left intraparietal sulcus, and reduced left DLPFC connectivity 
      with left midcingulate cortex and PCC for the high load contrast compared to 
      controls (p < .01; k > 100 voxels). Reanalysis using a more conservative statistical 
      approach (p < .001; k > 100 voxels) yielded group differences in PCC activation and 
      DLPFC-midcingulate connectivity. CONCLUSION: Youth with ADHD show decreased 
      efficiency of DLPFC for high-load visuospatial working memory and greater reliance 
      on posterior spatial attention circuits to store and update spatial position than 
      healthy control youth. Findings should be replicated in larger samples.

TI  - Effect of mGluR2 positive allosteric modulation on frontostriatal working memory 
      activation in schizophrenia.
LID - 10.1038/s41380-021-01320-w [doi]
AB  - Negative symptoms and cognitive deficits contribute strongly to disability in 
      schizophrenia, and are resistant to existing medications. Recent drug development 
      has targeted enhanced NMDA function by increasing mGluR2/3 signaling. However, the 
      clinical utility of such agents remains uncertain, and markers of brain circuit 
      function are critical for clarifying mechanisms and understanding individual 
      differences in efficacy. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized 
      cross-over (14 day washout) pilot study evaluating adjunctive use of the mGluR2 
      positive allosteric modulator AZD8529 (80 mg daily for 3 days), in chronic stable 
      patients with schizophrenia (n = 26 analyzed). We focused on 3 T fMRI response in 
      frontostriatal regions during an n-back working memory task, testing the hypothesis 
      that AZD8529 produces fMRI changes that correlate with improvement in negative 
      symptoms and cognition. We found that AZD8529 did not produce significant 
      group-average effects on symptoms or cognitive accuracy. However, AZD8529 did 
      increase n-back fMRI activation in striatum (p < 0.0001) and anterior 
      cingulate/paracingulate (p = 0.002). Greater drug-versus-placebo effects on caudate 
      activation significantly correlated with greater reductions in PANSS negative 
      symptom scores (r = -0.42, p = 0.031), and exploratory correlations suggested 
      broader effects across multiple symptom domains and regions of interest. These 
      findings demonstrate that fMRI responses to mGluR2 positive modulation relate to 
      individual differences in symptom reduction, and could be pursued for future 
      biomarker development. Negative clinical results at the group level should not lead 
      to premature termination of investigation of this mechanism, which may benefit an 
      important subset of individuals with schizophrenia. Imaging biomarkers may reveal 
      therapeutic mechanisms, and help guide treatment toward specific populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a common symptom in the patients with 
      Parkinson's disease (PD). The characteristics of cognitive impairment in PD are 
      executive function (including working memory) and visuo-perceptual processing. The 
      visuospatial n-back test has the merit of minimizing the influence of educational 
      biases involved in the verbal n-back test. Furthermore, it can assess both 
      visuospatial recognition and working memory in a single test. METHODS: We aimed to 
      clarify the advantage of the visuospatial n-back test as a tool for detecting 
      impairments of working memory in PD. We enrolled 28 right-handed patients with PD 
      (18 males, 10 females) and 12 age-matched healthy controls (HC; 7 males, 5 females). 
      Thirteen patients were classified as MCI (PD-MCI), and 15 as cognitively normal PD 
      (PD-CN). Using functional MRI (fMRI), we explored the specific brain regions 
      associated with the performance of the n-back test in the PD-MCI, PD-CN, and HC 
      groups. The 0-back test assesses visuospatial recognition, while the 1-back and 
      2-back tests assess visuospatial working memory. Group comparisons were performed 
      for three loads of this test. RESULTS: Patients with PD performed significantly 
      worse in terms of the correct answer rates of all n-back tests compared with HC. 
      fMRI analyses performed during the 2-back test revealed reduced activation in the 
      bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and parietal 
      lobule in the PD group compared with the HC group. In contrast, the fMRI result 
      during the 0-back test showed only a marginal difference in the frontal lobe. On 
      comparisons of task performance between the PD-MCI and PD-CN groups, we found that 
      the correct answer rate in the 2-back test was lower in the PD-MCI group than in the 
      PD-CN group. However, scores of the 0-back and 1-back tests were not significantly 
      different between the two groups. The fMRI findings revealed that activations within 
      the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) during the 2-back 
      test were reduced in the patients with PD-MCI when compared to those with PD-CN. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study reports reduced activation of the MFG and IPL in patients 
      with PD-MCI. These regions may be associated with the pathophysiology of working 
      memory impairment in patients with PD, which involves fronto-striatal network 
      dysfunction.

TI  - Working-memory fMRI reveals cingulate hyperactivation in euthymic major depression.
PG  - 2746-56
LID - 10.1002/hbm.20702 [doi]
AB  - While cognitive impairments are well documented for the acute episode of major 
      depressive disorder (MDD), less is known about cognitive functioning in the euthymic 
      state. For working memory, dysfunctional activation of lateral prefrontal and 
      cingulate cortex has been reported in the acute episode. This study investigates 
      working-memory function and its neurobiological correlate in euthymic MDD patients, 
      particularly whether dysfunctional activation persists when depressive symptoms 
      improve. We investigated 56 subjects with functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) at 3 Tesla. To challenge working-memory function, a classical verbal n-back 
      task (0-, 1-, and 2-back) was used in 28 well-characterized, euthymic, unipolar MDD 
      patients and 28 healthy control subjects matched according to age, sex, and 
      educational level. Data were analyzed using SPM5. In the absence of significant 
      behavioral differences, we observed comparable overall patterns of brain activation 
      in both groups. As expected, both groups showed stronger activation of the typical 
      working-memory network with increasing memory load. However, significant 
      hyperactivation of the cingulate cortex was observed in euthymic patients, while 
      lateral prefrontal activation was comparable between patients and controls. 
      Working-memory challenge in the euthymic state of MDD revealed a dissociation of 
      lateral prefrontal and cingulate brain function. Cingulate function, which is 
      important for both emotional and cognitive processing and their integration, is 
      still abnormal when mood is restored. This could reflect a different speed of 
      normalization in prefrontal and limbic cortices, persistent systematic changes in 
      neuronal networks after an episode of MDD, or a compensatory mechanism to maintain 
      working-memory performance.

TI  - Neuronal underpinnings of cognitive impairment in bipolar disorder: A large 
      data-driven functional magnetic resonance imaging study.
PG  - 69-81
LID - 10.1111/bdi.13100 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Cognitive impairment occurs in approximately 50% of remitted patients 
      with bipolar disorder (BD). However, there exists no treatment with replicated and 
      robust efficacy on cognition in BD. This is partially due to limited insight into 
      the neuronal underpinnings of cognitive impairment in these patients. This is the 
      first study to investigate neuronal underpinnings of cognitive impairment in a large 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset comparing neural activity 
      patterns between distinct neurocognitive subgroups of partially or fully remitted 
      patients with BD. METHODS: Patients (n = 153) and healthy controls (HC) (n = 52) 
      underwent neuropsychological assessment and fMRI, during which they performed a 
      verbal N-back working memory (WM) task. Based on hierarchical cluster analysis of 
      neuropsychological test performance, patients were grouped into one of two 
      neurocognitive subgroups (cognitively impaired, n = 91; cognitively normal compared 
      to HC, n = 62) that were compared on WM-related neural activity. RESULTS: 
      Cognitively impaired patients displayed WM-related hypo-activity in left 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and frontal and parietal regions within a cognitive 
      control network (CCN) as well as hyper-activity in the default mode network (DMN) 
      compared to cognitively normal patients. In contrast, cognitively normal patients 
      only exhibited hypo-activity within a small cluster in the superior frontal gyrus 
      relative to HC. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairment in BD seems to originate from a 
      failure to recruit key regions in the CCN and to suppress task-irrelevant DMN 
      activity during cognitive performance. These results highlight modulation of 
      aberrant dorsal prefrontal and DMN activity as a putative target for pro-cognitive 
      treatment in BD.

TI  - Detecting the Inverted-U in fMRI Studies of Schizophrenia: A Comparison of Three 
      Analysis Methods.
PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1017/S1355617721000424 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cognitive tasks are used to probe neuronal activity during functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to detect signs of aberrant cognitive functioning 
      in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (SZ). However, nonlinear 
      (inverted-U-shaped) associations between neuronal activity and task difficulty can 
      lead to misinterpretation of group differences between patients and healthy 
      comparison subjects (HCs). In this paper, we evaluated a novel method for correcting 
      these misinterpretations based on conditional performance analysis. METHOD: 
      Participants included 25 HCs and 27 SZs who performed a working memory (WM) task 
      (N-back) with 5 load conditions while undergoing fMRI. Neuronal activity was 
      regressed onto: 1) task load (i.e., parametric task levels), 2) marginal task 
      performance (i.e., performance averaged over all load conditions), or 3) conditional 
      task performance (i.e., performance within each load condition). RESULTS: In most 
      regions of interest, conditional performance analysis uniquely revealed 
      inverted-U-shaped neuronal activity in both SZs and HCs. After accounting for 
      conditional performance differences between groups, we observed few difference in 
      both the pattern and level of neuronal activity between SZs and HCs within regions 
      that are classically associated with WM functioning (e.g., posterior dorsolateral 
      prefrontal and parietal association cortices). However, SZs did show aberrant 
      activity within the anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Interpretations of differences in neuronal activity between groups, and of 
      associations between neuronal activity and performance, should be considered within 
      the context of task performance. Whether conditional performance-based differences 
      reflect compensation, dedifferentiation, or other processes is not a question that 
      is easily resolved by examining activation and performance data alone.

TI  - No gender differences in brain activation during the N-back task: an fMRI study in 
      healthy individuals.
PG  - 3609-15
LID - 10.1002/hbm.20783 [doi]
AB  - Gender differences have been well established in verbal and spatial abilities but 
      few studies have examined if these differences also extend into the domain of 
      working memory in terms of behavioural differences and brain activation. The 
      conclusions that can be drawn from these studies are not clear cut but suggest that 
      even though gender differences might not be apparent from behavioural measures, the 
      underlying neural substrate associated with working memory might be different in men 
      and women. Previous research suggests activation in a network of frontal and 
      parietal regions during working memory tasks. This study aimed to investigate gender 
      differences in patterns of brain activation during a verbal version of the N-back 
      working memory task, which incorporates the effects of increased demands on working 
      memory. A total of 50 healthy subjects, aged 18 to 58 years, that were equally split 
      by gender were recruited matched for age, levels of education and ethnicity. All 
      subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found that men and 
      women performed equally well in terms of accuracy and response times, while using 
      similar brain regions to the same degree. Our observations indicate that verbal 
      working memory is not affected by gender at the behavioural or neural level, and 
      support the findings of a recent meta-analysis by Hyde ([ 2005]: Sex Roles 
      53:717-725) that gender differences are generally smaller than intra-gender 
      differences in many cognitive domains.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Using a block-designed BOLD-fMRI to explore the neural basis of spatial 
      working memory impairment in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) 
      performing an n-back task. METHODS: Sixteen patients with SCH before and after being 
      treated with levothyroxine (LT4) for 6 months and 16 matched euthyroid subjects were 
      scanned by fMRI under the n-back task. RESULTS: The fMRI scan found that a neural 
      network consisting of bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), bilateral 
      premotor area (PreMA), supplementary motor area/anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral 
      parietal lobe (PA) and right caudate nucleus/thalamus was activated, with right 
      hemisphere dominance. In euthyroid subjects, all these regions of interest (ROIs) 
      showed load effect; however, only left DLPFC, left PA, bilateral PreMA and right 
      caudate nucleus/thalamus showed the same effect in Pre-SCH patients. Furthermore, 
      activation intensities of most ROIs (especially DLPFC and right PA) for Pre-SCH 
      patients were lower than those in the euthyroid subjects (F <3.046, p > 0.062). 
      Importantly, after a 6-month treatment with LT4, the load effect in SCH patients 
      appeared the same as in the euthyroid subjects in all the ROIs (F >13.176, p < 
      0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our previous study shows that verbal working memory of SCH 
      patients is impaired with abnormal activity in bilateral frontal areas. In this 
      study, the results indicated that SCH patients may also have spatial working memory 
      impairments, and the altered activities of right DLPFC and right posterior parietal 
      lobe may be one of the underlying neural mechanisms. Most importantly, this study 
      shows that LT4 replacement therapy can improve the memory impairment and reverse the 
      altered neural activity network.

AB  - Changes in large-scale brain networks that accompany mild traumatic brain injury 
      (mTBI) were investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during 
      the N-back working memory task at two cognitive loads (1-back and 2-back). Thirty 
      mTBI patients were examined during the chronic stage of injury and compared to 28 
      control participants. Demographics and behavioral performance were matched across 
      groups. Due to the diffuse nature of injury, we hypothesized that there would be an 
      imbalance in the communication between task-positive and Default Mode Network (DMN) 
      regions in the context of effortful task execution. Specifically, a graph-theoretic 
      measure of modularity was used to quantify the extent to which groups of brain 
      regions tended to segregate into task-positive and DMN sub-networks. Relative to 
      controls, mTBI patients showed reduced segregation between the DMN and task-positive 
      networks, but increased functional connectivity within the DMN regions during the 
      more cognitively demanding 2-back task. Together, our findings reveal that patients 
      exhibit alterations in the communication between and within neural networks during a 
      cognitively demanding task. These findings reveal altered processes that persist 
      through the chronic stage of injury, highlighting the need for longitudinal research 
      to map the neural recovery of mTBI patients.

TI  - Structural correlates of impaired working memory in hippocampal sclerosis.
PG  - 1143-53
LID - 10.1111/epi.12193 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) has been considered to impair long-term 
      memory, whilst not affecting working memory, but recent evidence suggests that 
      working memory is compromised. Functional MRI (fMRI) studies demonstrate that 
      working memory involves a bilateral frontoparietal network the activation of which 
      is disrupted in hippocampal sclerosis (HS). A specific role of the hippocampus to 
      deactivate during working memory has been proposed with this mechanism faulty in 
      patients with HS. Structural correlates of disrupted working memory in HS have not 
      been explored. METHODS: We studied 54 individuals with medically refractory TLE and 
      unilateral HS (29 left) and 28 healthy controls. Subjects underwent 3T structural 
      MRI, a visuospatial n-back fMRI paradigm and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Working 
      memory capacity assessed by three span tasks (digit span backwards, gesture span, 
      motor sequences) was combined with performance in the visuospatial paradigm to give 
      a global working memory measure. Gray and white matter changes were investigated 
      using voxel-based morphometry and voxel-based analysis of DTI, respectively. KEY 
      FINDINGS: Individuals with left or right HS performed less well than healthy 
      controls on all measures of working memory. fMRI demonstrated a bilateral 
      frontoparietal network during the working memory task with reduced activation of the 
      right parietal lobe in both patient groups. In left HS, gray matter loss was seen in 
      the ipsilateral hippocampus and parietal lobe, with maintenance of the gray matter 
      volume of the contralateral parietal lobe associated with better performance. White 
      matter integrity within the frontoparietal network, in particular the superior 
      longitudinal fasciculus and cingulum, and the contralateral temporal lobe, was 
      associated with working memory performance. In right HS, gray matter loss was also 
      seen in the ipsilateral hippocampus and parietal lobe. Working memory performance 
      correlated with the gray matter volume of both frontal lobes and white matter 
      integrity within the frontoparietal network and contralateral temporal lobe. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: Our data provide further evidence that working memory is disrupted in 
      HS and impaired integrity of both gray and white matter is seen in functionally 
      relevant areas. We suggest this forms the structural basis of the impairment of 
      working memory, indicating widespread and functionally significant structural 
      changes in patients with apparently isolated HS.

      memory performance in younger adults.
PG  - 7959-7973
LID - 10.1111/ejn.15532 [doi]
AB  - Brain iron affects working memory (WM) but the impact of iron content in deep grey 
      matter nuclei on WM networks is unknown. We aimed to test whether deep grey matter 
      nuclei iron concentration can affect resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) 
      within brain networks modifying WM performance. An N-back WM paradigm was applied in 
      a hundred healthy younger adults. The participants then underwent a resting-state 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for brain network analysis and 
      quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) imaging for assessment of deep grey matter 
      nuclei iron concentration. Higher substantia nigra (SN) iron concentration was 
      associated with lower rsFC between SN and brain regions of the temporal/frontal lobe 
      but with better WM performance after controlling for age, gender and education. A 
      follow-up mediation analysis also indicated that functional connectivity may mediate 
      the link between SN iron and WM performance. Our results suggest that high SN iron 
      concentration may affect communication between the SN and temporal/frontal lobe and 
      is associated with strengthened WM performance in younger adults.

TI  - Involvement of the cerebellar cortex and nuclei in verbal and visuospatial working 
      memory: a 7 T fMRI study.
PG  - 1537-50
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.05.037 [doi]
AB  - The first aim of the present study was to extend previous findings of similar 
      cerebellar cortical areas being involved in verbal and spatial n-back working memory 
      to the level of the cerebellar nuclei. The second aim was to investigate whether 
      different areas of the cerebellar cortex and nuclei contribute to different working 
      memory tasks (n-back vs. Sternberg tasks). Young and healthy subjects participated 
      in two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies using a 7 T MR scanner 
      with its increased signal-to-noise ratio. One group of subjects (n=21) performed an 
      abstract and a verbal version of an n-back task contrasting a 2-back and 0-back 
      condition. Another group of subjects (n=23) performed an abstract and a verbal 
      version of a Sternberg task contrasting a high load and a low load condition. A 
      block design was used. For image processing of the dentate nuclei, a recently 
      developed region of interest (ROI) driven normalization method of the dentate nuclei 
      was applied (Diedrichsen et al., 2011). Whereas activated areas of the cerebellar 
      cortex and dentate nuclei were not significantly different comparing the abstract 
      and verbal versions of the n-back task, activation in the abstract and verbal 
      Sternberg tasks was significantly different. In both n-back tasks activation was 
      most prominent at the border of lobules VI and Crus I, within lobule VII, and within 
      the more caudal parts of the dentate nucleus bilaterally. In Sternberg tasks the 
      most prominent activations were found in lobule VI extending into Crus I on the 
      right. In the verbal Sternberg task activation was significantly larger within right 
      lobule VI compared to the abstract Sternberg task and compared to the verbal n-back 
      task. Activations of rostral parts of the dentate were most prominent in the verbal 
      Sternberg task, whereas activation of caudal parts predominated in the abstract 
      Sternberg task. On the one hand, the lack of difference between abstract and verbal 
      n-back tasks and the lack of significant lateralization suggest a more general 
      contribution of the cerebellum to working memory regardless of the modality. On the 
      other hand, the focus of activation in right lobule VI in the verbal Sternberg task 
      suggests specific cerebellar contributions to verbal working memory. The verbal 
      Sternberg task emphasizes maintenance of stimuli via phonological rehearsal, whereas 
      central executive demands prevail in n-back tasks. Based on the model of working 
      memory by Baddeley and Hitch (1974), the present results show that different regions 
      of the cerebellum support functions of the central executive system and one of the 
      subsidiary systems, the phonological loop.

      memory functional magnetic resonance imaging study.

AB  - Although two thirds of patients with a cocaine use disorder (CUD) are female, little 
      is known about sex differences in the (neuro)pathology of CUD. The aim of this 
      explorative study was to investigate sex-dependent differences in prefrontal cortex 
      (PFC) functioning during a working memory (WM) functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) task in regular cocaine users (CUs), as PFC deficits are implicated in the 
      shift from recreational cocaine use to CUD. Neural activation was measured using 
      fMRI during a standard WM task (n-back task) in 27 male and 28 female CUs and in 26 
      male and 28 female non-cocaine users (non-CUs). Although there were no main or 
      interaction effects of sex and group on n-back task performance, WM-related 
      (2-back > 0-back) PFC functioning was significantly moderated by sex and group: 
      female compared with male CUs displayed higher WM-related activation of the middle 
      frontal gyrus (MFG), whereas female compared with male non-CUs displayed lower 
      WM-related MFG activation. Additionally, WM-related activation of the inferior 
      frontal gyrus, insula, and putamen was negatively associated with cocaine use 
      severity in female but not male CUs. These data support the hypothesis of 
      sex-dependent PFC differences in CUs and speculatively suggest that PFC deficits may 
      be more strongly implicated in the development, continuation, and possibly treatment 
      of CUD in females. Most importantly, the current data stress the importance of 
      studying both males and females in psychiatry research as not doing so could greatly 
      bias our knowledge of CUD and other psychiatric disorders.

TI  - Spatial Working Memory Impairment in Patients with Non-neuropsychiatric Systemic 
      Lupus Erythematosus: A Blood-oxygen-level Dependent Functional Magnetic Resonance 
      Imaging Study.
PG  - 201-208
LID - 10.3899/jrheum.160290 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Using ethology and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to 
      explore mild cognitive dysfunction and spatial working memory (WM) impairment in 
      patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) without overt neuropsychiatric 
      symptoms (non-NPSLE) and to study whether any clinical biomarkers could serve as 
      predictors of brain dysfunction in this disease. METHODS: Eighteen non-NPSLE 
      patients and 18 matched subjects were all tested using the Montreal cognitive 
      assessment scale test and scanned using blood-oxygen-level dependent fMRI while 
      performing the n-back task to investigate the activation intensity of some 
      cognition-related areas. RESULTS: Ethology results showed that non-NPSLE patients 
      had mild cognitive dysfunction and memory dysfunction (p < 0.05). The fMRI scan 
      confirmed a neural network consisting of bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
      (DLPFC), premotor area, parietal lobe, and supplementary motor area (SMA)/anterior 
      cingulate cortex (ACC) that was activated during the n-back task, with right 
      hemisphere dominance. However, only the right SMA/ACC showed a load effect in the 
      non-NPSLE group; the activation intensity of most WM-related brain areas for the 
      non-NPSLE group was lower than for the control group under 3 memory loads. Further, 
      we found that the activation intensity of some cognition-related areas, including 
      the bilateral caudate nucleus/insula and hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus were 
      lower than the control group under the memory loads. An inverse correlation existed 
      between individual activation intensity and disease duration. CONCLUSION: 
      Non-NPSLE-related brain damage with right DLPFC-posterior parietal lobe and 
      parahippocampal gyrus default network causes impairment of spatial WM and mild 
      cognitive dysfunction. Patients with longer disease duration would be expected to 
      exhibit increased central nervous system damage.

TI  - Occupational solvent exposure and brain function: an fMRI study.
PG  - 908-13
LID - 10.1289/ehp.1002529 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Deficits in cognitive function have been demonstrated among workers 
      chronically exposed to solvents, but the neural basis for these deficits has not 
      been shown. OBJECTIVES: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to 
      compare pathophysiological changes in brain function between solvent-exposed and 
      control workers. METHODS: Painters, drywall tapers, and carpenters were recruited 
      from the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, District Council 9 in 
      New York City and District Council 21 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and from the 
      Carpenters Union in New Jersey. Twenty-seven solvent-exposed and 27 control subjects 
      of similar age, education, and occupational status completed the N-Back working 
      memory test during fMRI. After controlling for confounders (age; lifetime marijuana, 
      cocaine, and alcohol use; blood lead; symptoms of depression; verbal intelligence), 
      voxelwise group analysis and regional activation levels were compared and then 
      correlated with an index of lifetime solvent exposure. RESULTS: Solvent-exposed 
      workers' performance on the N-Back was significantly worse than that of controls. 
      Activation of the anterior cingulate, prefrontal, and parietal cortices--areas 
      serving working memory function and attention--was also significantly lower for 
      solvent-exposed workers relative to controls. After controlling for confounders, we 
      observed a negative correlation between lifetime solvent exposure and activation in 
      these same regions among the solvent-exposed workers. CONCLUSIONS: This study is one 
      of the few to document neural structures affected by exposure to solvents. Our 
      findings provide a biological mechanism for the neurobehavioral deficits in working 
      memory and attention that have previously been reported by other groups studying the 
      effects of chronic exposure to solvents. These imaging markers, which are consistent 
      with the neurobehavioral measures in our subject population, are consistent with 
      altered brain pathology caused by prolonged exposure to solvent mixtures during 
      construction work.

AB  - Working memory for sound identity (What) and sound location (Where) has been 
      associated with increased neural activity in ventral and dorsal brain regions, 
      respectively. To further ascertain this domain specificity, we measured fMRI signals 
      during an n-back (n=1, 2) working memory task for sound identity or location, where 
      stimuli selected randomly from three semantic categories (human, animal, and music) 
      were presented at three possible virtual locations. Accuracy and reaction times were 
      comparable in both "What" and "Where" tasks, albeit worse for the 2-back than for 
      the 1-back condition. The analysis of fMRI data revealed greater activity in ventral 
      and dorsal brain regions during sound identity and sound location, respectively. 
      More importantly, there was an interaction between task and working memory load in 
      the inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Within the right IPL, there were two sub-regions 
      modulated differentially by working memory load: an anterior ventromedial region 
      modulated by location load and a posterior dorsolateral region modulated by category 
      load. These specific changes in neural activity as a function of working memory load 
      reveal domain-specificity within the parietal cortex.

AB  - The comprehensive relations between healthy adult human brain white matter (WM) 
      microstructure and gray matter (GM) function, and their joint relations to cognitive 
      performance, remain poorly understood. We investigated these associations in 27 
      younger and 28 older healthy adults by linking diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected during an n-back working 
      memory task. We present a novel application of multivariate Partial Least Squares 
      (PLS) analysis that permitted the simultaneous modeling of relations between WM 
      integrity values from all major WM tracts and patterns of condition-related BOLD 
      signal across all GM regions. Our results indicate that greater microstructural 
      integrity of the major WM tracts was negatively related to condition-related blood 
      oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal in task-positive GM regions. This negative 
      relationship suggests that better quality of structural connections allows for more 
      efficient use of task-related GM processing resources. Individuals with more intact 
      WM further showed greater BOLD signal increases in typical "task-negative" regions 
      during fixation, and notably exhibited a balanced magnitude of BOLD response across 
      task-positive and -negative states. Structure-function relations also predicted task 
      performance, including accuracy and speed of responding. Finally, 
      structure-function-behavior relations reflected individual differences over and 
      above chronological age. Our findings provide evidence for the role of WM 
      microstructure as a scaffold for the context-relevant utilization of GM regions.

AB  - Women with ovarian cancer often undergo chemotherapy involving multiple agents. 
      However, little is known about treatment-related central neurotoxicity in this 
      population. The goal of this cross-sectional study was to assess brain structure and 
      function and neurocognitive abilities in patients with ovarian cancer following 
      first-line chemotherapy. Eighteen patients with ovarian, peritoneal and fallopian 
      tube cancer and eighteen healthy controls matched for gender, age and education 
      participated in the study. The patients were evaluated 1-4 months following 
      completion of first-line taxane/platinum chemotherapy. All participants underwent 
      structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and completed 
      neuropsychological tests of attention, memory and executive functions. Neuroimaging 
      assessments included voxel-based morphometry (VBM) for measuring gray matter (GM) 
      volume, and functional MRI (fMRI) during the N-back working memory task. The results 
      of VBM showed that patients had significantly reduced GM volume compared to healthy 
      controls in the right middle/superior frontal gyrus, and in the left supramarginal 
      gyrus and left inferior parietal lobule. fMRI results indicated significantly 
      decreased activation in patients relative to healthy controls in the left middle 
      frontal gyrus and left inferior parietal lobule during the N-back task (1/2/3-back 
      >0-back). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups 
      on the neuropsychological tests. This is the first study showing structural and 
      functional alterations involving frontal and parietal regions in patients with 
      ovarian cancer treated with first-line chemotherapy. These findings are congruent 
      with studies involving women with breast cancer, and provide additional supporting 
      evidence for central neurotoxicity associated with taxane/platinum chemotherapy.

AB  - The cerebellum plays an important role in cognitive functions through connecting 
      with the cerebral cortical areas. However, the relationship between the 
      resting-state functional connectivity (FC) pattern of human cerebro-cerebellar 
      circuits and cognition is not fully understood. The present study investigated the 
      FC patterns of human cerebro-cerebellar circuits and their associations with verbal 
      working memory performance (an n-back task with three subtasks: 0-back, 1-back, and 
      2-back) through resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 
      34 healthy subjects. The whole-brain connectivity analysis was used to identify the 
      cortical hubs as regions of interest (ROI). Then ROI-based FC analysis was performed 
      to investigate the connectivity characteristics within the key cortical hubs and 
      their associations with n-back task performance. The results showed that the 
      bilateral cerebellum lobule VI as central hubs had increased FC with the default 
      mode network (DMN) node (e.g., right posterior cingulate cortex) and salient network 
      (SN) node (e.g., right anterior cingulate cortex), while decreased FC with the 
      executive control network (ECN) node (e.g., the bilateral superior frontal gyrus). 
      Furthermore, FC values of the cerebellum lobule VI with DMN and ECN nodes correlated 
      with verbal working memory performance (response time of 2-back task). The results 
      suggest that the cerebro-cerebellar circuits involve the underlying neural basis of 
      verbal working memory processing during the resting state.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: While widespread cortical and subcortical brain functional abnormalities 
      have been found in bipolar disorder, the changes that take place between illness 
      phases and recovery are less clearly documented. Only a small number of longitudinal 
      studies of manic patients, in particular, have been carried out. METHODS: Twenty-six 
      bipolar patients underwent fMRI during performance of the n-back working memory task 
      when manic and again after recovery. Twenty-six matched healthy controls were also 
      scanned on two occasions. Task-related activations and de-activations were examined. 
      RESULTS: When manic, the patients showed clusters of significantly reduced 
      activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)/precentral cortex and 
      the parietal cortex/superior precuneus bilaterally. They also showed failure of 
      de-activation in the ventromedial frontal cortex (vmPFC). After recovery, activation 
      in the left DLPFC/precentral cortex and in the bilateral parietal cortex/superior 
      precuneus clusters increased significantly. However, failure of de-activation 
      remained present in the vmPFC. CONCLUSIONS: Recovery from mania is associated with 
      normalization of DLPFC and parietal hypoactivation, but not with vmPFC failure of 
      de-activation, which accordingly appears to represent a trait abnormality in the 
      disorder.

TI  - Brain activity is contingent on neuropsychological function in a functional magnetic

PG  - 3051-3060
LID - 10.1111/ene.14957 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating 
      neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive degeneration of neurons in motor 
      and non-motor brain regions, affecting multiple cognitive domains such as memory. A 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was performed to explore working 
      memory function in ALS. METHODS: To contribute to the growing research field that 
      employs structural and functional neuroimaging to investigate the effect of ALS on 
      different working memory components, the localization and intensity of alterations 
      in neural activity was explored using fMRI. Being the first study to specifically 
      address verbal working memory via fMRI in the context of ALS, the verbal n-back task 
      with 0-back and 2-back conditions was employed. RESULTS: Despite ALS patients 
      showing unimpaired accuracies (p = 0.724) and reaction times (p = 0.0785), there was 
      significantly increased brain activity of frontotemporal and parietal regions in the 
      2-back minus 0-back contrast in patients compared to controls (using nonparametric 
      statistics with 5000 permutations and a T threshold of 2.5). DISCUSSION: Increased 
      brain activity of the frontotemporal and parietal regions during working memory 
      performance was largely associated with better neuropsychological function within 
      the ALS group, suggesting a compensatory effect during working memory execution. 
      This study therefore adds to the current knowledge on neural correlates of working 
      memory in ALS and contributes to a more nuanced understanding of hyperactivity 
      during cognitive processes in fMRI studies of ALS.

TI  - The neural basis of hot and cold cognition in depressed patients, unaffected 
      relatives, and low-risk healthy controls: An fMRI investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Modern cognitive neuropsychological models of depression posit that 
      negatively biased emotional ("hot") processing confers risk for depression, while 
      preserved executive function ("cold") cognition promotes resilience. METHODS: We 
      compared neural responses during hot and cold cognitive tasks in 99 individuals: 
      those at familial risk for depression (N = 30 unaffected first-degree relatives of 
      depressed individuals) and those currently experiencing a major depressive episode 
      (N = 39 unmedicated depressed patients) with low-risk healthy controls (N = 30). 
      Primary analyses assessed neural activation on two functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging tasks previously associated with depression: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
      (DLPFC) responsivity during the n-back working memory task; and amygdala and 
      subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) responsivity during incidental emotional 
      face processing. RESULTS: Depressed patients exhibited significantly attenuated 
      working memory-related DLPFC activation, compared to low-risk controls and 
      unaffected relatives; unaffected relatives did not differ from low-risk controls. We 
      did not observe a complementary pattern during emotion processing. However, we found 
      preliminary support that greater DLPFC activation was associated with lower amygdala 
      response during emotion processing. LIMITATIONS: These findings require confirmation 
      in a longitudinal study to observe each individual's risk of developing depression; 
      without this, we cannot identify the true risk level of the first-degree relative or 
      low-risk control group. CONCLUSIONS: These findings have implications for 
      understanding the neural mechanisms of risk and resilience in depression: they are 
      consistent with the suggestion that preserved executive function might confer 
      resilience to developing depression in first-degree relatives of depressed patients.

AB  - Studies on cross-modal interaction have demonstrated attenuated as well as 
      facilitated effects for both neural responses as well as behavioral performance. The 
      goals of this pilot study were to investigate possible cross-modal interactions of 
      tactile stimulation on visual working memory and to identify possible neuronal 
      correlates by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During fMRI, 
      participants (n = 12 females, n = 12 males) performed a verbal n-back task (0-back 
      and 2-back tasks) while tactile pressure to the left thumbnail was delivered. 
      Participants presented significantly lower behavioral performances (increased error 
      rates, and reaction times) during the 2-back task as compared to the 0-back task. 
      Task performance was independent of pressure in both tasks. This means that working 
      memory performance was not impacted by a low salient tactile stimulus. Also in the 
      fMRI data, no significant interactions of n-back x pressure were observed. In 
      conclusion, the current study found no influence of tactile pressure on task-related 
      brain activity during n-back (0-back and 2-back) tasks.

AB  - Theoretical models and preceding studies have described age-related alterations in 
      neuronal activation of frontoparietal regions in a working memory (WM) 
      load-dependent manner. However, to date, underlying neuronal mechanisms of these WM 
      load-dependent activation changes in aging remain poorly understood. The aim of this 
      study was to investigate these mechanisms in terms of effective connectivity by 
      application of dynamic causal modeling with Bayesian Model Selection. Eighteen 
      healthy younger (age: 20-32 years) and 32 older (60-75 years) participants performed 
      an n-back task with 3 WM load levels during functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI). Behavioral and conventional fMRI results replicated age group by WM load 
      interactions. Importantly, the analysis of effective connectivity derived from 
      dynamic causal modeling, indicated an age- and performance-related reduction in WM 
      load-dependent modulation of connectivity from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to 
      inferior parietal lobule. This finding provides evidence for the proposal that 
      age-related WM decline manifests as deficient WM load-dependent modulation of 
      neuronal top-down control and can integrate implications from theoretical models and 
      previous studies of functional changes in the aging brain.

TI  - Neural alterations in working memory of mild-moderate TBI: An fMRI study in 
      Malaysia.
LID - 10.1002/jnr.25023 [doi]
AB  - Working memory (WM) encompasses crucial cognitive processes or abilities to retain 
      and manipulate temporary information for immediate execution of complex cognitive 
      tasks in daily functioning such as reasoning and decision-making. The WM of 
      individuals sustaining traumatic brain injury (TBI) was commonly compromised, 
      especially in the domain of WM. The current study investigated the brain responses 
      of WM in a group of participants with mild-moderate TBI compared to their healthy 
      counterparts employing functional magnetic resonance imaging. All consented 
      participants (healthy: n = 26 and TBI: n = 15) performed two variations of the 
      n-back WM task with four load conditions (0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-back). The respective 
      within-group effects showed a right hemisphere-dominance activation and slower 
      reaction in performance for the TBI group. Random-effects analysis revealed 
      activation difference between the two groups in the right occipital lobe in the 
      guided n-back with cues, and in the bilateral occipital lobe, superior parietal 
      region, and cingulate cortices in the n-back without cues. The left middle frontal 
      gyrus was implicated in the load-dependent processing of WM in both groups. Further 
      group analysis identified that the notable activation changes in the frontal gyri 
      and anterior cingulate cortex are according to low and high loads. Though relatively 
      smaller in scale, this study was eminent as it clarified the neural alterations in 
      WM in the mild-moderate TBI group compared to healthy controls. It confirmed the 
      robustness of the phenomenon in TBI with the reproducibility of the results in a 
      heterogeneous non-Western sample.

AB  - Improved clinical care for Bipolar Disorder (BD) relies on the identification of 
      diagnostic markers that can reliably detect disease-related signals in clinically 
      heterogeneous populations. At the very least, diagnostic markers should be able to 
      differentiate patients with BD from healthy individuals and from individuals at 
      familial risk for BD who either remain well or develop other psychopathology, most 
      commonly Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). These issues are particularly pertinent to 
      the development of translational applications of neuroimaging as they represent 
      challenges for which clinical observation alone is insufficient. We therefore 
      applied pattern classification to task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) data of the n-back working memory task, to test their predictive value in 
      differentiating patients with BD (n=30) from healthy individuals (n=30) and from 
      patients' relatives who were either diagnosed with MDD (n=30) or were free of any 
      personal lifetime history of psychopathology (n=30). Diagnostic stability in these 
      groups was confirmed with 4-year prospective follow-up. Task-based activation 
      patterns from the fMRI data were analyzed with Gaussian Process Classifiers (GPC), a 
      machine learning approach to detecting multivariate patterns in neuroimaging 
      datasets. Consistent significant classification results were only obtained using 
      data from the 3-back versus 0-back contrast. Using contrast, patients with BD were 
      correctly classified compared to unrelated healthy individuals with an accuracy of 
      83.5%, sensitivity of 84.6% and specificity of 92.3%. Classification accuracy, 
      sensitivity and specificity when comparing patients with BD to their relatives with 
      MDD, were respectively 73.1%, 53.9% and 94.5%. Classification accuracy, sensitivity 
      and specificity when comparing patients with BD to their healthy relatives were 
      respectively 81.8%, 72.7% and 90.9%. We show that significant individual 
      classification can be achieved using whole brain pattern analysis of task-based 
      working memory fMRI data. The high accuracy and specificity achieved by all three 
      classifiers suggest that multivariate pattern recognition analyses can aid 
      clinicians in the clinical care of BD in situations of true clinical uncertainty 
      regarding the diagnosis and prognosis.

TI  - Working memory dysfunction in schizophrenia patients with obsessive-compulsive 
      symptoms: an fMRI study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of schizophrenia patients also meets DSM-IV 
      criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Schizophrenia with OCD 
      ("schizo-obsessive") patients are characterized by distinct clinical 
      characteristics, treatment response and prognosis. Whether schizo-obsessive patients 
      exhibit a distinct pattern of brain activation is yet unknown. To address this 
      question, the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study explicitly 
      compared alterations in brain activation and functional connectivity (FC) underlying 
      a working memory deficit in schizophrenia patients with and without OCD. METHODS: 
      fMRI was applied during the N-back working memory (WM) task in three groups: 
      schizo-obsessive (n=16), schizophrenia (n=17) and matched healthy volunteers (n=20). 
      WM-related activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the 
      right caudate nucleus, brain areas relevant to schizophrenia and OCD, and FC 
      analysis were used for the evaluation. RESULTS: The two schizophrenia groups with 
      and without OCD exhibited a similar reduction in activation in the right DLPFC and 
      right caudate, as well as decreased FC compared to the healthy controls. Notably, 
      reduced regional brain activation was not related to severity of schizophrenic or 
      OCD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Schizo-obsessive patients do not differ from their 
      non-OCD schizophrenia counterparts in brain activation patterns during the N-back WM 
      task. Cognitive paradigms taping alternative neural networks (e.g., orbitofrontal 
      cortex) particularly relevant to OCD, are warranted in the search for potential 
      distinctive brain activation patterns of the schizo-obsessive subgroup.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare cognition and brain function in elderly Tai Chi and Water 
      Aerobics practitioners. METHODS: Eight Tai Chi (TC) and 8 Water Aerobics (WA) 
      practitioners matched by gender, education and age underwent neuropsychological and 
      fMRI scan during attention (Stroop Word Color Task) and working memory (N Back) 
      tasks. RESULTS: Groups were similar for demographic and cognitive variables. Besides 
      anxiety (smaller in TC group), there were no differences between groups in 
      neuropsychological variables. During the Stroop Word Color Task, TC group had 
      smaller brain activation in the right intracalcarine cortex, lateral occipital 
      cortex, and occipital pole, than WA. During N back, TC group presented smaller brain 
      activation in the right frontal pole and superior frontal gyrus. CONCLUSION: Despite 
      the small number of participants in this preliminary study, both groups had similar 
      cognitive performance, however the Tai Chi group required less brain activation to 
      perform the attention and memory tasks, therefore they may have a more efficient 
      cognitive performance than Water Aerobics group.

TI  - Effects of oxytocin on working memory and executive control system connectivity in 
      posttraumatic stress disorder.
PG  - 391-402
LID - 10.1037/pha0000197 [doi]
AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic, debilitating condition for which 
      effective medications are scant and little is known about neural correlates of risk 
      versus resilience. Oxytocin is a hypothalamic neuropeptide that has demonstrated 
      promise in modulating neurobiological and behavioral correlates of PTSD. Cognitive 
      deficits in areas such as working memory and executive control are highly prevalent 
      among individuals with PTSD and oxytocin might modulate these impairments in 
      individuals with PTSD. Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, this study 
      employed functional MRI (fMRI) and the n-back working memory task to examine the 
      effects of oxytocin (24 IU) versus placebo on working memory and dorsolateral 
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) connectivity among individuals with PTSD (n = 16) as 
      compared with a trauma-exposed control group (n = 18). Results indicate that 
      individuals with PTSD on oxytocin performed better in the 2-back condition of the 
      n-back task compared with individuals with PTSD on placebo. Results also indicate 
      that connectivity between DLPFC and anterior cingulate increased in the 2-back 
      condition among individuals with PTSD on oxytocin as compared with placebo. These 
      findings provide preliminary evidence of an effect of oxytocin on working memory 
      among individuals with PTSD and insights into the neurobiological mechanisms 
      underlying this association. Future studies are necessary to understand the 
      mechanisms responsible for working memory deficits in PTSD and to examine the 
      potential of oxytocin for use as a treatment for PTSD. (PsycINFO Database Record

      brain function in young and older adults.
LID - 22565 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Depression and anxiety and are associated with cognitive deficits and 
      brain changes, especially in older adults. Despite the frequent co-occurrence of 
      these conditions, cognitive neuroscience studies examining comorbid depression and 
      anxiety are limited. The goal of the present study was to examine the unique and 
      combined effect of depressive and anxiety symptoms on cognitive and brain 
      functioning in young and older adults. METHODS: Seventy-one healthy, 
      community-dwelling adults between the ages of 18 and 81 were administered a 
      neuropsychological battery and completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies 
      Depression Scale (CES-D) and the trait form of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory 
      (STAI-T). A subset of 25 participants also underwent functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) scanning while completing the n-back working memory task. RESULTS: 
      Total depressive symptoms, depressed mood symptoms, and somatic symptoms were 
      associated with deficits in speed, working memory and executive functions, 
      especially in older adults. Symptoms of lack of well-being were not associated with 
      any neuropsychological test. Anxiety was associated with better attention and 
      working memory. Moreover, anxiety modified the relationship between depressive 
      symptoms and executive functioning in older adults, as elevated depressive symptoms 
      were associated with worse performance at low levels of anxiety, but not at higher 
      anxiety levels. Similarly, analysis of fMRI data showed that total depressive 
      symptoms and depressed mood symptoms were associated with decreased activity in the 
      superior frontal gyrus at low anxiety levels, but not at high anxiety levels. 
      CONCLUSION: Results confirm previous reports that subthreshold depression and 
      anxiety impact cognitive and brain functioning and suggest that the interaction of 
      depression and anxiety results in distinct cognitive and brain changes. Findings 
      highlight the importance of assessing and controlling for symptoms of depression and 
      anxiety in research studies of either condition.

TI  - Maintenance vs. Manipulation in Auditory Verbal Working Memory in the Elderly: New 
      Insights Based on Temporal Dynamics of Information Processing in the Millisecond 
      Time Range.
PG  - 194
LID - 10.3389/fnagi.2020.00194 [doi]
LID - 194
AB  - Working memory (WM) is a limited-capacity cognitive system that allows the storage 
      and use of a limited amount of information for a short period of time. Two WM 
      processes can be distinguished: maintenance (i.e., storing, monitoring, and matching 
      information) and manipulation (i.e., reordering and updating information). A number 
      of studies have reported an age-related decline in WM, but the mechanisms underlying 
      this deterioration need to be investigated. Previous research, including studies 
      conducted in our laboratory, revealed that age-related cognitive deficits are 
      related to decreased millisecond timing, i.e., the ability to perceive and organize 
      incoming events in time. The aim of the current study was: (1) to identify in the 
      elderly the brain network involved in the maintenance and manipulation WM processes; 
      and (2) to use an fMRI task to investigate the relation between the brain activity 
      associated with these two processes and the efficiency of temporal information 
      processing (TIP) on a millisecond level reflected by psychophysical indices. 
      Subjects were 41 normal healthy elderly people aged from 62 to 78 years. They 
      performed: (1) an auditory verbal n-back task for assessing WM efficiency in an MRI 
      scanner; and (2) a psychophysical auditory temporal-order judgment (TOJ) task for 
      assessing temporal resolution in the millisecond domain outside the scanner. The 
      n-back task comprised three conditions (0-, 1-, and 2-back), which allowed 
      maintenance (1- vs. 0-back comparisons) and manipulation (2- vs. 1-back comparisons) 
      processes to be distinguished. Results revealed the involvement of a similar brain 
      network in the elderly to that found in previous studies. However, during 
      maintenance processes, we found relatively limited and focused activations, which 
      were significantly extended during manipulation. A novel result of our study, never 
      reported before, is an indication of significant moderate correlations between the 
      efficiency of WM and TIP. These correlations were found only for manipulation but 
      not for maintenance. Our results confirmed the hypothesis that manipulation in the 
      elderly is a dynamic process requiring skilled millisecond timing with high temporal 
      resolution. We conclude that millisecond timing contributes to WM manipulation in 
      the elderly, but not to maintenance.

AB  - Prevailing neuropsychological models of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
      (ADHD) propose that ADHD arises from deficits in executive functions such as working 
      memory, but accumulating clinical evidence suggests a dissociation between ADHD and 
      executive dysfunctions. This study examined whether ADHD and working memory capacity 
      are behaviorally and neurobiologically separable using functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI). Participants diagnosed with ADHD in childhood who subsequently 
      remitted or persisted in their diagnosis as adults were characterized at follow-up 
      in adulthood as either impaired or unimpaired in spatial working memory relative to 
      controls who never had ADHD. ADHD participants with impaired spatial working memory 
      performed worse than controls and ADHD participants with unimpaired working memory 
      during an n-back working memory task while being scanned. Both controls and ADHD 
      participants with unimpaired working memory exhibited significant linearly 
      increasing activation in the inferior frontal junction, precuneus, lingual gyrus, 
      and cerebellum as a function of working-memory load, and these activations did not 
      differ significantly between these groups. ADHD participants with impaired working 
      memory exhibited significant hypoactivation in the same regions, which was 
      significantly different than both control participants and ADHD participants with 
      unimpaired working memory. These findings support both a behavioral and 
      neurobiological dissociation between ADHD and working memory capacity.

AB  - The neurofunctional effects of Cognitive training (CT) are poorly understood. Our 
      main objective was to assess fMRI brain activation patterns in children with ADHD 
      who received CT as an add-on treatment to stimulant medication. We included twenty 
      children with ADHD from a clinical trial of stimulant medication and CT (10 in 
      medication + CT and 10 in medication + non-active training). Between-group 
      differences were assessed in performance and in brain activation during 3 fMRI 
      paradigms of working memory (N-back: 0-back, 1-back, 2-back, 3-back), sustained 
      attention (Sustained Attention Task - SAT: 2 s, 5 s and 8 s delays) and inhibitory 
      control (Go/No-Go). We found significant group x time x condition interactions in 
      working memory (WM) and sustained attention on brain activation. In N-back, 
      decreases were observed in the BOLD signal change from baseline to endpoint with 
      increasing WM load in the right insula, right putamen, left thalamus and left 
      pallidum in the CT compared to the non-active group; in SAT - increases in the BOLD 
      signal change from baseline to endpoint with increasing delays were observed in 
      bilateral precuneus, right insula, bilateral associative visual cortex and angular 
      gyrus, right middle temporal, precentral, postcentral, superior frontal and middle 
      frontal gyri in the CT compared to the non-active group. CT in ADHD was associated 
      with changes in activation in task-relevant parietal and striato-limbic regions of 
      sustained attention and working memory. Changes in brain activity may precede 
      behavioral performance modifications in working memory and sustained attention, but 
      not in inhibitory control.

TI  - Peripheral inflammation related to lower fMRI activation during a working memory 
      task and resting functional connectivity among older adults: a preliminary study.
PG  - 341-349
LID - 10.1002/gps.4482 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Peripheral inflammation has been associated with adverse effects on 
      cognition and brain structure in late life, a process called 'inflammaging.' 
      Identifying biomarkers of preclinical cognitive decline is critical in the 
      development of preventative therapies, and peripheral inflammation may be able to 
      serve as an indicator of cognitive decline. However, little is known regarding the 
      relationship between peripheral inflammation and brain structure and function among 
      older adults. METHODS: Twenty-four older adults (mean age = 78) underwent a 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) resting state functional connectivity 
      scan, and a subset (n = 14) completed the n-Back working memory task in the scanner. 
      All participants completed a blood draw, and inflammation was measured with 
      interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP). RESULTS: Surprisingly, age was 
      unrelated to measures of inflammation (IL-6, CRP) or brain function (default mode 
      network (DMN) connectivity; working memory performance; blood oxygenation level 
      dependent (BOLD) activation with higher working memory load). However, lower 
      functional connectivity between the left parietal seed and all other DMN regions was 
      associated with higher levels of IL-6 and CRP. Additionally, greater plasma 
      concentration of IL-6 was associated with lower BOLD activation in the left middle 
      frontal gyrus in response to increased working memory load. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      preliminary findings support the importance of IL-6 and CRP in brain function among 
      older adults. Frontal and parietal regions may be particularly sensitive to the 
      effects of inflammation. Additionally, these findings provide preliminary evidence 
      of inflammatory contributions to level of neural activity, even after accounting for 
      vascular risk factors.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) often results in cognitive impairments for patients. 
      The aim of this proof of concept study was to establish the nature of abnormalities, 
      in terms of activity and connectivity, in the working memory network of TBI patients 
      and how these relate to compromised behavioral outcomes. Further, this study 
      examined the neural correlates of working memory improvement following the 
      administration of methylphenidate. We report behavioral, functional and structural 
      MRI data from a group of 15 Healthy Controls (HC) and a group of 15 TBI patients, 
      acquired during the execution of the N-back task. The patients were studied on two 
      occasions after the administration of either placebo or 30 mg of methylphenidate. 
      Between group tests revealed a significant difference in performance when HCs were 
      compared to TBI patients on placebo [F((1, 28)) = 4.426, p < 0.05, η (p)(2) = 
      0.136]. This difference disappeared when the patients took methylphenidate [F((1, 
      28)) = 3.665, p = 0.66]. Patients in the middle range of baseline performance 
      demonstrated the most benefit from methylphenidate. Changes in the TBI patient 
      activation levels in the Left Cerebellum significantly and positively correlated 
      with changes in performance (r = 0.509, df = 13, p = 0.05). Whole-brain connectivity 
      analysis using the Left Cerebellum as a seed revealed widespread negative 
      interactions between the Left Cerebellum and parietal and frontal cortices as well 
      as subcortical areas. Neither the TBI group on methylphenidate nor the HC group 
      demonstrated any significant negative interactions. Our findings indicate that (a) 
      TBI significantly reduces the levels of activation and connectivity strength between 
      key areas of the working memory network and (b) Methylphenidate improves the 
      cognitive outcomes on a working memory task. Therefore, we conclude that 
      methylphenidate may render the working memory network in a TBI group more consistent 
      with that of an intact working memory network.

TI  - Transfer after Dual n-Back Training Depends on Striatal Activation Change.
PG  - 10198-213
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2305-15.2016 [doi]
AB  - The dual n-back working memory (WM) training paradigm (comprising auditory and 
      visual stimuli) has gained much attention since studies have shown widespread 
      transfer effects. By including a multimodal dual-task component, the task is 
      demanding to the human cognitive system. We investigated whether dual n-back 
      training improves general cognitive resources or a task-specific WM updating process 
      in participants. We expected: (1) widespread transfer effects and the recruitment of 
      a common neuronal network by the training and the transfer tasks and (2) narrower 
      transfer results and that a common activation network alone would not produce 
      transfer, but instead an activation focus on the striatum, which is associated with 
      WM updating processes. The training group showed transfer to an untrained 
      dual-modality WM updating task, but not to single-task versions of the training or 
      the transfer task. They also showed diminished neuronal overlap between the training 
      and the transfer task from pretest to posttest and an increase in striatal 
      activation in both tasks. Furthermore, we found an association between the striatal 
      activation increase and behavioral improvement. The control groups showed no 
      transfer and no change in the amount of activation overlap or in striatal activation 
      from pretest to posttest. We conclude that, instead of improving general cognitive 
      resources (which would have required a transfer effect to all transfer tasks and 
      that a frontal activation overlap between the tasks produced transfer), dual n-back 
      training improved a task-specific process: WM updating of stimuli from two 
      modalities. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The current study allows for a better 
      understanding of the cognitive and neural effects of working memory (WM) training 
      and transfer. It shows that dual n-back training mainly improves specific processes 
      of WM updating, and this improvement leads to narrow transfer effects to tasks 
      involving the same processes. On a neuronal level this is accompanied by increased 
      neural activation in the striatum that is related to WM updating. The current 
      findings challenge the view that dual n-back training provokes a general boosting of 
      the WM system and of its neural underpinnings located in frontoparietal brain 
      regions. Instead, the findings imply the relevance of task-specific brain regions 
      which are involved in important cognitive processes during training and transfer 
      tasks.

TI  - Quantifying neural efficiency and neural capacity across the brain during a working 
      memory task using a quadratic model of neural-cognitive relationships.

AB  - Task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) neuroimaging for the study of 
      cognitive neuroscience provides insight into how the brain responds to increasing 
      cognitive demands. Theoretical models of neural-cognitive relationships define 
      neural efficiency and neural capacity as two parameters to describe the rate of gain 
      of brain activity and the upper limits of the increases, respectively. Although 
      qualitatively well described, there are limited discussions and demonstrations of 
      estimating these parameters from data. The current work presents a method using a 
      quadratic equation model of cognitive demands. The methods were applied to 21 
      healthy young adults while engaging in four levels of the verbal n-back working 
      memory task (0, 1, 2 and 3-back). Measures of the area under the curve captured both 
      linear and curvilinear responses to quantify the locations and amounts of 
      task-related increases in brain activity. In addition, we calculated voxel-wise maps 
      of neural efficiency and neural capacity. Results showed increases in brain 
      activation in regions typically involved in working memory. The relationships 
      between increasing cognitive demands and brain activity also differed across the 
      brain within and between individuals, as indicated by differential neural efficiency 
      and neural capacity values. This approach provides tools for evaluating current 
      theories about the relationships between brain activity and cognition. Neural 
      efficiency and neural capacity provide physiological measures of brain activity, 
      which will help evaluate how age, disease and intervention processes affect brain 
      activity. Finally, all presented methods are readily applicable using standard 
      current software packages for neuroimaging.

AB  - The investigation of the brain connectome with functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) and graph theory analyses has recently gained much popularity, but little is 
      known about the robustness of these properties, in particular those derived from 
      active fMRI tasks. Here, we studied the test-retest reliability of brain graphs 
      calculated from 26 healthy participants with three established fMRI experiments 
      (n-back working memory, emotional face-matching, resting state) and two parcellation 
      schemes for node definition (AAL atlas, functional atlas proposed by Power et al.). 
      We compared the intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) of five different data 
      processing strategies and demonstrated a superior reliability of task-regression 
      methods with condition-specific regressors. The between-task comparison revealed 
      significantly higher ICCs for resting state relative to the active tasks, and a 
      superiority of the n-back task relative to the face-matching task for global and 
      local network properties. While the mean ICCs were typically lower for the active 
      tasks, overall fair to good reliabilities were detected for global and local 
      connectivity properties, and for the n-back task with both atlases, smallworldness. 
      For all three tasks and atlases, low mean ICCs were seen for the local network 
      properties. However, node-specific good reliabilities were detected for node degree 
      in regions known to be critical for the challenged functions (resting-state: 
      default-mode network nodes, n-back: fronto-parietal nodes, face-matching: limbic 
      nodes). Between-atlas comparison demonstrated significantly higher reliabilities for 
      the functional parcellations for global and local network properties. Our findings 
      can inform the choice of processing strategies, brain atlases and outcome properties 
      for fMRI studies using active tasks, graph theory methods, and within-subject 
      designs, in particular future pharmaco-fMRI studies.

AB  - The large number of behavioral studies testing whether working memory training 
      improves performance on an untrained task have yielded inconclusive results. 
      Moreover, some studies have investigated the possible neural changes during the 
      performance of untrained tasks after training. Here, we studied the transfer from 
      n-back training to the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), two different 
      tasks that use the central executive system to maintain verbal stimuli. Participants 
      completed fMRI sessions at baseline, immediately after one week of training, and at 
      the five-week follow-up. Although behavioral transfer effects were not obtained, 
      training was associated with decreased activation in the anterior dorsolateral 
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; BA 9/46) while performing the PASAT that remained stable 
      five weeks later. Consistent with our hypothesis, the changes in the anterior DLFPC 
      largely overlapped with the n-back task fMRI activations. In conclusion, working 
      memory training improves efficiency in brain areas involved in the trained task that 
      may affect untrained tasks, specifically in brain areas responsible for the same 
      cognitive processes.

AB  - The functional network of the brain continually adapts to changing environmental 
      demands. The consequence of behavioral automation for task-related functional 
      network architecture remains far from understood. We investigated the neural 
      reflections of behavioral automation as participants mastered a dual n-back task. In 
      four fMRI scans equally spanning a 6-week training period, we assessed brain network 
      modularity, a substrate for adaptation in biological systems. We found that 
      whole-brain modularity steadily increased during training for both conditions of the 
      dual n-back task. In a dynamic analysis,we found that the autonomy of the default 
      mode system and integration among task-positive systems were modulated by training. 
      The automation of the n-back task through training resulted in non-linear changes in 
      integration between the fronto-parietal and default mode systems, and integration 
      with the subcortical system. Our findings suggest that the automation of a 
      cognitively demanding task may result in more segregated network organization.

AB  - Previous research in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has indicated 
      performance decrements in working memory (WM) and response inhibition. However, 
      underlying neural mechanisms of WM deficits are not well understood to date, and 
      empirical evidence for a proposed conceptual link to inhibition deficits is missing. 
      We investigated WM performance in a numeric n-back task with four WM load conditions 
      during functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in 51 patients with OCD and 49 
      healthy control participants who were matched for age, sex, and education. 
      Additionally, a stop signal task was performed outside the MRI scanner in a 
      subsample. On the behavioral level, a significant WM load by group interaction was 
      found for both accuracy (p < 0.02) and reaction time measures (p < 0.03), indicating 
      increased reaction times as well as reduced accuracy specifically at high WM load 
      (3-back) in patients with OCD. Whole-brain analyses of fMRI-data identified neural 
      correlates of a load-dependent WM decrement in OCD in the supplementary motor area 
      (SMA) and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Within the OCD sample, SMA-activity as 
      well as n-back performance were correlated with stop signal task performance. 
      Results from behavioral and fMRI-analyses indicate a reduced WM load-dependent 
      modulation of neural activity in OCD and suggest a common neural mechanism for 
      inhibitory dysfunction and WM decrements in OCD.

AB  - Previous neuropsychological studies indicate that OCD subtypes such as checking 
      rituals might be associated with a working memory deficit. On the other hand, 
      functional neuroimaging studies found functional abnormalities of the frontal cortex 
      and subcortical structures in OCD. Combined with functional imaging method, we 
      applied neuropsychological batteries to demonstrate a working memory deficit in OCD 
      by comparison with normal controls. In addition, working memory and brain activation 
      were further examined with symptom-based analysis. Forty patients with OCD and 25 
      normal controls were examined using neuropsychological tests including the WAIS-R, 
      WCST, WMS-R, and R-OCFT and functional MRI (fMRI) during the N-back task including 
      0- and 2-back task. On fMRI, the brain regions activated during the performance and 
      the differences in the activation between patients and controls were identified. 
      Additional analyses of severity and subtypes were conducted by using Y-BOCS severity 
      score, symptom-checklist and Leckman's four-factor model, respectively. On the 
      neuropsychological tests, the OCD patients had significantly lower scores on the 
      delayed recall section of the WMS-R and the immediate recall section of the R-OCFT 
      compared to the controls. On fMRI, the patients showed greater activation in the 
      right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), left superior temporal gyrus (STG), 
      left insula, and cuneus during two-back task compared to the controls. Right 
      orbitofrontal cortex activity showed a significant positive correlation with Y-BOCS 
      scores in OCD. Furthermore, patients with obsessions/checking rituals (n=10) showed 
      severer memory deficits and decreased activity in the postcentral gyrus than 
      patients with cleanliness/washing rituals (n=14). In conclusion, we found 
      neuropsychological dysfunction and brain abnormalities in OCD. Furthermore, our 
      results suggested that symptom severity and symptom subtype such as 
      obsessions/checking might affect neuropsychological dysfunction and related brain 
      activities.

AB  - Millions of women worldwide use oral contraceptives (i.e., birth control pill; OCs), 
      often starting during puberty/adolescence; however, it is unknown how OC use during 
      this critical period of development affects the brain, especially with regard to 
      emotional working memory. Here, we examined stress reactivity, and brain structure 
      and function in OC users using the Trier Social Stress Test and structural and 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Our results show that OC use during 
      puberty/adolescence gives rise to a blunted stress response and alters brain 
      activation during working memory processing. OC use, in general, is also linked to 
      increased prefrontal brain activation during working memory processing for 
      negatively arousing stimuli. OC use is also related to significant structural 
      changes in brain regions implicated in memory and emotional processing. Together, 
      these findings highlight that OC use induces changes to brain structure and function 
      and alters stress reactivity. These findings may provide a mechanistic insight for 
      the increased vulnerability to mood-related mental illness in women after OC use.

TI  - Lack of association between COMT and working memory in a population-based cohort of 
      healthy young adults.

LID - 10.1038/npp.2013.24 [doi]
AB  - The Val158Met polymorphism of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene is an 
      important regulator of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, an area critical to 
      working memory. Working memory deficits are present in several psychiatric 
      disorders, and there is wide variation in working memory capacity in the normal 
      population. Association studies of COMT and working memory in healthy volunteers 
      have yielded inconsistent results, possibly because of small sample sizes. Here we 
      examine COMT in relation to N-Back working memory task performance in a large 
      population-based cohort of young adults. We predicted individuals with one or two 
      copies of the Met allele would perform better, and that this relationship would be 
      more evident in males than females. Participants (N=1857-2659) tested at 18 years of 
      age, were enrolled in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). 
      We used multiple regression to examine effects of sex and COMT genotype on N-Back 
      hits, false positives, discriminability (d'), and reaction time while controlling 
      for important covariates. COMT genotype did not predict hits or d'. There was a 
      nominally significant interaction between COMT and sex on false positives, but this 
      was not in the predicted direction, and was not significant after controlling for 
      covariates. COMT genotype was not related to working memory in this large 
      population-based cohort. It is possible COMT is not meaningfully associated with 
      working memory in healthy young adults, or that COMT effects are detectable only in 
      assessments reflecting neural processes underlying cognition, such as fMRI, rather 
      than in behavioral performance.

AB  - Individuals who were born very preterm (VPT; <33 gestational weeks) are at risk of 
      experiencing deficits in tasks involving executive function in childhood and beyond. 
      In addition, the type and severity of neonatal brain injury associated with very 
      preterm birth may exert differential effects on executive functioning by altering 
      its neuroanatomical substrates. Here we addressed this question by investigating 
      with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) the haemodynamic response during 
      executive-type processing using a phonological verbal fluency and a working memory 
      task in VPT-born young adults who had experienced differing degrees of neonatal 
      brain injury. 12 VPT individuals with a history of periventricular haemorrhage and 
      ventricular dilatation (PVH+VD), 17 VPT individuals with a history of uncomplicated 
      periventricular haemorrhage (UPVH), 13 VPT individuals with no history of neonatal 
      brain injury and 17 controls received an MRI scan whilst completing a verbal fluency 
      task with two cognitive loads ('easy' and 'hard' letters). Two groups of VPT 
      individuals (PVH+VD; n = 10, UPVH; n = 8) performed an n-back task with three 
      cognitive loads (1-, 2-, 3-back). Results demonstrated that VPT individuals 
      displayed hyperactivation in frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices and in caudate 
      nucleus, insula and thalamus compared to controls, as demands of the verbal fluency 
      task increased, regardless of type of neonatal brain injury. On the other hand, 
      during the n-back task and as working memory load increased, the PVH+VD group showed 
      less engagement of the frontal cortex than the UPVH group. In conclusion, this study 
      suggests that the functional neuroanatomy of different executive-type processes is 
      altered following VPT birth and that neural activation associated with specific 
      aspects of executive function (i.e., working memory) may be particularly sensitive 
      to the extent of neonatal brain injury.

AB  - While cognitive changes and mood instability are frequent symptoms reported by 
      menopausal women, the degree to which the decline in estrogen production is 
      responsible is not yet clear. Several lines of evidence suggest that estrogen may 
      produce its effects on cognition and mood through modulation of serotonergic 
      function. To test this hypothesis, we used the tryptophan depletion (TD) paradigm to 
      lower central serotonin levels and pharmacologically manipulated estrogen levels in 
      healthy menopausal women. We examined the individual and combined effects of 
      estradiol and serotonin on working memory, emotion processing and task-related brain 
      activation. Eight healthy predominantly early postmenopausal women underwent TD or 
      sham depletion followed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) both before 
      and after short-term transdermal estradiol 75-150 μg/d administration. There was an 
      estradiol treatment by TD interaction for brain activation during performance on 
      both the N-back Task (working memory) and Emotion Identification Task (affective 
      processing). During the 2-back condition, TD attenuated activation prior to, but not 
      after, estradiol treatment in the right and left dorsal lateral prefrontal and 
      middle frontal/cingulate gyrus. During emotion identification, TD heightened 
      activation in the orbital frontal cortex and bilateral amygdala, and this effect was 
      attenuated by estradiol treatment. These results provide preliminary evidence that 
      serotonergic effects directly mediate the impact of estrogen on brain activation 
      during working memory and affective processing.

AB  - The present randomized double-blinded cross-over study aims to extensively study the 
      neural correlates underpinning cognitive functions in healthy subjects after acute 
      glucose and fructose administration, using an integrative multimodal neuroimaging 
      approach. Five minutes after glucose, fructose, or placebo administration through a 
      nasogastric tube, 12 participants underwent 3 complementary neuroimaging techniques: 
      2 task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sequences to assess 
      working memory (N-back) and response inhibition (Go/No-Go) and one resting state 
      fMRI sequence to address the cognition-related fronto-parietal network (FPN) and 
      salience network (SN). During working memory processing, glucose intake decreased 
      activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) relative to placebo, while 
      fructose decreased activation in the ACC and sensory cortex relative to placebo and 
      glucose. During response inhibition, glucose and fructose decreased activation in 
      the ACC, insula and visual cortex relative to placebo. Resting state fMRI indicated 
      increased global connectivity strength of the FPN and the SN during glucose and 
      fructose intake. The results demonstrate that glucose and fructose lead to partially 
      different partially overlapping changes in regional brain activities that underpin 
      cognitive performance in different tasks.

TI  - Longitudinal Increases in Cerebral Brain Activation During Working Memory 
      Performance in Friedreich Ataxia: 24-Month Data from IMAGE-FRDA.
PG  - 182-191
LID - 10.1007/s12311-019-01094-6 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) has been associated with functional abnormalities in 
      cerebral and cerebellar networks, particularly in the ventral attention network. 
      However, how functional alterations change with disease progression remains largely 
      unknown. Longitudinal changes in brain activation, associated with working memory 
      performance (N-back task), and grey matter volume were assessed over 24 months in 21 
      individuals with FRDA and 28 healthy controls using functional and structural 
      magnetic resonance imaging, respectively. Participants also completed a 
      neurocognitive battery assessing working memory (digit span), executive function 
      (Stroop, Haylings), and set-shifting (Trail Making Test). Individuals with FRDA 
      displayed significantly increased brain activation over 24 months in ventral 
      attention brain regions, including bilateral insula and inferior frontal gyrus (pars 
      triangularis and pars opercularis), compared with controls, but there was no 
      difference in working memory (N-back) performance between groups. Moreover, there 
      were no significant differences in grey matter volume changes between groups. 
      Significant correlations between brain activations and both clinical severity and 
      age at disease onset were observed in FRDA individuals only at 24 months. There was 
      significant longitudinal decline in Trail Making Test (TMT) difference score (B-A) 
      in individuals with FRDA, compared with controls. These findings provide the first 
      evidence of increased longitudinal activation over time in the cerebral cortex in 
      FRDA, compared with controls, despite comparable working memory performance. This 
      finding represents a possible compensatory response in the ventral attention network 
      to help sustain working memory performance in individuals with FRDA.

TI  - Cerebellar fMRI Activation Increases with Increasing Working Memory Demands.
PG  - 322-35
LID - 10.1007/s12311-015-0703-7 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the present study was to explore cerebellar contributions to the central 
      executive in n-back working memory tasks using 7-T functional magnetic imaging 
      (fMRI). We hypothesized that cerebellar activation increased with increasing working 
      memory demands. Activations of the cerebellar cortex and dentate nuclei were 
      compared between 0-back (serving as a motor control task), 1-back, and 2-back 
      working memory tasks for both verbal and abstract modalities. A block design was 
      used. Data of 27 participants (mean age 26.6 ± 3.8 years, female/male 12:15) were 
      included in group statistical analysis. We observed that cerebellar cortical 
      activations increased with higher central executive demands in n-back tasks 
      independent of task modality. As confirmed by subtraction analyses, additional 
      bilateral activations following higher executive demands were found primarily in 
      four distinct cerebellar areas: (i) the border region of lobule VI and crus I, (ii) 
      inferior parts of the lateral cerebellum (lobules crus II, VIIb, VIII, IX), (iii) 
      posterior parts of the paravermal cerebellar cortex (lobules VI, crus I, crus II), 
      and (iv) the inferior vermis (lobules VI, VIIb, VIII, IX). Dentate activations were 
      observed for both verbal and abstract modalities. Task-related increases were less 
      robust and detected for the verbal n-back tasks only. These results provide further 
      evidence that the cerebellum participates in an amodal bilateral neuronal network 
      representing the central executive during working memory n-back tasks.

TI  - The less BOLD, the wiser: support for the latent resource hypothesis after traumatic 
      brain injury.

AB  - Previous studies of the BOLD response in the injured brain have revealed neural 
      recruitment relative to controls during working memory tasks in several brain 
      regions, most consistently the right prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate 
      cortices. We previously proposed that the recruitment observed in this literature 
      represents auxiliary support resources, and that recruitment of PFC is not abnormal 
      or injury specific and should reduce as novelty and challenge decrease. The current 
      study directly tests this hypothesis in the context of practice of a working memory 
      task. It was hypothesized that individuals with brain injury would demonstrate 
      recruitment of previously indicated regions, behavioral improvement following task 
      practice, and a reduction in the BOLD signal in recruited regions after practice. 
      Individuals with traumatic brain injury and healthy controls performed the n-back 
      during fMRI acquisition, practiced each task out of the scanner, and returned to the 
      scanner for additional fMRI n-back acquisition. Statistical parametric maps 
      demonstrated a number of regions of recruitment in the 1-back in individuals with 
      brain injury and a number of corresponding regions of reduced activation in 
      individuals with brain injury following practice in both the 1-back and 2-back. 
      Regions of interest demonstrated reduced activation following practice, including 
      the anterior cingulate and right prefrontal cortices. Individuals with brain injury 
      demonstrated modest behavioral improvements following practice. These findings 
      suggest that neural recruitment in brain injury does not represent reorganization 
      but a natural extension of latent mechanisms that engage transiently and are 
      contingent upon cerebral challenge.

AB  - Neural plasticity is crucial for understanding the experience-dependent 
      reorganization of brain regulatory circuits and the pathophysiology of 
      schizophrenia. An important circuit-level feature derived from functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) is prefrontal-hippocampal seeded connectivity during 
      working memory, the best established intermediate connectivity phenotype of 
      schizophrenia risk to date. The phenotype is a promising marker for the effects of 
      plasticity-enhancing interventions, such as high-frequency repetitive transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and can be studied in healthy volunteers in the absence 
      of illness-related confounds, but the relationship to brain plasticity is 
      unexplored. We recruited 39 healthy volunteers to investigate the effects of 5 Hz 
      rTMS on prefrontal-hippocampal coupling during working memory and rest. In a 
      randomized and sham-controlled experiment, neuronavigation-guided rTMS was applied 
      to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and fMRI and functional 
      connectivity analyses [seeded connectivity and psychophysiological interaction 
      (PPI)] were used as readouts. Moreover, the test-retest reliability of 
      working-memory related connectivity markers was evaluated. rTMS provoked a 
      significant decrease in seeded functional connectivity of the right DLPFC and left 
      hippocampus during working memory that proved to be relatively time-invariant and 
      robust. PPI analyses provided evidence for a nominal effect of rTMS and poor 
      test-retest reliability. No effects on n-back-related activation and 
      DLPFC-hippocampus resting-state connectivity were observed. These data provide the 
      first in vivo evidence for the effects of plasticity induction on human 
      prefrontal-hippocampal network dynamics, offer insights into the biological 
      mechanisms of a well established intermediate phenotype linked to schizophrenia, and 
      underscores the importance of the choice of outcome measures in test-retest designs.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a disorder with a high heritability. Patients as well as their 
      first degree relatives display lower levels of performance in a number of cognitive 
      domains compared to subjects without genetic risk. Several studies could link these 
      aberrations to single genetic variants, however, only recently, polygenic risk 
      scores as proxies for genetic risk have been associated with cognitive domains and 
      their neural correlates. In the present study, a sample of healthy subjects (n=137) 
      performed a letter version of the n-back task while scanned with 3-T fMRI. All 
      subjects were genotyped with the PsychChip and polygenic risk scores were calculated 
      based on the PGC2 schizophrenia GWAS results. Polygenic risk for schizophrenia was 
      associated with a lower degree of brain activation in prefrontal areas during the 
      3-back compared to the 0-back baseline condition. Furthermore, polygenic risk was 
      associated with lower levels of brain activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus 
      during the 3-back compared to a 2-back condition. Polygenic risk leads to a shift in 
      the underlying activation pattern to the left side, thus resembling results reported 
      in patients with schizophrenia. The data may point to polygenic risk for 
      schizophrenia being associated with brain function in a cognitive task known to be 
      impaired in patients and their relatives.

AB  - Neural correlates of working memory (WM) training remain a matter of debate, 
      especially in older adults. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
      together with an n-back task to measure brain plasticity in healthy middle-aged 
      adults following an 8-week adaptive online verbal WM training. Participants 
      performed 32 sessions of this training on their personal computers. In addition, we 
      assessed direct effects of the training by applying a verbal WM task before and 
      after the training. Participants (mean age 55.85 ± 4.24 years) were pseudo-randomly 
      assigned to the experimental group (n = 30) or an active control group (n = 27). 
      Training resulted in an activity decrease in regions known to be involved in verbal 
      WM (i.e., fronto-parieto-cerebellar circuitry and subcortical regions), indicating 
      that the brain became potentially more efficient after the training. These 
      activation decreases were associated with a significant performance improvement in 
      the n-back task inside the scanner reflecting considerable practice effects. In 
      addition, there were training-associated direct effects in the additional, external 
      verbal WM task (i.e., HAWIE-R digit span forward task), and indicating that the 
      training generally improved performance in this cognitive domain. These results led 
      us to conclude that even at advanced age cognitive training can improve WM capacity 
      and increase neural efficiency in specific regions or networks.

TI  - Abnormal brain activity patterns during spatial working memory task in patients with 
      end-stage renal disease on maintenance hemodialysis: a fMRI study.
PG  - 1898-1911

AB  - Hemodialysis (HD) is associated with cognitive impairment in patients with end-stage 
      renal disease (ESRD). However, the neural mechanism of spatial working memory (SWM) 
      impairment in HD-ESRD patients remains unclear. We investigated the abnormal 
      alterations in SWM-associated brain activity patterns in HD-ESRD patients using 
      blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) 
      technique during n-back tasks. Twenty-two HD-ESRD patients and 22 well-matched 
      controls underwent an fMRI scan while undergoing a three-load n-back tasks with 
      different difficulty levels. Cognitive and mental states were assessed using a 
      battery of neuropsychologic tests. The HD-ESRD patients exhibited worse memory 
      abilities than controls. Compared with the control group, the HD-ESRD patient group 
      showed lower accuracy and longer response time under the n-back tasks, especially in 
      the 2-back task. The patterns of brain activation changed under different working 
      memory loads in the HD-ESRD patients, showing decreased activity in the right medial 
      frontal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus under 0-back and 1-back task, while more 
      decreased activation in the bilateral frontal cortex, parietal lobule, 
      anterior/posterior cingulate cortex and insula cortex under 2-back task. With the 
      increase of task difficulty, the activation degree of the frontal and parietal 
      cortex decreased. More importantly, we found that lower activation in frontal cortex 
      and parietal lobule was associated with worse cognitive function in the HD-ESRD 
      patients. These results demonstrate that the abnormal brain activity patterns of 
      frontal cortex and parietal lobule may reflect the neural mediation of SWM 
      impairment.

AB  - Non-heme iron accumulation contributes to age-related decline in brain structure and 
      cognition via a cascade of oxidative stress and inflammation, although its effect on 
      brain function is largely unexplored. Thus, we examine the impact of striatal iron 
      on dynamic range of BOLD modulation to working memory load. N ​= ​166 healthy adults 
      (age 20-94) underwent cognitive testing and an imaging session including n-back (0-, 
      2-, 3-, and 4-back fMRI), R2*-weighted imaging, and pcASL to measure cerebral blood 
      flow. A statistical model was constructed to predict voxelwise BOLD modulation by 
      age, striatal iron content and an age ​× ​iron interaction, controlling for cerebral 
      blood flow, sex, and task response time. A significant interaction between age and 
      striatal iron content on BOLD modulation was found selectively in the putamen, 
      caudate, and inferior frontal gyrus. Greater iron was associated with reduced 
      modulation to difficulty, particularly in middle-aged and younger adults with 
      greater iron content. Further, iron-related decreases in modulation were associated 
      with poorer executive function in an age-dependent manner. These results suggest 
      that iron may contribute to differences in functional brain activation prior to 
      older adulthood, highlighting the potential role of iron as an early factor 
      contributing to trajectories of functional brain aging.

TI  - Effects of chewing in working memory processing.
PG  - 189-92
LID - 10.1016/j.neulet.2008.03.033 [doi]
AB  - It has been generally suggested that chewing produces an enhancing effect on 
      cognitive performance-related aspects of memory by the test battery. Furthermore, 
      recent studies have shown that chewing is associated with activation of various 
      brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex. However, little is known about the 
      relation between cognitive performances affected by chewing and the neuronal 
      activity in specified regions in the brain. We therefore examined the effects of 
      chewing on neuronal activities in the brain during a working memory task using fMRI. 
      The subjects chewed gum, without odor and taste components, between continuously 
      performed two- or three-back (n-back) working memory tasks. Chewing increased the 
      BOLD signals in the middle frontal gyrus (Brodmann's areas 9 and 46) in the 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during the n-back tasks. Furthermore, there were more 
      prominent activations in the right premotor cortex, precuneus, thalamus, hippocampus 
      and inferior parietal lobe during the n-back tasks after the chewing trial. These 
      results suggest that chewing may accelerate or recover the process of working memory 
      besides inducing improvement in the arousal level by the chewing motion.

TI  - Brain activation and deactivation during location and color working memory tasks in 
      11-13-year-old children.
PG  - 56-64
LID - 10.1016/j.bandc.2008.05.010 [doi]
AB  - Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and n-back tasks we investigated 
      whether, in 11-13-year-old children, spatial (location) and nonspatial (color) 
      information is differentially processed during visual attention (0-back) and working 
      memory (WM) (2-back) tasks and whether such cognitive task performance, compared to 
      a resting state, results in regional deactivation. The location 0-back task, 
      compared to the color 0-back task, activated segregated areas in the frontal, 
      parietal and occipital cortices whereas no differentially activated voxels were 
      obtained when location and color 2-back tasks were directly contrasted. Several 
      midline cortical areas were less active during 0- and 2-back task performance than 
      resting state. The task-induced deactivation increased with task difficulty as 
      demonstrated by larger deactivation during 2-back than 0-back tasks. The results 
      suggest that, in 11-13-year-old children, the visual attentional network is 
      differently recruited by spatial and nonspatial information processing, but the 
      functional organization of cortical activation in WM in this age group is not based 
      on the type of information processed. Furthermore, 11-13-year-old children exhibited 
      a similar pattern of cortical deactivation that has been reported in adults during 
      cognitive task performance compared to a resting state.

TI  - Spatial working memory impairment in primary onset middle-age type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus: An ethology and BOLD-fMRI study.
PG  - 75-87
LID - 10.1002/jmri.24967 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To explore mild cognitive dysfunction and/or spatial working memory 
      impairment in patients with primary onset middle-age type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM] 
      using ethology (behavior tests) and blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen primary onset T2DM 
      patients and 18 matched subjects with normal blood glucose levels were all tested 
      using the Montreal cognitive assessment scale test, the Wechsler Memory Scale 
      Chinese-revised test, and scanned using BOLD-fMRI (1.5T, EPI sequence) while 
      performing the n-back task to find the activation intensity of some 
      cognition-related areas. RESULTS: The ethology results showed that T2DM patients had 
      a mild cognitive impairment and memory dysfunction (P < 0.05). The fMRI scan 
      identified a neural network consisting of bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
      (DLPFC), bilateral premotor area (PreMA), bilateral parietal lobe (PA), and anterior 
      cingulate cortex (ACC) / supplementary motor area (SMA) that was activated during 
      the n-back task, with right hemisphere dominance. However, only the right PA and 
      ACC/SMA showed a load effect via quantitative analysis in the T2DM group; the 
      activation intensity of most working memory-related brain areas for the T2DM group 
      were lower than for the control group under three memory loads. Furthermore, we 
      found that the activation intensity of some cognition-related areas, including the 
      right insular lobe, left caudate nucleus, and bilateral hippocampus/parahippocampal 
      gyrus were lower than the control group under the memory loads. CONCLUSION: 
      Diabetes-related brain damage of primary onset middle-age T2DM patients with right 
      DLPFC-posterior parietal lobe and parahippocampal gyrus default network causes 
      impairment of spatial working memory and mild cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - Using graph theory measures common to complex network analyses of neuroimaging data, 
      the objective of this study was to explore the effects of increasing working memory 
      processing load on functional brain network topology in a cohort of young adults. 
      Measures of modularity in complex brain networks quantify how well a network is 
      organized into densely interconnected communities. We investigated changes in both 
      the large-scale modular organization of the functional brain network as a whole and 
      regional changes in modular organization as demands on working memory increased from 
      n = 1 to n = 2 on the standard n-back task. We further investigated the relationship 
      between modular properties across working memory load conditions and behavioral 
      performance. Our results showed that regional modular organization within the 
      default mode and working memory circuits significantly changed from 1-back to 2-back 
      task conditions. However, the regional modular organization was not associated with 
      behavioral performance. Global measures of modular organization did not change with 
      working memory load but were associated with individual variability in behavioral 
      performance. These findings indicate that regional and global network properties are 
      modulated by different aspects of working memory under increasing load conditions. 
      These findings highlight the importance of assessing multiple features of functional 
      brain network topology at both global and regional scales rather than focusing on a 
      single network property.

TI  - The remediation effects of working memory training in schizophrenia patients with 
      prominent negative symptoms.

AB  - Introduction: Negative symptoms, particularly amotivation and anhedonia, are 
      important predictors of poor functional outcome in patients with schizophrenia. 
      There has been interest in the efficacy and mechanism of non-pharmacological 
      interventions to alleviate these symptoms. The present study aimed to examine the 
      remediation effect of working memory (WM) training in patients with schizophrenia 
      with prominent negative symptoms.Methods: Thirty-one schizophrenia patients with 
      prominent negative symptoms were recruited and assigned to either a WM training 
      group or a treatment-as-usual (TAU) control group. The WM training group underwent 
      20 sessions of training using the dual n-back task over one month. A functional 
      neuroimaging paradigm of the Affective Incentive Delay (AID) task was administered 
      before and after the training intervention to evaluate the remediation effect of the 
      intervention.Results: Our results showed that the WM training group demonstrated 
      significant improvement in the WM training task and inattention symptoms. Compared 
      with the TAU group, increased brain activations were observed at the right insula 
      and the right frontal sub-gyral after WM training in the training group.Conclusions: 
      These findings support the efficacy of WM training in ameliorating hedonic 
      dysfunction in schizophrenia patients with prominent negative symptoms.

AB  - A core symptom of mood disorders is cognitive impairment in attention, memory and 
      executive functions. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a candidate treatment for cognitive 
      impairment in unipolar and bipolar disorders (UD and BD) and modulates 
      cognition-related neural activity across a fronto-temporo-parietal network. This 
      report investigates predicting the pharmacological treatment from functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data using a supervised machine learning approach. 
      A total of 84 patients with UD or BD were included in a randomized double-blind 
      parallel-group study in which they received eight weekly infusions of either EPO (40 
      000 IU) or saline. Task fMRI data were collected before EPO/saline infusions started 
      (baseline) and 6 weeks after last infusion (follow-up). During the scanning 
      sessions, participants were given an n-back working memory and a picture encoding 
      task. Linear classification models with different regularization techniques were 
      used to predict treatment status from both cross-sectional data (at follow-up) and 
      longitudinal data (difference between baseline and follow-up). For the n-back and 
      picture encoding tasks, data were available and analyzed for 52 (EPO; n = 28, 
      Saline; n = 24) and 59 patients (EPO; n = 31, Saline; n = 28), respectively. We 
      found limited evidence that the classifiers used could predict treatment status at a 
      reliable level of performance (≤60% accuracy) when tested using repeated 
      cross-validation. There was no difference in using cross-sectional versus 
      longitudinal data. Whole-brain multivariate decoding applied to pharmaco-fMRI in 
      small to moderate samples seems to be suboptimal for exploring data driven neuronal 
      treatment mechanisms.

TI  - Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Modulates Neuronal Networks in Attention 
      Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.
PG  - 656-672
LID - 10.1007/s10548-017-0552-4 [doi]
AB  - Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the prefrontal cortex has 
      been repeatedly shown to improve working memory (WM). Since patients with attention 
      deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are characterized by both underactivation of 
      the prefrontal cortex and deficits in WM, the modulation of prefrontal activity with 
      tDCS in ADHD patients may increase their WM performance as well as improve the 
      activation and connectivity of the WM network. In the present study, this hypothesis 
      was tested using a double-blind sham-controlled experimental design. After 
      randomization, sixteen adolescents with ADHD underwent either anodal tDCS over the 
      left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, 1 mA, 20 min) or sham stimulation with 
      simultaneous fMRI during n-back WM task. Both in one-back and two-back conditions, 
      tDCS led to a greater activation (compared with sham stimulation) of the left DLPFC 
      (under the electrode), left premotor cortex, left supplementary motor cortex, and 
      precuneus. The effects of tDCS were long-lasting and influenced resting state 
      functional connectivity even 20 min after the stimulation, with patterns of 
      strengthened DLPFC connectivity after tDCS outlining the WM network. In summary, 
      anodal tDCS caused increased neuronal activation and connectivity, not only in the 
      brain area under the stimulating electrode (i.e. left DLPFC) but also in other, more 
      remote brain regions. Because of moderate behavioral effects of tDCS, the 
      significance of this technique for ADHD treatment has to be investigated in further 
      studies.

AB  - Impaired working memory is a core feature of schizophrenia and is linked with 
      altered engagement the lateral prefrontal cortex. Although altered PFC activation 
      has been reported in people with increased risk of psychosis, at present it is not 
      clear if this neurofunctional alteration differs between familial and clinical risk 
      states and/or increases in line with the level of psychosis risk. We addressed this 
      issue by using functional MRI and a working memory paradigm to study familial and 
      clinical high-risk groups. We recruited 17 subjects at ultra-high-risk (UHR) for 
      psychosis, 10 non-affected siblings of patients with schizophrenia (familial high 
      risk [FHR]) and 15 healthy controls. Subjects were scanned while performing the 
      N-back working memory task. There was a relationship between the level of 
      task-related deactivation in the medial PFC and precuneus and the level of psychosis 
      risk, with deactivation weakest in the UHR group, greatest in healthy controls, and 
      at an intermediate level in the FHR group. In the high-risk groups, activation in 
      the precuneus was associated with the level of negative symptoms. These data suggest 
      that increased vulnerability to psychosis is associated with a failure to deactivate 
      in the medial PFC and precuneus during a working memory task, and appears to be most 
      evident in subjects at clinical, as opposed to familial high risk.

AB  - The Val158Met (rs4680) single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the 
      catechol-O-methyltransferase gene (COMT) influences executive function and 
      prefrontal function through its effect on dopamine (DA) metabolism. Both HIV and the 
      Val allele of the Val158Met SNP are associated with compromised executive function 
      and inefficient prefrontal function. The present study used behavioral and 
      neuroimaging techniques to determine independent and interactive associations 
      between HIV serostatus and COMT genotype on working memory and prefrontal function 
      in women. For the behavioral study, 54 HIV-infected and 33 HIV-uninfected women 
      completed the 0-, 1-, and 2-back conditions of the verbal N-back, a working memory 
      test. For the imaging study, 36 women (23 HIV-infected, 13 HIV-uninfected) underwent 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) assessments while completing the N-back 
      task. HIV-infected women demonstrated significantly worse N-back performance 
      compared with HIV-uninfected women (p < 0.05). A significant serostatus by genotype 
      interaction (p < 0.01) revealed that, among Val/Val, but not Met allele carriers, 
      HIV-infected women performed significantly worse than HIV-uninfected controls across 
      N-back conditions (p < 0.01). Analogous to behavioral findings, a serostatus by 
      genotype interaction revealed that HIV-infected Val/Val carriers showed 
      significantly greater prefrontal activation compared with HIV-uninfected Val/Val 
      carriers (p < 0.01). Conversely, HIV-uninfected Met allele carriers demonstrated 
      significantly greater prefrontal activation compared with HIV-infected Met allele 
      carriers. Findings suggest that the combination of HIV infection and the Val/Val 
      COMT genotype leads to working memory deficits and altered prefrontal function in 
      HIV-infected individuals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Smartphone technology has enabled the creation of many working memory 
      training (WMT) Apps, with those peer-reviewed described in a recent review. WMT 
      claims to improve working memory, attention deficits, hyperactivity and fluid 
      intelligence, in line with plasticity brain changes. Critics argue that WMT is 
      unable to achieve "far-transfer"-the attainment of benefits to cognition from one 
      taught context to another dissimilar context-associated with improved quality of 
      life. However, brain changes after a course of WMT in frontoparietal and striatal 
      circuits-that often occur prior to behavioral changes-may be a better indicator of 
      far-transfer efficacy, especially to improve impulse control commonly dysregulated 
      in those with addictive disorders, yet not commonly examined in WMT studies. METHOD: 
      In contrast to previous reviews, the aim here is to focus on the findings of brain 
      imaging WMT training studies across various imaging modalities that use various 
      paradigms, published via PubMed, Scopus, Medline, and Google Scholar. RESULTS: 35 
      brain imaging studies utilized fMRI, structural imaging (MRI, DTI), functional 
      connectivity, EEG, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), cerebral 
      perfusion, and neurogenetic analyses with tasks based on visuospatial and auditory 
      working memory, dual and standard n-back. DISCUSSION: Evidence suggests that 
      repeated WMT reduces brain activation in frontoparietal and striatal networks 
      reflective of increased neural circuitry efficiency via myelination and functional 
      connectivity changes. Neural effects of WMT may persist months after training has 
      ended, lead to non-trained task transfer, be strengthened by auxiliary methods such 
      as tDCS and be related to COMT polymorphisms. WMT could be utilized as an effective, 
      non-invasive intervention for working memory deficits to treat impulse and affective 
      control problems in people with addictive disorders.

AB  - BOLD variability, which measures moment-to-moment fluctuations in brain signal, is 
      sensitive to age differences in cognitive performance. However, the effect of aging 
      on BOLD variability in the context of different cognitive demands is still unclear. 
      The current study examined how aging affects brain variability across cognitive 
      loads and the contribution of BOLD variability to working memory abilities. 
      Participants (N = 149, ages 20‒86) completed an fMRI n-back paradigm with 3 loads 
      and 10-minute resting state scan. We found that BOLD variability was greater during 
      rest compared to task and decreased even further as n-back load increased. Older age 
      was associated with smaller load-related modulations of BOLD variability in default 
      mode and fronto-parietal control networks. Increased variability in default mode, 
      fronto-parietal control, and limbic regions and decreased variability in 
      sensori-motor regions during the n-back task was associated with better working 
      memory performance, regardless of age. Our findings suggest that working memory 
      reductions in older ages are related to failure of core cognitive control and 
      default mode regions to modulate dynamic range of activity in the face of increased 
      demands.

TI  - Anterior cingulate cortex differently modulates frontoparietal functional 
      connectivity between resting-state and working memory tasks.

LID - 10.1002/hbm.24912 [doi]
AB  - The brain frontoparietal regions and the functional communications between them are 
      critical in supporting working memory and other executive functions. The functional 
      connectivity between frontoparietal regions are modulated by working memory loads, 
      and are shown to be modulated by a third brain region in resting-state. However, it 
      is largely unknown whether the third-region modulations remain the same during 
      working memory tasks or were largely modulated by task demands. In the current 
      study, we collected functional MRI (fMRI) data when the subjects were performing 
      n-back tasks and in resting-state. We first used a block-designed localizer to 
      define the frontoparietal regions that showed higher activations in the 2-back than 
      the 1-back condition. Next, we performed physiophysiological interaction (PPI) 
      analysis using left and right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and superior parietal 
      lobule (SPL) regions, respectively, in three continuous-designed runs of 
      resting-state, 1-back, and 2-back conditions. No regions showed consistent 
      modulatory interactions with the seed pairs in the three conditions. Instead, the 
      anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) showed different modulatory interactions with the 
      right MFG and SPL among the three conditions. While the increased activity of the 
      ACC was associated with decreased functional coupling between the right MFG and SPL 
      in resting-state, it was associated with increased functional coupling in the 2-back 
      condition. The observed task modulations support the functional significance of the 
      modulations of the ACC on frontoparietal connectivity.

AB  - Interest in the pathology of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\has focused on brain 
      network profiles of the dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC), given its role as a 
      principal control region. Both motor control and working memory tasks induce 
      dysfunctional dACC profiles in OCD. H H We contrasted dACC network profiles in OCD 
      and age-comparable controls during both tasks (from data collected in the same 
      participants). The motor task required participants to tap their right forefinger in 
      response to a flashing white probe; the memory task was a standard n-back (2-Back) 
      requiring participants to identify if a current stimulus was identical to the one 
      presented two items before it in the sequence. Network interactions were modeled 
      using Psychophysiological Interactions (PPI), a model of directional functional 
      connectivity. Inter-group analyses indicated a) that the motor control task evoked 
      greater dACC modulation than the working memory task, and b) that the modulatory 
      effect was significantly greater in the OCD group. We also investigated the 
      relationship between OCD symptom dimensions (lifetime obsession and lifetime 
      compulsion measured using the CY-BOCS) and dACC network profiles in OCD. This 
      analysis revealed a dichotomy between Obsessive-Compulsive symptom dimensions and 
      the degree of dACC modulation: primarily increased obsessions predicted increased 
      modulation during the motor control task, but primarily increased compulsions 
      predicted increased modulation during the working memory task. These results 
      re-emphasize the salience of the dACC in OCD, and the primacy of tasks of motor 
      control in evoking dACC pathology in the disorder.

AB  - Working memory (WM) refers to the holding and manipulation of information during 
      cognitive tasks. Its underlying neural mechanisms have been explored through both 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). 
      Trial-by-trial coupling of simultaneously collected EEG and fMRI signals has become 
      an important and promising approach to study the spatio-temporal dynamics of such 
      cognitive processes. Previous studies have demonstrated a modulation effect of the 
      WM load on both the BOLD response in certain brain areas and the amplitude of P3. 
      However, much remains to be explored regarding the WM load-dependent relationship 
      between the amplitude of ERP components and cortical activities, and the low 
      signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the EEG signal still poses a challenge to performing 
      single-trial analyses. In this paper, we investigated the spatio-temporal activities 
      of P3 during an n-back verbal WM task by introducing an adaptive wavelet denoiser 
      into the extraction of single-trial P3 features and using general linear model (GLM) 
      to integrate simultaneously collected EEG and fMRI data. Our results replicated the 
      modulation effect of the WM load on the P3 amplitude. Additionally, the activation 
      of single-trial P3 amplitudes was detected in multiple brain regions, including the 
      insula, the cuneus, the lingual gyrus (LG), and the middle occipital gyrus (MOG). 
      Moreover, we found significant correlations between P3 features and behavioral 
      performance. These findings suggest that the single-trial integration of 
      simultaneous EEG and fMRI signals may provide new insights into classical cognitive 
      functions.

AB  - A critical feature of the human brain that gives rise to complex cognition is its 
      ability to reconfigure its network structure dynamically and adaptively in response 
      to the environment. Existing research probing task-related reconfiguration of brain 
      network structure has concluded that, although there are many similarities in 
      network structure during an intrinsic, resting state and during the performance of a 
      variety of cognitive tasks, there are meaningful differences as well. In this study, 
      we related intrinsic, resting state network organization to reconfigured network 
      organization during the performance of two tasks: a sequence tapping task, which is 
      thought to probe motor execution and likely engages a single brain network, and an 
      n-back task, which is thought to probe working memory and likely requires 
      coordination across multiple networks. We implemented graph theoretical analyses 
      using functional connectivity data from fMRI scans to calculate whole-brain measures 
      of network organization in healthy young adults. We focused on quantifying measures 
      of network segregation (modularity, system segregation, local efficiency, number of 
      provincial hub nodes) and measures of network integration (global efficiency, number 
      of connector hub nodes). Using these measures, we found converging evidence that 
      local, within-network communication is critical for motor execution, whereas 
      integrative, between-network communication is critical for working memory. These 
      results confirm that the human brain has the remarkable ability to reconfigure its 
      large-scale organization dynamically in response to current cognitive demands and 
      that interpreting reconfiguration in terms of network segregation and integration 
      may shed light on the optimal network structures underlying successful cognition. 
      SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The dynamic nature of the human brain gives rise to the wide 
      range of behaviors and cognition of which humans are capable. We collected fMRI data 
      from healthy young adults and measured large-scale functional connectivity patterns 
      between regions distributed across the entire brain. We implemented graph 
      theoretical analyses to quantify network organization during two tasks hypothesized 
      to require different combinations of brain networks. During motor execution, 
      segregation of distinct networks increased. Conversely, during working memory, 
      integration across networks increased. These changes in network organization were 
      related to better behavioral performance. These results underscore the human brain's 
      ability to reconfigure network organization selectively and adaptively when 
      confronted with changing cognitive demands to achieve an optimal balance between 
      segregation and integration.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Major depressive disorder (MDD) patients show impairments of cognitive 
      functioning such as working memory (WM), and furthermore alterations during WM-fMRI 
      tasks especially in frontal and parietal brain regions. The calculation of a 
      polygenic risk score (PRS) can be used to describe the genetic influence on MDD, 
      hence imaging genetic studies aspire to combine both genetics and neuroimaging data 
      to identify the influence of genetic factors on brain functioning. We aimed to 
      detect the effect of MDD-PRS on brain activation during a WM task measured with fMRI 
      and expect healthy individuals with a higher PRS to be more resembling to MDD 
      patients. METHOD: In total, n=137 (80 men, 57 women, aged 34.5, SD=10.4years) 
      healthy subjects performed a WM n-back task [0-back (baseline), 2-back and 3-back 
      condition] in a 3T-MRI-tomograph. The sample was genotyped using the Infinium 
      PsychArray BeadChip and a polygenic risk score was calculated for MDD using PGC MDD 
      GWAS results. RESULTS: A lower MDD risk score was associated with increased 
      activation in the bilateral middle occipital gyri (MOG), the bilateral middle 
      frontal gyri (MFG) and the right precentral gyrus (PCG) during the 2-back vs. 
      baseline condition. Moreover, a lower PRS was associated with increased brain 
      activation during the 3-back vs. baseline condition in the bilateral cerebellum, the 
      right MFG and the left inferior parietal lobule. A higher polygenic risk score was 
      associated with hyperactivation in brain regions comprising the right MFG and the 
      right supplementary motor area during the 3-back vs. 2-back condition. DISCUSSION: 
      The results suggest that part of the WM-related brain activation patterns might be 
      explained by genetic variants captured by the MDD-PRS. Furthermore we were able to 
      detect MDD-associated activation patterns in healthy individuals depending on the 
      MDD-PRS and the task complexity. Additional gene loci could contribute to these 
      task-dependent brain activation patterns.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Older adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) experience poor 
      cognitive and behavioral outcomes as MDD occurs in the context of other age-related 
      brain changes. Patients with depression often have impairments on measures of 
      frontal lobe functioning such as working memory. Understanding the effects of 
      depression on cognitive functioning in older adults is important for the development 
      of treatment strategies that focus on cognitive changes as well as mood. METHODS: 
      Eleven older adults with current MDD and 12 nondepressed comparison participants 
      (all aged 60 years and older) performed the N-back test of working memory during 
      fMRI. RESULTS: Depressed older adults performed worse than nondepressed participants 
      on the N-back task. Depressed older adults had decreased lateral frontal and 
      parietal activation during the most difficult working memory load condition on the 
      N-back compared with nondepressed older adults. CONCLUSION: Cognitive dysfunction in 
      geriatric depression may be related to reorganization of brain networks involved in 
      working memory.

      functional magnetic resonance imaging task.

AB  - The diameter of the human pupil tracks working memory processing and is associated 
      with activity in the frontoparietal network. At the same time, recent neuroimaging 
      research has linked human pupil fluctuations to activity in the salience network. In 
      this combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)/pupillometry study, we 
      recorded the pupil size of healthy human participants while they performed a 
      blockwise organized working memory task (N-back) inside an MRI scanner in order to 
      monitor the pupil fluctuations associated neural activity during working memory 
      processing. We first confirmed that mean pupil size closely followed working memory 
      load. Combining this with fMRI data, we focused on blood oxygen level dependent 
      (BOLD) correlates of mean pupil size modeled onto the task blocks as a parametric 
      modulation. Interrogating this modulated task regressor, we were able to retrieve 
      the frontoparietal network. Next, to fully exploit the within-block dynamics, we 
      divided the blocks into 1 s time bins and filled these with corresponding pupil 
      change values (first-order derivative of pupil size). We found that pupil change 
      within N-back blocks was positively correlated with BOLD amplitudes in the areas of 
      the salience network (namely bilateral insula, and anterior cingulate cortex). Taken 
      together, fMRI with simultaneous measurement of pupil parameters constitutes a 
      valuable tool to dissect working memory subprocesses related to both working memory 
      load and salience of the presented stimuli.

AB  - Whether and how working memory disrupts or alters auditory selective attention is 
      unclear. We compared simultaneous event-related potentials (ERP) and functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses associated with task-irrelevant sounds 
      across high and low working memory load in a dichotic-listening paradigm. 
      Participants performed n-back tasks (1-back, 2-back) in one ear (Attend ear) while 
      ignoring task-irrelevant speech sounds in the other ear (Ignore ear). The effects of 
      working memory load on selective attention were observed at 130-210ms, with higher 
      load resulting in greater irrelevant syllable-related activation in 
      localizer-defined regions in auditory cortex. The interaction between memory load 
      and presence of irrelevant information revealed stronger activations primarily in 
      frontal and parietal areas due to presence of irrelevant information in the higher 
      memory load. Joint independent component analysis of ERP and fMRI data revealed that 
      the ERP component in the N1 time-range is associated with activity in superior 
      temporal gyrus and medial prefrontal cortex. These results demonstrate a dynamic 
      relationship between working memory load and auditory selective attention, in 
      agreement with the load model of attention and the idea of common neural resources 
      for memory and attention.

TI  - APOE-ε4 Allele Altered the Rest-Stimulus Interactions in Healthy Middle-Aged Adults.
PG  - e0128442

LID - e0128442
AB  - The apolipoprotein E-ε4 allele is a well-known genetic risk factor for late-onset 
      Alzheimer's disease, which also impacts the cognitive functions and brain network 
      connectivity in healthy middle-aged adults without dementia. Previous studies mainly 
      focused on the effects of apolipoprotein E-ε4 allele on single index using task or 
      resting-state fMRI. However, how these evoked and spontaneous BOLD indices interact 
      with each other remains largely unknown. Therefore, we evaluated the 'rest-stimulus 
      interaction' between working-memory activation and resting-state connectivity in 
      middle-aged apolipoprotein E-ε4 carriers (n=9) and non-carriers (n=8). Four n-back 
      task scans (n = 0, 1, 2, 3) and one resting-state scan were acquired at a 3T 
      clinical MRI scanner. The working-memory beta maps of low-, moderate-, and 
      high-memory loads and resting-state connectivity maps of default mode, executive 
      control, and hippocampal networks were derived and compared between groups. 
      Apolipoprotein E-ε4 carriers presented declined working-memory activation in the 
      high-memory load across whole brain regions and reduced hippocampal connectivity 
      compared with non-carriers. In addition, disrupted rest-stimulus interactions were 
      found in the right anterior insula and bilateral parahippocampal regions for 
      middle-aged adults with apolipoprotein E-ε4 allele. The rest-stimulus interaction 
      improved the detectability of network integrity changes in apolipoprotein E-ε4 
      carriers, demonstrating the disrupted intrinsic connectivity within the 
      executive-functional regions and the modulated memory-encoding capability within 
      hippocampus-related regions.

AB  - Cognitive impairments in bipolar disorder (BD) are prevalent but effective 
      treatments with replicated and lasting pro-cognitive effects are lacking. Treatment 
      development is hampered by a lack of neurocircuitry biomarkers to predict treatment 
      efficacy. Action-Based Cognitive Remediation (ABCR) improves executive function in 
      BD and this was accompanied by increased dorsal prefrontal cortex (dPFC) response 
      during working memory (WM) after two weeks of treatment. This study investigated 
      whether pre-treatment WM-related dPFC response, executive dysfunction and/or 
      subjective cognitive difficulties predicted ABCR treatment response on executive 
      functions. Forty-five patients with fully or partially remitted BD (ABCR: n = 25, 
      control treatment: n = 20) in our ABCR trial completed a spatial N-back WM task 
      during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at baseline. Patients also 
      completed neuropsychological tests and rated their cognitive functions before and 
      after 10 weeks of ABCR or control treatment. Multiple linear regression analyses 
      were conducted to assess whether pre-treatment dPFC response, objective executive 
      impairment and/or subjective cognitive difficulties predicted greater ABCR-related 
      improvements of executive function. We found that treatment-related improvement in 
      executive function was predicted by more WM-related dPFC hypo-activity at baseline 
      (p = 0.03) in linear regression analyses adjusted for age, gender and education. In 
      contrast, there was only a non-significant trend towards more executive dysfunction 
      at baseline predicting greater ABCR-related executive improvement (p = 0.08). 
      Subjective cognitive difficulties at baseline showed no association with treatment 
      effects (p = 0.16). In conclusion, pre-treatment dPFC hypo-activity during WM 
      performance predicts greater effects of ABCR treatment on executive function and may 
      represent a neurocircuitry biomarker for treatment efficacy in this cognitive 
      domain.

AB  - Pornography has been repeatedly at the centre of public attention and has been 
      controversially discussed for a long time. However, little is known about the 
      connection between pornographic stimuli and individual (neuronal) processing of 
      attention and memory. Here, the impact and neural underpinnings of pornographic 
      pictures on working memory processes in a sample of subjects with compulsive sexual 
      behaviour was investigated. Therefore, whilst using functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI), a letter n-back task with neutral or pornographic pictures in the 
      background was employed in 38 patients and 31 healthy controls. On the behavioural 
      level, patients were slowed down by pornographic material depending on their 
      pornography consumption in the last week, which was reflected by a higher activation 
      in the lingual gyrus. In addition, the lingual gyrus showed a higher functional 
      connectivity to the insula during processing of pornographic stimuli in the patient 
      group. In contrast, healthy subjects showed faster responses when confronted with 
      pornographic pictures only with high cognitive load. Also, patients showed a better 
      memory for pornographic pictures in a surprise recognition task compared to 
      controls, speaking for a higher relevance of pornographic material in the patient 
      group. These findings are in line with the incentive salience theory of addiction, 
      especially the higher functional connectivity to the salience network with the 
      insula as a key hub and the higher lingual activity during processing of 
      pornographic pictures depending on recent pornography consumption.

TI  - Changes in effective connectivity according to working memory load: an FMRI study of 
      face and location working memory tasks.
PG  - 283-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The functional strategic mechanisms in the brain during performing 
      visuospatial working memory tasks, especially tasks with heavy load, are 
      controversial. We conducted the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while 
      sixteen subjects were performing face- and location-matching n-back tasks to examine 
      causal relations within the frontoparietal networks. METHODS: We applied a 
      sophisticated method, the structural equation modeling (SEM), to the fMRI data. The 
      imaging data were analyzed by extracting the task-related eigenseries using the 
      principal component analysis (PCA) and then by applying a form of data-driven model 
      called the automated search method. RESULTS: The SEM analyses revealed a functional 
      shift of network connectivity from the right to the left hemisphere with increasing 
      load in the face-matching n-back tasks while the location-matching tasks required 
      bilateral activation. In the locating matching n-back tasks, a pattern of parallel 
      processing was observed in the left phonological loop and the right inferior 
      parietal regions. Furthermore, object working memory-related activities in the left 
      hemisphere reliably contributed to performance of both the face- and 
      location-matching 2-back tasks. CONCLUSION: Our results are consistent with previous 
      reports in terms of demonstrating parallel and distributed information processing 
      during performing working memory tasks with heavy loads. Our results additionally 
      suggest a dynamic shift between the fast imagery circuit (right hemisphere) and the 
      stable verbal circuit (left hemisphere), depending on task load.

AB  - Postpartum working memory decline has been investigated mostly with 
      neuropsychological tests, but neural evidence is almost unknown. Here we 
      investigated task-related neural alterations during working memory task (n-back) and 
      intrinsic alterations during resting-state (rs) in postpartum women using functional 
      MRI (fMRI). Behaviorally, postpartum women showed comparable working memory 
      performances to the controls although there was a tendency of prolonged response 
      time. fMRI analysis results showed hyper-activation in regions belong to the task 
      positive network (TPN) during the task and hypo-rsfMRI values in the default mode 
      network (DMN) regions during rest in postpartum women. Based on these results, we 
      performed network connectivity analysis using nodes of the TPN and DMN. As a result, 
      the DMN showed a tendency of decreased connectivity in postpartum women during the 
      working memory process compared to the controls. Our results suggest that postpartum 
      women might have functional alterations in the DMN, and that hyper-activation in the 
      TPN during a task might be a compensatory mechanism to maintain working memory 
      performance in postpartum women.

TI  - Personality predicts brain responses to cognitive demands.
PG  - 10636-41
AB  - Eysenck (1981) proposed that the personality dimension of introversion- extraversion 
      (E) reflects individual differences in a cortical arousal system modulated by 
      reticulothalamic- cortical pathways: it is chronically more active in introverts 
      relative to extraverts and influences cognitive performance in interaction with task 
      parameters. A circuit with connections to this system, including the dorsolateral 
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate (AC) cortex, has been identified in 
      studies applying functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to a broad range of 
      cognitive tasks. We examined the influence of E, assessed with the Eysenck 
      Personality Questionnaire-Revised (Eysenck and Eysenck, 1991), in fMRI activity 
      during an "n-back" task involving four memory loads (0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-back) and a 
      rest condition in healthy men. To confirm the specificity of E effects, we also 
      examined the effects of neuroticism and psychoticism (P) scores. We observed that, 
      as predicted by Eysenck's model, the higher the E score, the greater the change in 
      fMRI signal from rest to the 3-back condition in the DLPFC and AC. In addition, E 
      scores were negatively associated with resting fMRI signals in the thalamus and 
      Broca's area extending to Wernicke's area, supporting the hypothesized (negative) 
      relationship between E and resting arousal. P scores negatively correlated with 
      resting fMRI signal in the globus pallidus-putamen, extending previous findings of a 
      negative relationship of schizotypy to striatal activity seen with older 
      neuroimaging modalities to fMRI. These observations suggest that individual 
      differences affect brain responses during cognitive activity and at rest and provide 
      evidence for the hypothesized neurobiological basis of personality.

TI  - Sensitivity of fNIRS to cognitive state and load.
PG  - 76
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00076 [doi]
LID - 76
AB  - Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an emerging low-cost noninvasive 
      neuroimaging technique that measures cortical bloodflow. While fNIRS has gained 
      interest as a potential alternative to fMRI for use with clinical and pediatric 
      populations, it remains unclear whether fNIRS has the necessary sensitivity to serve 
      as a replacement for fMRI. The present study set out to examine whether fNIRS has 
      the sensitivity to detect linear changes in activation and functional connectivity 
      in response to cognitive load, and functional connectivity changes when 
      transitioning from a task-free resting state to a task. Sixteen young adult subjects 
      were scanned with a continuous-wave fNIRS system during a 10-min resting-state scan 
      followed by a letter n-back task with three load conditions. Five optical probes 
      were placed over frontal and parietal cortices, covering bilateral dorsolateral PFC 
      (dlPFC), bilateral ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC), frontopolar cortex (FP), and bilateral 
      parietal cortex. Activation was found to scale linearly with working memory load in 
      bilateral prefrontal cortex. Functional connectivity increased with increasing 
      n-back loads for fronto-parietal, interhemispheric dlPFC, and local connections. 
      Functional connectivity differed between the resting state scan and the n-back scan, 
      with fronto-parietal connectivity greater during the n-back, and interhemispheric 
      vlPFC connectivity greater during rest. These results demonstrate that fNIRS is 
      sensitive to both cognitive load and state, suggesting that fNIRS is well-suited to 
      explore the full complement of neuroimaging research questions and will serve as a 
      viable alternative to fMRI.

AB  - Morning-type individuals experience more difficulties to maintain optimal 
      attentional performance throughout a normal waking day than evening types. However, 
      time-of-day modulations may differ across cognitive domains. Using functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated how chronotype and time of day 
      interact with working memory at different levels of cognitive load/complexity in a 
      N-back paradigm (N0-, N2-, and N3-back levels). Extreme morning- and evening-type 
      individuals underwent two fMRI sessions during N-back performance, one 1.5 h 
      (morning) and one 10.5 h (evening) after wake-up time scheduled according to their 
      habitual sleep-wake preference. At the behavioral level, increasing working memory 
      load resulted in lower accuracy while chronotype and time of day only exerted a 
      marginal impact on performance. Analyses of neuroimaging data disclosed an 
      interaction between chronotype, time of day, and the modulation of cerebral activity 
      by working memory load in the thalamus and in the middle frontal cortex. In the 
      subjective evening hours, evening types exhibited higher thalamic activity than 
      morning types at the highest working memory load condition only (N3-back). 
      Conversely, morning-type individuals exhibited higher activity than evening-type 
      participants in the middle frontal gyrus during the morning session in the N3-back 
      condition. Our data emphasize interindividual differences in time-of-day preferences 
      and underlying cerebral activity, which should be taken into account when 
      investigating vigilance state effects in task-related brain activity. These results 
      support the hypothesis that higher task complexity leads to a chronotype-dependent 
      increase in thalamic and frontal brain activity, permitting stabilization of working 
      memory performance across the day.

      with altered working memory-related prefrontal cortex activity: A longitudinal fMRI 
      study.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bipolar disorder (BD) is often accompanied by trait-related cognitive 
      impairments, but it is unclear which neurocircuitry abnormalities give rise to these 
      impairments and whether neurocircuitry differences are exacerbated with illness 
      progression. This longitudinal fMRI study of recently diagnosed BD patients 
      investigates whether aberrant working memory (WM) related activity in the cognitive 
      control network is accentuated by new affective episodes. METHODS: Forty-seven 
      recently diagnosed BD patients in full or partial remission and 38 healthy controls 
      were assessed with neurocognitive tests and fMRI during the performance of a verbal 
      n-back WM task at baseline and follow-up (15.4 months in average). RESULTS: Patients 
      showed WM-related hypo-activity in dorsal prefrontal cortex (dPFC) and impaired 
      cognitive function within attention and psychomotor speed, WM and executive 
      function, and verbal learning and memory compared to controls at baseline. During 
      the follow-up period, 26 patients experienced at least one affective episode (BD+), 
      while 21 remained in remission (BD-). There was no deterioration in cognitive 
      performance in BD+ compared to BD- patients. Nevertheless, BD+ displayed increased 
      WM-related dPFC activity at follow-up compared with BD- patients. This change in 
      dPFC response was independent of mood symptoms and medication. LIMITATIONS: The 
      study did not account for type or frequency of affective episodes. CONCLUSION: The 
      study identifies cognitive impairment and WM-related hypo-activity in dPFC early 
      during the course of BD. Increased high-load WM related dPFC activity over the 
      follow-up period in BD+ versus BD- patients in the absence of changes in cognitive 
      performance may reflect an episode-related reduction in PFC efficiency.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is a recreational drug associated with 
      increasing numbers of GHB-dependent patients and emergency attendances often related 
      to GHB-induced comas. Working memory (WM) deficits have been reported in association 
      with GHB use, and animal studies have shown that GHB induces oxidative stress in 
      vulnerable WM-related brain areas such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
      (DLPFC). However, the effects of chronic GHB use and multiple GHB-induced comas on 
      WM-related brain function in humans remains unknown. METHODS: We recruited 27 GHB 
      users with ≥4 GHB-induced comas (GHB-Coma), 27 GHB users who never experienced 
      GHB-induced coma (GHB-NoComa), and 27 polydrug users who never used GHB (No-GHB). 
      Participants performed an n-back WM task during functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) to probe DLPFC functioning. RESULTS: The GHB-Coma group had lower 
      premorbid IQ (p = .006) than the GHB-NoComa group despite comparable age and 
      education level. There were also group differences in the use of other drugs than 
      GHB. Therefore, all group comparisons were adjusted for IQ and drug use other than 
      GHB. Compared with the GHB-NoComa and the No-GHB groups, the GHB-Coma group showed 
      increased activity in the right DLPFC (p(SVC) = 0.028) and increased functional 
      connectivity of the right DLPFC with a cluster comprising the left anterior 
      cingulate and medial frontal gyrus (p(FWE) = 0.003). No significant fMRI differences 
      were observed between the GHB-NoComa and No-GHB groups. Due to technical problems, 
      no behavioural data were collected. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that multiple 
      GHB-induced comas, but not GHB-use per se, are associated with alterations in 
      WM-related brain function. Public awareness campaigns are required to minimize the 
      potential adverse effects induced by GHB recreational use, and especially 
      GHB-induced comas, even if no immediate side effects are experienced.

AB  - The study of brain networks, including those derived from functional neuroimaging 
      data, attracts a broad interest and represents a rapidly growing interdisciplinary 
      field. Comparing networks of healthy volunteers with those of patients can 
      potentially offer new, quantitative diagnostic methods and a framework for better 
      understanding brain and mind disorders. We explore resting state functional Magnetic 
      Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data through network measures. We construct networks 
      representing 15 healthy individuals and 12 schizophrenia patients (males and 
      females), all of whom are administered three drug treatments: i) a placebo; and two 
      antipsychotic medications ii) aripiprazole and iii) sulpiride. We compare these 
      resting state networks to a performance at an "N-back" working memory task. We 
      demonstrate that not only is there a distinctive network architecture in the healthy 
      brain that is disrupted in schizophrenia but also that both networks respond to 
      antipsychotic medication. We first reproduce the established finding that brain 
      networks of schizophrenia patients exhibit increased efficiency and reduced 
      clustering compared with controls. Our data then reveal that the antipsychotic 
      medications mitigate this effect, shifting the metrics toward those observed in 
      healthy volunteers, with a marked difference in efficacy between the two drugs. 
      Additionally, we find that aripiprazole considerably alters the network statistics 
      of healthy controls. Examining the "N-back" working memory task, we establish that 
      aripiprazole also adversely affects their performance. This suggests that changes to 
      macroscopic brain network architecture result in measurable behavioral differences. 
      This is one of the first studies to directly compare different medications using a 
      whole-brain graph theoretical analysis with accompanying behavioral data. The small 
      sample size is an inherent limitation and means a degree of caution is warranted in 
      interpreting the findings. Our results lay the groundwork for an objective 
      methodology with which to calculate and compare the efficacy of different treatments 
      of mind and brain disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Impaired working memory is thought to be a core feature of attention 
      deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Previous imaging studies investigating 
      working memory in ADHD have used tasks involving different cognitive resources and 
      ignoring the categorical judgments about objects that are essential parts of 
      performance in visual working memory tasks, thus complicating the interpretation of 
      their findings. In the present study, we explored differential neural activation in 
      children and adolescents with ADHD and in healthy controls using functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) with the categorical n-back task (CN-BT), which maximized 
      demands for executive reasoning while holding memory demands constant. METHODS: A 
      total of 33 drug-naive, right-handed male ADHD without comorbidity (mean age 9.9±2.4 
      years) and 27 right-handed, healthy male controls (mean age 10.9±2.7 years) were 
      recruited in the present study. Event-related fMRI was used to study differences in 
      brain activity during the CN-BT between the two groups. RESULTS: The two groups did 
      not differ in their accuracy in the CN-BT, although the ADHD patients showed 
      significantly shorter reaction times to correct responses than did the controls. 
      During the CN-BT, both ADHD patients and controls showed significant positive and 
      negative activations by the correct responses, mainly in the sensory-motor pathways 
      and the striato-cerebellum circuit. Additionally, the ADHD patients showed 
      significantly higher activation in the bilateral globus pallidus and the right 
      hippocampus compared with the controls. There was also a positive correlation 
      between hyperactivation of the left globus pallidus and the reaction time to correct 
      responses in ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to controls, ADHD patients showed neural 
      hyperactivation in the striatum and mediotemporal areas during a working memory task 
      involving categorization. Hyperfunction in these areas might be the 
      pathophysiological foundation of ADHD, related to the deficits of working memory and 
      the impulsive symptoms.

AB  - Adult functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) literature suggests that a 
      left-right hemispheric dissociation may exist between verbal and spatial working 
      memory (WM), respectively. However, investigation of this type has been obscured by 
      incomparable verbal and spatial WM tasks and/or visual inspection at arbitrary 
      thresholds as means to assess lateralization. Furthermore, it is unclear whether 
      this hemispheric lateralization is present during adolescence, a time in which WM 
      skills are improving, and whether there is a developmental association with 
      laterality of brain functioning. This study used comparable verbal and spatial WM 
      n-back tasks during fMRI and a bootstrap analysis approach to calculate 
      lateralization indices (LIs) across several thresholds to examine the potential of a 
      left-right WM hemispheric dissociation in healthy adolescents. We found significant 
      left hemispheric lateralization for verbal WM, most notably in the frontal and 
      parietal lobes, as well as right hemisphere lateralization for spatial WM, seen in 
      frontal and temporal cortices. Although no significant relationships were observed 
      between LI and age or LI and performance, significant age-related patterns of brain 
      activity were demonstrated during both verbal and spatial WM. Specifically, 
      increased adolescent age was associated with less activity in the default mode brain 
      network during verbal WM. In contrast, increased adolescent age was associated with 
      greater activity in task-positive posterior parietal cortex during spatial working 
      memory. Our findings highlight the importance of utilizing non-biased statistical 
      methods and comparable tasks for determining patterns of functional lateralization. 
      Our findings also suggest that, while a left-right hemispheric dissociation of 
      verbal and spatial WM is apparent by early adolescence, age-related changes in 
      functional activation during WM are also present.

AB  - Dopamine (DA) modulates corticostriatal connections. Studies in which imaging of the 
      DA system is integrated with functional imaging during cognitive performance have 
      yielded mixed findings. Some work has shown a link between striatal DA (measured by 
      PET) and fMRI activations, whereas others have failed to observe such a 
      relationship. One possible reason for these discrepant findings is differences in 
      task demands, such that a more demanding task with greater prefrontal activations 
      may yield a stronger association with DA. Moreover, a potential DA-BOLD association 
      may be modulated by task performance. We studied 155 (104 normal-performing and 51 
      low-performing) healthy older adults (43% females) who underwent fMRI scanning while 
      performing a working memory (WM) n-back task along with DA D(2/3) PET assessment 
      using [(11)C]raclopride. Using multivariate partial-least-squares analysis, we 
      observed a significant pattern revealing positive associations of striatal as well 
      as extrastriatal DA D(2/3) receptors to BOLD response in the 
      thalamo-striatal-cortical circuit, which supports WM functioning. Critically, the 
      DA-BOLD association in normal-performing, but not low-performing, individuals was 
      expressed in a load-dependent fashion, with stronger associations during 3-back than 
      1-/2-back conditions. Moreover, normal-performing adults expressing upregulated BOLD 
      in response to increasing task demands showed a stronger DA-BOLD association during 
      3-back, whereas low-performing individuals expressed a stronger association during 
      2-back conditions. This pattern suggests a nonlinear DA-BOLD performance 
      association, with the strongest link at the maximum capacity level. Together, our 
      results suggest that DA may have a stronger impact on functional brain responses 
      during more demanding cognitive tasks.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Dopamine (DA) is a 
      major neuromodulator in the CNS and plays a key role in several cognitive processes 
      via modulating the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Some studies 
      have shown a link between DA and BOLD, whereas others have failed to observe such a 
      relationship. A possible reason for the discrepancy is differences in task demands, 
      such that a more demanding task with greater prefrontal activations may yield a 
      stronger association with DA. We examined the relationship of DA to BOLD response 
      during working memory under three load conditions and found that the DA-BOLD 
      association is expressed in a load-dependent fashion. These findings may help 
      explain the disproportionate impairment evident in more effortful cognitive tasks in 
      normal aging and in those suffering dopamine-dependent neurodegenerative diseases 
      (e.g., Parkinson's disease).

AB  - The present pilot study investigated neuronal correlates of executive functioning in 
      patients previously diagnosed with recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD). The 
      aim of the study was to examine a partially remitted and remitted MDD patient group 
      with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using a cognitive activation 
      paradigm in order to probe aspects of response inhibition, attention shift, and 
      working memory. Twenty MDD patients and 19 healthy controls, matched for age and 
      sex, participated in the study. A working memory n-back task with single 
      presentations of incongruent Stroop words was used, with the instruction to either 
      remember the color of the ink the word was written in, or the color word itself, 
      presented two or three words back in the presentation series. MR images were 
      acquired on a 1.5-T GE Signa HD MR scanner. In addition to MR data, response time 
      (RT) and response accuracy (RA) behavioral data were recorded. The behavioral 
      results showed longer RT and lower RA in the MDD group compared to the control group 
      across instruction conditions and working memory load. Based on previous studies of 
      executive function, a composite region of interest (ROI) mask of the anterior 
      cingulate cortex (ACC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), caudate, and putamen 
      was used in statistical analysis. Significant activation was observed in controls 
      throughout this corticostriatal network. When compared to controls, patients showed 
      no significant difference in the level of activation in the ACC and the DLPFC. 
      However, in the putamen and caudate, hypoactivation in the patient group was 
      observed. It was concluded that these effects could be due to a scar effect as a 
      result of previous episodes of MDD.

TI  - Case-Based fMRI Analysis after Cognitive Rehabilitation in MS: A Novel Approach.
PG  - 78
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2015.00078 [doi]
LID - 78
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline in multiple sclerosis (MS) negatively impacts 
      patients' everyday functioning and quality of life. Since symptomatic 
      pharmacological treatment is not yet available alternative treatment strategies such 
      as cognitive rehabilitation are of particular interest. OBJECTIVES: To analyse the 
      ways in which MS patients respond to cognitive training, by combining behavioral and 
      fMRI data in a case-based triangulation approach. METHODS: Ten relapsing-remitting 
      (RR) MS patients aged between 39 and 58 years and between 1 and 8 years post MS 
      diagnosis were included. EDSS ranged from 1 to 3.5. Participants had normal to high 
      intelligence levels. Six patients were assigned to the training group (TG) and four 
      to the control group (CG) without intervention. The TG received a 4-week 
      computerized working memory (WM) training, consisting of 16 training sessions of 
      45 min duration each. Before and after the training a neuropsychological examination 
      and fMRI investigation by using an N-back task of different complexity was applied. 
      RESULTS: Patients in the TG responded differently to cognitive training. Four 
      participants did not meet the triangulation criteria for being treatment responders. 
      The two responders showed two distinct changes regarding activation patterns after 
      training: (I) decreased brain activation associated with increased processing speed 
      and (II) increased brain activation associated with higher processing speed and WM 
      performance. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of different and opposed response patterns 
      after the same training indicates a risk in applying classical group statistics. 
      Different and especially opposed patterns within the same sample may distort results 
      of classical statistical comparisons. Thus, underlying processes may not be 
      discovered and lead to misinterpretation of results.

TI  - Impact of Low-Level Blast Exposure on Brain Function after a One-Day Tactile 
      Training and the Ameliorating Effect of a Jugular Vein Compression Neck Collar 
      Device.
PG  - 721-734
LID - 10.1089/neu.2018.5737 [doi]
AB  - Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) personnel who conduct breacher exercises are at 
      risk for blast-related head trauma. We aimed to investigate the potential impact of 
      low-level blast exposure during breacher training on the neural functioning of 
      working memory and auditory network connectivity. We also aimed to evaluate the 
      effects of a jugular vein compression collar, designed to internally mitigate slosh 
      energy absorption, preserving neural functioning and connectivity, following blast 
      exposure. A total of 23 SWAT personnel were recruited and randomly assigned to a 
      non-collar (n = 11) and collar group (n = 12). All participants completed a 1-day 
      breacher training with multiple blast exposure. Prior to and following training, 18 
      participants (non-collar, n = 8; collar, n = 10) completed functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) of working memory using N-Back task; 20 participants 
      (non-collar, n = 10; collar, n = 12) completed resting-state fMRI. Key findings from 
      the working memory analysis include significantly increased fMRI brain activation in 
      the right insular, right superior temporal pole, right inferior frontal gyrus, and 
      pars orbitalis post-training for the non-collar group (p < 0.05, threshold-free 
      cluster enhancement corrected), but no changes were noted for the collar group. The 
      elevation in fMRI activation in the non-collar group was found to correlate 
      significantly (n = 7, r = 0.943, p = 0.001) with average peak impulse amplitude 
      experienced during the training. In the resting-state fMRI analysis, significant 
      pre- to post-training increase in connectivity between the auditory network and two 
      discrete regions (left middle frontal gyrus and left superior lateral 
      occipital/angular gyri) was found in the non-collar group, while no change was 
      observed in the collar group. These data provided initial evidence of the impact of 
      low-level blast on working memory and auditory network connectivity as well as the 
      protective effect of collar on brain function following blast exposure, and is 
      congruent with previous collar findings in sport-related traumatic brain injury.

AB  - Excessive brain iron negatively affects working memory and related processes but the 
      impact of cortical iron on task-relevant, cortical brain networks is unknown. We 
      hypothesized that high cortical iron concentration may disrupt functional circuitry 
      within cortical networks supporting working memory performance. Fifty-five healthy 
      older adults completed an N-Back working memory paradigm while functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed. Participants also underwent quantitative 
      susceptibility mapping (QSM) imaging for assessment of non-heme brain iron 
      concentration. Additionally, pseudo continuous arterial spin labeling scans were 
      obtained to control for potential contributions of cerebral blood volume and 
      structural brain images were used to control for contributions of brain volume. Task 
      performance was positively correlated with strength of task-based functional 
      connectivity (tFC) between brain regions of the frontoparietal working memory 
      network. However, higher cortical iron concentration was associated with lower tFC 
      within this frontoparietal network and with poorer working memory performance after 
      controlling for both cerebral blood flow and brain volume. Our results suggest that 
      high cortical iron concentration disrupts communication within frontoparietal 
      networks supporting working memory and is associated with reduced working memory 
      performance in older adults.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of gestational cocaine exposure on the prefrontal 
      cortex (PFC) with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). STUDY DESIGN: Using 
      an n-back task, we obtained fMRI with a 3T Siemens scanner on 49 adolescents, 25 who 
      were exposed to cocaine and 24 who were not exposed. The primary outcome was PFC 
      activation during task performance. Five functionally derived regions of interest 
      (ROI) were defined; in addition, 2 a priori anatomical ROIs were generated for 
      Brodmann regions 10 and 46. RESULTS: Of the 49 adolescents who underwent imaging, 
      data from 17 who were exposed to cocaine and 17 who were not exposed were in the 
      final analysis. Groups had similar performance on the n-back task (P >/= .4), with 
      both showing a fewer number of correct responses on the 2-back than the 1-back (P < 
      .001), indicating increased demands on working memory with greater task difficulty. 
      In functionally derived ROIs, imaging results showed increased activation for both 
      groups in the 2-back versus the 1-back condition. In anatomical ROIs, both groups 
      showed greater activation in the 2-back versus the 1-back condition, with activation 
      in the non-exposed group proportionally greater for the left prefrontal region (P = 
      .05). CONCLUSION: In this sample of adolescents, participants who were exposed to 
      cocaine and participants who were not exposed were similar in performance on an 
      executive function task and in fMRI activation patterns during task performance.

AB  - Amygdala function is of high interest for cognitive, social and psychiatric 
      neuroscience, emphasizing the need for reliable assessments in humans. Previous work 
      has indicated unsatisfactorily low within-subject reliability of amygdala activation 
      fMRI measures. Based on basic science evidence for strong habituation of amygdala 
      response to repeated stimuli, we investigated whether a quantification of 
      habituation provides additional information beyond the usual estimate of the overall 
      mean activity. We assessed the within-subject reliability of amygdala habituation 
      measures during a facial emotion matching paradigm in 25 healthy subjects. We 
      extracted the amygdala signal decrement across the course of the fMRI run for the 
      two test-retest measurement sessions and compared reliability estimates with 
      previous findings based on mean response amplitude. Retest-reliability of the 
      session-wise amygdala habituation was significantly higher than the evoked amygdala 
      mean amplitude (intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC)=0.53 vs. 0.16). To test 
      the task-specificity of this finding, we compared the retest-reliability of amygdala 
      habituation across two different tasks. Significant amygdala response decrement was 
      also seen in a cognitive task (n-back working memory) that did not per se activate 
      the amygdala, but was totally unreliable in that context (ICC~0.0), arguing for 
      task-specificity. Together the results show that emotion-dependent amygdala 
      habituation is a robust and considerably more reliable index than the mean 
      amplitude, and provides a robust potential endpoint for within-subject designs 
      including pharmaco-fMRI studies.

TI  - Fronto-cerebellar dysfunction and dysconnectivity underlying cognition in friedreich 
      ataxia: The IMAGE-FRDA study.
PG  - 338-50
LID - 10.1002/hbm.23034 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder defined by 
      pathology within the cerebellum and spinal tracts. Although FRDA is most readily 
      linked to motor and sensory dysfunctions, reported impairments in working memory and 
      executive functions indicate that abnormalities may also extend to associations 
      regions of the cerebral cortex and/or cerebello-cerebral interactions. To test this 
      hypothesis, 29 individuals with genetically confirmed FRDA and 34 healthy controls 
      performed a verbal n-back working memory task while undergoing functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging. No significant group differences were evident in task 
      performance. However, individuals with FRDA had deficits in brain activations both 
      in the lateral cerebellar hemispheres, principally encompassing lobule VI, and the 
      prefrontal cortex, including regions of the anterior insular and rostrolateral 
      prefrontal cortices. Functional connectivity between these brain regions was also 
      impaired, supporting a putative link between primary cerebellar dysfunction and 
      subsequent cerebral abnormalities. Disease severity and genetic markers of disease 
      liability were correlated specifically with cerebellar dysfunction, while 
      correlations between behavioural performance and both cerebral activations and 
      cerebello-cerebral connectivity were observed in controls, but not in the FRDA 
      cohort. Taken together, these findings support a diaschisis model of brain 
      dysfunction, whereby primary disease effects in the cerebellum result in functional 
      changes in downstream fronto-cerebellar networks. These fronto-cerebellar 
      disturbances provide a putative biological basis for the nonmotor symptoms observed 
      in FRDA, and reflect the consequence of localized cerebellar pathology to 
      distributed brain function underlying higher-order cognition.

TI  - Impaired temporoparietal deactivation with working memory load in 
      antipsychotic-naïve patients with first-episode schizophrenia.
PG  - 271-81
LID - 10.3109/15622975.2010.556199 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Neuroimaging studies have shown abnormal task-related deactivations 
      during working memory (WM) in schizophrenia patients with recent emphasis on brain 
      regions within the default mode network. Using fMRI, we tested whether 
      antipsychotic-naïve schizophrenia patients were impaired at deactivating brain 
      regions that do not subserve WM. METHODS: Twenty-three antipsychotic-naïve patients 
      with first-episode schizophrenia and 35 healthy individuals underwent whole-brain 3T 
      fMRI scans while performing a verbal N-back task including 0-back (no WM load), 
      1-back (low WM load), and 2-back (high WM load) conditions. RESULTS: Contrasting the 
      2-back and 0-back conditions revealed that patients deactivated default mode network 
      regions to a similar degree as controls. However, patients were impaired in 
      deactivating large bilateral clusters centred on the superior temporal gyrus with 
      increasing WM load. These regions activated with the no WM load condition (0-back) 
      in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Because 0-back activation reflects verbal attention 
      processes, patients' persistent activation in the 1-back and 2-back conditions may 
      reflect an inability to shift cognitive strategy with onset of WM demands. Since 
      patients were antipsychotic-naïve and task performance was equal to controls, we 
      infer that this impaired temporoparietal deactivation may represent a primary 
      dysfunction in schizophrenia.

AB  - Better-performing younger adults typically express greater brain signal variability 
      relative to older, poorer performers. Mechanisms for age and performance-graded 
      differences in brain dynamics have, however, not yet been uncovered. Given the 
      age-related decline of the dopamine (DA) system in normal cognitive aging, DA 
      neuromodulation is one plausible mechanism. Hence, agents that boost systemic DA 
      [such as d-amphetamine (AMPH)] may help to restore deficient signal variability 
      levels. Furthermore, despite the standard practice of counterbalancing drug session 
      order (AMPH first vs. placebo first), it remains understudied how AMPH may interact 
      with practice effects, possibly influencing whether DA up-regulation is functional. 
      We examined the effects of AMPH on functional-MRI-based blood oxygen level-dependent 
      (BOLD) signal variability (SD(BOLD)) in younger and older adults during a working 
      memory task (letter n-back). Older adults expressed lower brain signal variability 
      at placebo, but met or exceeded young adult SD(BOLD) levels in the presence of AMPH. 
      Drug session order greatly moderated change-change relations between AMPH-driven 
      SD(BOLD) and reaction time means (RT(mean)) and SDs (RT(SD)). Older adults who 
      received AMPH in the first session tended to improve in RT(mean) and RT(SD) when 
      SD(BOLD) was boosted on AMPH, whereas younger and older adults who received AMPH in 
      the second session showed either a performance improvement when SD(BOLD) decreased 
      (for RT(mean)) or no effect at all (for RT(SD)). The present findings support the 
      hypothesis that age differences in brain signal variability reflect aging-induced 
      changes in dopaminergic neuromodulation. The observed interactions among AMPH, age, 
      and session order highlight the state- and practice-dependent neurochemical basis of 
      human brain dynamics.

TI  - The interaction of working memory and emotion in persons clinically at risk for 
      psychosis: an fMRI pilot study.

AB  - Subtle emotional and cognitive dysfunctions may already be apparent in individuals 
      at risk for psychosis. However, there is a paucity of research on the neural 
      correlates of the interaction of both domains. It remains unclear whether those 
      correlates are already dysfunctional before a transition to psychosis. We used 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the interaction of working memory 
      and emotion in 12 persons clinically at high risk for psychosis (CHR) and 12 healthy 
      subjects individually matched for age, gender and parental education. Participants 
      performed an n-back task while negative or neutral emotion was induced by olfactory 
      stimulation. Although healthy and psychosis-prone subjects did not differ in their 
      working memory performance or the evaluation of the induced emotion, decreased 
      activations were found in CHR subjects in the superior parietal lobe and the 
      precuneus during working memory and in the insula during emotion induction. Looking 
      at the interaction, CHR subjects, showed decreased activation in the right superior 
      temporal gyrus, which correlated negatively with psychopathological scores. 
      Decreased activation was also found in the thalamus. However, an increase of 
      activation emerged in several cerebellar regions. Dysfunctions in areas associated 
      with controlling whether incoming information is linked to emotional content and in 
      the integration of multimodal information might lead to compensatory activations of 
      cerebellar regions known to be involved in olfactory and working memory processes. 
      Our study underlines that cerebral dysfunctions related to cognitive and emotional 
      processes, as well as their interaction, can emerge in persons with CHR, even in 
      absence of behavioral differences.

TI  - Neural correlates of working memory function in pediatric cancer survivors treated 
      with chemotherapy: an fMRI study.
PG  - e4296
LID - 10.1002/nbm.4296 [doi]
AB  - The goal of this study is to investigate the neural correlates of working memory 
      function associated with chemotherapy in pediatric cancer survivors using 
      event-related functional MRI (fMRI) analysis. Fifteen pediatric cancer survivors 
      treated with chemotherapy and 15 healthy controls were studied. Blood oxygenation 
      level dependent (BOLD) fMRI was acquired. A visual n-back task was used to test 
      working memory function during the fMRI scan. Responses were recorded via an MRI 
      compatible button box for analysis. fMRI scans were analyzed using statistical 
      parametric mapping software. All statistics were corrected for multiple comparisons 
      by false discovery rate, with p < 0.05 as significance. Patients however gave more 
      incorrect responses (p < 0.05), more no responses (p < 0.05), and longer response 
      times (p < 0.05) compared with healthy controls. Correct responses generated 
      significantly lower BOLD responses in the posterior cingulate for pediatric cancer 
      survivors compared with controls (p < 0.05). Incorrect responses generated 
      significantly greater BOLD responses in the angular gyrus in survivors (p < 0.05), 
      and no response trials generated greater BOLD responses within the superior parietal 
      lobule (p < 0.05) compared with controls. Working memory impairment appears to be 
      due to an inability to manipulate information and to retrieve information from 
      memory. The ability to delineate the affected neural circuits associated with 
      chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment could inform treatment strategies, 
      identify patients at high risk of developing cognitive deficits, and pre-emptively 
      tailor behavioral enrichment to overcome specific cognitive deficits.

TI  - Effect of fMRI acoustic noise on non-auditory working memory task: comparison 
      between continuous and pulsed sound emitting EPI.
PG  - 263-71
AB  - Conventional blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) based functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) is accompanied by substantial acoustic gradient noise. This 
      noise can influence the performance as well as neuronal activations. Conventional 
      fMRI typically has a pulsed noise component, which is a particularly efficient 
      auditory stimulus. We investigated whether the elimination of this pulsed noise 
      component in a recent modification of continuous-sound fMRI modifies neuronal 
      activations in a cognitively demanding non-auditory working memory task. Sixteen 
      normal subjects performed a letter variant n-back task. Brain activity and 
      psychomotor performance was examined during fMRI with continuous-sound fMRI and 
      conventional fMRI. We found greater BOLD responses in bilateral medial frontal 
      gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, left hippocampus, 
      right superior frontal gyrus, right precuneus and right cingulate gyrus with 
      continuous-sound compared to conventional fMRI. Conversely, BOLD responses were 
      greater in bilateral cingulate gyrus, left middle and superior frontal gyrus and 
      right lingual gyrus with conventional compared to continuous-sound fMRI. There were 
      no differences in psychomotor performance between both scanning protocols. Although 
      behavioral performance was not affected, acoustic gradient noise interferes with 
      neuronal activations in non-auditory cognitive tasks and represents a putative 
      systematic confound.

TI  - Neural dysfunction and violence in schizophrenia: an fMRI investigation.
PG  - 144-64
AB  - Contemporary theories and evidence implicate frontal lobe dysfunction in violent 
      behaviour as well as in schizophrenia. We applied functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) to investigate and compare brain activation during an 'n-back' 
      working memory task in groups of men with (i) schizophrenia and a history of serious 
      physical violence (VS; n=13), (ii) schizophrenia without a history of violence (NVS: 
      n=12), (iii) antisocial personality disorder (APD) and a history of serious physical 
      violence (n=10), and (iv) no history of violence or a mental disorder (n=13). We 
      observed comparable performance in all four groups during the control (0-back) 
      condition. Subtle working memory deficits were seen in the NVS and APD groups but 
      severe deficits emerged in the VS group relative to the healthy group. The VS group 
      showed activation deficit bilaterally in the frontal lobe and precuneus when 
      compared to the healthy group, and in the right inferior parietal region when 
      compared to the NVS group during the working memory load condition. Frontal 
      (bilateral) as well as right inferior parietal activity was negatively associated 
      with the ratings of violence across all schizophrenia patients, with the right 
      parietal region showing this association most strongly. APD patients, relative to 
      healthy subjects, showed activation deficit in the left frontal gyrus, anterior 
      cingulate and precuneus. It is concluded that reduced functional response in the 
      frontal and inferior parietal regions leads to serious violence in schizophrenia 
      perhaps via impaired executive functioning.

TI  - Effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Paired With Cognitive Training on 
      Functional Connectivity of the Working Memory Network in Older Adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Working memory, a fundamental short-term cognitive process, is known to 
      decline with advanced age even in healthy older adults. Normal age-related declines 
      in working memory can cause loss of independence and decreased quality of life. 
      Cognitive training has shown some potential at enhancing certain cognitive 
      processes, although, enhancements are variable. Transcranial direct current 
      stimulation (tDCS), a form of non-invasive brain stimulation, has shown promise at 
      enhancing working memory abilities, and may further the benefits from cognitive 
      training interventions. However, the neural mechanisms underlying tDCS brain-based 
      enhancements remain unknown. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: Assess the effects of a 2-week 
      intervention of active-tDCS vs. sham paired with cognitive training on functional 
      connectivity of the working memory network during an N-Back working memory task. 
      METHODS: Healthy older adults (N = 28; mean age = 74 ± 7.3) completed 10-sessions of 
      cognitive training paired with active or sham-tDCS. Functional connectivity was 
      evaluated at baseline and post-intervention during an N-Back task (2-Back vs. 
      0-Back). RESULTS: Active-tDCS vs. sham demonstrated a significant increase in 
      connectivity between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right inferior 
      parietal lobule at post-intervention during 2-Back. Target accuracy on 2-Back was 
      significantly improved for active vs. sham at post-intervention. CONCLUSION: These 
      results suggest pairing tDCS with cognitive training enhances functional 
      connectivity and working memory performance in older adults, and thus may hold 
      promise as a method for remediating age-related cognitive decline. Future studies 
      evaluating optimal dose and long-term effects of tDCS on brain function will help to 
      maximize potential clinical impacts of tDCS paired with cognitive training in older 
      adults. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT02137122.

TI  - BDNF Val66Met Polymorphism on Functional MRI During n-Back Working Memory Tasks.
PG  - e1586

AB  - Val66Met polymorphism on the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene is 
      associated with hippocampal pathology and impaired episodic memory. However, the 
      influence of this polymorphism on working memory (WM) performance and patterns of 
      brain activation is controversial. This study investigated the effects of BDNF 
      Val66Met polymorphism on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during n-back 
      WM tasks in healthy middle-aged adults.A total of 110 participants without 
      subjective or objective cognitive impairment underwent BDNF genotyping. Eleven Met 
      allele carriers and 9 noncarriers underwent fMRI during WM tasks.The WM performance 
      was similar between the 2 groups. Increased brain activation in response to 
      increases in WM loads was observed in both groups. The Met allele carrier group 
      showed consistently lower brain activation in the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG) 
      and the middle occipital gyrus than that of the noncarrier group (P < 0.001). No 
      brain region showed increased activation during WM tasks in the Met allele 
      group.BDNF Val66Met polymorphism may affect the WM network. Met allele carriers have 
      lower brain activation in the right SFG and middle occipital gyrus than do 
      noncarriers during WM tasks. Defective development of the WM network during brain 
      maturation or differentiation is a possible mechanism. Additional studies with a 
      larger sample and longer follow-up period are warranted.

TI  - Psychotic Experiences, Working Memory, and the Developing Brain: A Multimodal 
      Neuroimaging Study.
PG  - 4828-38
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhv181 [doi]
AB  - Psychotic experiences (PEs) occur in the general population, especially in children 
      and adolescents, and are associated with poor psychosocial outcomes, impaired 
      cognition, and increased risk of transition to psychosis. It is unknown how the 
      presence and persistence of PEs during early adulthood affects cognition and brain 
      function. The current study assessed working memory as well as brain function and 
      structure in 149 individuals, with and without PEs, drawn from a population cohort. 
      Observer-rated PEs were classified as persistent or transient on the basis of 
      longitudinal assessments. Working memory was assessed using the n-back task during 
      fMRI. Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) was used to characterize frontoparietal network 
      configuration and voxel-based morphometry was utilized to examine gray matter. Those 
      with persistent, but not transient, PEs performed worse on the n-back task, compared 
      with controls, yet showed no significant differences in regional brain activation or 
      brain structure. DCM analyses revealed greater emphasis on frontal connectivity 
      within a frontoparietal network in those with PEs compared with controls. We propose 
      that these findings portray an altered configuration of working memory function in 
      the brain, potentially indicative of an adaptive response to atypical development 
      associated with the manifestation of PEs.

AB  - Processing speed (PS) training improves performance on untrained PS tasks in the 
      elderly. However, PS training's effects on the PS of young adults and on neural 
      mechanisms are still unknown. In humans, we investigated this issue using 
      psychological measures, voxel-based morphometry, the n-back task [a typical task for 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies with conditions of 0-back 
      (simple cognitive processes) and 2-back tasks (working memory; WM)], resting-state 
      fMRI for the analysis of functional connectivity between brain regions during rest 
      (resting-FC), and intensive adaptive training of PS. PS training was associated with 
      (1) significant or substantial improvement in the performance of PS measures, (2) 
      changes in the gray matter structures of the left superior temporal gyrus and the 
      bilateral regions around the occipitotemporal junction, (3) changes in functional 
      activity that are related to simple cognitive processes (but not those of WM) in the 
      left perisylvian region, and (4) increased resting-FC between the left perisylvian 
      area and the area that extends to the lingual gyrus and calcarine cortex. These 
      results confirm the PS-training-induced plasticity in PS and the training-induced 
      plasticity of functions and structures that are associated with speeded cognitive 
      processes. The observed neural changes caused by PS training may give us new 
      insights into how PS training, and possibly other cognitive training, can improve 
      PS.

AB  - Adolescents and young adults with surgically treated congenital heart disease (CHD) 
      have been shown to exhibit difficulties with executive functions; however, the 
      neural underpinnings of these impairments have not been previously examined with 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The current study employed fMRI to 
      examine the neural mechanisms during a letter n-back task of working memory compared 
      to vigilance. Seventeen participants with CHD (M(age) = 17.76 ± 1.72 years; 88% 
      Caucasian; 30% female; mean IQ = 104.12 ± 15.15) were compared to 17 controls 
      (M(age) = 18.40 ± 1.74 years; 70% Caucasian; 30% female; mean IQ = 110.59 ± 5.28) 
      with similar declining performance as the n-back became more challenging. Overall, 
      both groups activated similar frontal-parietal working-memory networks as seen in 
      previous literature; however, some significant differences were detected between the 
      groups. Specifically, the participants with CHD demonstrated differences within the 
      left precuneus and the right inferior frontal gyrus. Secondary analyses indicated 
      that this difference appeared to be due to less task-induced deactivation (TID) in 
      the CHD group during working memory and greater working-memory TID in the control 
      group. In CHD, prefrontal fMRI deactivation on working-memory tasks correlated with 
      improved working-memory performance. Future complementary neuroimaging research with 
      functional connectivity is warranted to further examine the neural underpinnings of 
      disrupted executive function in the long-term outcomes of CHD.

AB  - Working memory (WM) is an important cognitive domain for everyday life functioning 
      and is often disturbed in neuropsychiatric disorders. Functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) studies in humans show that distributed brain areas typically 
      described as fronto-parietal regions are implicated in WM tasks. Based on data from 
      a large sample of healthy young adults (N = 1369), we applied independent component 
      analysis (ICA) to the WM-fMRI signal and identified two distinct networks that were 
      relevant for differences in individual WM task performance. A parietally-centered 
      network was particularly relevant for individual differences in task measures 
      related to WM performance ("WM dependent") and a frontally-centered network was 
      relevant for differences in attention-dependent task performance. Importantly, 
      frontal areas that are typically considered as key regions for WM were either 
      involved in both WM-dependent and attention-dependent performance, or in 
      attention-dependent performance only. The networks identified here are provided as 
      publicly available datasets. These networks can be applied in future studies to 
      derive a low-dimensional representation of the overall WM brain activation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Deficits in working memory (WM) are a core feature of schizophrenia (SZ) 
      and other psychotic disorders. We examined brain activity during WM in persons at 
      clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. METHODS: Thirty-seven CHR and 34 healthy 
      control participants underwent functional MRI (fMRI) on a 3.0T scanner while 
      performing an N-back WM task. The sample included a sub-sample of CHR participants 
      who had no lifetime history of treatment with psychotropic medications (n=11). Data 
      were analyzed using SPM8 (2-back>0-back contrast). Pearson correlations between 
      brain activity, symptoms, and WM performance were examined. RESULTS: The total CHR 
      group and medication-naive CHR sub-sample were comparable to controls in most 
      demographic features and in N-back WM performance, but had significantly lower IQ. 
      Relative to controls, medication-naïve CHR showed hyperactivity in the left 
      parahippocampus (PHP) and the left caudate during performance of the N-back WM task. 
      Relative to medication-exposed CHR, medication naïve CHR exhibited hyperactivity in 
      the left caudate and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). DLPFC 
      activity was significantly negatively correlated with WM performance. PHP, caudate 
      and DLPFC activity correlated strongly with symptoms, but results did not withstand 
      FDR-correction for multiple comparisons. When all CHR participants were combined 
      (regardless of medication status), only trend-level PHP hyperactivity was observed 
      in CHR relative to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Medication-naïve CHR exhibit hyperactivity 
      in regions that subserve WM. These regions are implicated in studies of 
      schizophrenia and risk for psychosis. Results emphasize the importance of medication 
      status in the interpretation of task - induced brain activity.

TI  - fMRI revealed neural substrate for reversible working memory dysfunction in 
      subclinical hypothyroidism.
PG  - 2923-30
AB  - Cognitive impairments have been found in thyroid hormone-related diseases (e.g. 
      hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism) for a long time. However, whether and how 
      subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) causes any deficits in brain functions, and whether 
      a hormone-replacement treatment is necessary for SCH patients, still remain 
      controversial subjects. In the present study, functional MRI (fMRI) was used to 
      measure brain functions by asking euthyroid subjects, hyperthyroid patients and SCH 
      patients to perform the widely used digit n-back working memory task. After having 
      been treated with l-thyroxine for approximately 6 months, the SCH patients were 
      asked to do the same fMRI experiment. The hypothyroid and SCH patients scored 
      significantly lower in the 2-back task than either the hyperthyroid patients or the 
      euthyroid subjects (P < 0.012). The fMRI showed that a common frontoparietal 
      network, including bilateral middle/inferior frontal gyri (M/IFG), bilateral 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), bilateral premotor areas (PreMA), the 
      supplementary motor area/anterior cingulate cortex (SMA/ACC) and bilateral parietal 
      areas (PA), was activated by the n-back task in all the subjects. Further 
      quantitative analysis showed that the load effect of blood oxygen level-dependent 
      (BOLD) response appeared in all the five regions of interest (ROIs) in the euthyroid 
      and hyperthyroid subjects. In the pre-treatment SCH patients, however, the load 
      effect of BOLD response was only found in the PA and PreMA, but not in other frontal 
      cortex ROIs [general linear model (GLM), F < 2.6, P > 0.1]. After an approximately 6 
      month treatment with LT4, the SCH patients exhibited the same load effects in all 
      five ROIs as the euthyroid subjects (GLM, F > 6, P < 0.05) along with an improvement 
      of performance in n-back task. These results suggest that working memory (but not 
      other memory functions) is impaired in SCH patients, mainly as far as disorders of 
      the frontoparietal network were concerned. Both the memory performance and frontal 
      executive functions were improved after an l-thyroxine-replacement treatment.

AB  - Only half of the geriatric patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) can reach 
      full remission after treatment of half a year. This study was designed to examine 
      the neural responses in the partial responders of late-onset MDD. We used 3-Tesla 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the patterns of cerebral 
      activation/deactivation in the performance of a one-back version of the n-back 
      working memory task. We recruited 14 major depressive patients who reached partial 
      remission after at least half a year of pharmacological intervention, compared with 
      14 non-depressive controls. There were no significant between-group differences in 
      the demographical profiles and working memory performance, which was true for both 
      accuracy and reaction time. Brain masks encompassing the neural responses of 
      activation/deactivation were constructed from the non-depressive controls. The 
      depressive group shows enhanced activities at left middle frontal and left parietal 
      regions, and reduced deactivation at several temporal regions and left amygdala 
      within the masks. Besides, the depressive group activates extra neural nodes at 
      middle frontal and middle temporal regions outside the masks. The neural responses 
      in the left amygdala are significantly correlated with the severity of depression 
      and comorbid anxiety. The loss of deactivation in the left amygdala and the temporal 
      areas in cognitive endeavor may be related to the refractoriness to treatment.

TI  - Polygenic risk for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) predicts brain response

AB  - Alterations in frontal and parietal neural activations during working memory task 
      performance have been suggested as a candidate endophenotype of obsessive-compulsive 
      disorder (OCD) in studies involving first-degree relatives. However, the direct link 
      between genetic risk for OCD and neuro-functional alterations during working memory 
      performance has not been investigated to date. Thus, the aim of the current 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to test the direct 
      association between polygenic risk for OCD and neural activity during the 
      performance of a numeric n-back task with four working memory load conditions in 128 
      participants, including patients with OCD, unaffected first-degree relatives of OCD 
      patients, and healthy controls. Behavioral results show a significant performance 
      deficit at high working memory load in both patients with OCD and first-degree 
      relatives (p < 0.05). A whole-brain analysis of the fMRI data indicated decreased 
      neural activity in bilateral inferior parietal lobule and dorsolateral prefrontal 
      cortex in both patients and relatives. Most importantly, OCD polygenic risk scores 
      predicted neural activity in orbitofrontal cortex. Results indicate that genetic 
      risk for OCD can partly explain alterations in brain response during working memory 
      performance, supporting the notion of a neuro-functional endophenotype for OCD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Determining the neurobehavioral profiles that differentiate heavy 
      drinkers who are and are not alcohol dependent will inform treatment efforts. 
      Working memory is linked to substance use disorders and can serve as a 
      representation of the demand placed on the neurophysiology associated with cognitive 
      control. METHODS: Behavior and brain activity (via fMRI) were recorded during an 
      N-Back working memory task in controls (CTRL), nondependent heavy drinkers (A-ND) 
      and dependent heavy drinkers (A-D). Typical and novel step-wise analyses examined 
      profiles of working memory load and increasing task demand, respectively. RESULTS: 
      Performance was significantly decreased in A-D during high working memory load 
      (2-Back), compared to CTRL and A-ND. Analysis of brain activity during high load 
      (0-Back vs. 2- Back) showed greater responses in the dorsal lateral and medial 
      prefrontal cortices of A-D than CTRL, suggesting increased but failed compensation. 
      The step-wise analysis revealed that the transition to Low Demand (0-Back to 1-Back) 
      was associated with robust increases and decreases in cognitive control and 
      default-mode brain regions, respectively, in A-D and A-ND but not CTRL. The 
      transition to High Demand (1-Back to 2-Back) resulted in additional engagement of 
      these networks in A-ND and CTRL, but not A-D. CONCLUSION: Heavy drinkers engaged 
      working memory neural networks at lower demand than controls. As demand increased, 
      nondependent heavy drinkers maintained control performance but relied on additional 
      neurophysiological resources, and dependent heavy drinkers did not display further 
      resource engagement and had poorer performance. These results support targeting 
      these brain areas for treatment interventions.

TI  - Dysfunctional prefrontal regional specialization and compensation in schizophrenia.
PG  - 1969-77
AB  - OBJECTIVE: It has been suggested that in healthy persons higher-order cognitive 
      processing engaged by incremental working memory load hierarchically employs more 
      dorsal than ventral prefrontal resources in healthy individuals. Given that working 
      memory performance is impaired in schizophrenia, especially at higher executive 
      loads, the authors investigated how this prefrontal functional organization might be 
      altered in disease, independent of performance deficits. METHOD: Using N-back 
      working memory functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, the authors 
      studied 15 patients with schizophrenia and 26 healthy comparison subjects. Subgroups 
      based on median performance accuracy at 2-back were analyzed; high performers 
      included eight schizophrenia patients and 14 comparison subjects, and low performers 
      included seven patients and 12 comparison subjects. RESULTS: High-performing but not 
      low-performing comparison subjects responded to incremental working memory executive 
      load with disproportionately greater dorsal but not ventral prefrontal cortex 
      activation, which also predicted performance accuracy. In the high- and 
      low-performing patient groups, incremental working memory load caused a 
      disproportionate increase in ventral but not dorsal prefrontal cortex activation 
      relative to the respective comparison group, which also correlated with accuracy. 
      Functional connectivity between the ventral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal 
      cortex was relatively greater in patients, whereas comparison subjects had greater 
      functional connectivity between the dorsal prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal 
      cortex. CONCLUSIONS: The hierarchical organization of the prefrontal cortex may be 
      compromised in schizophrenia, resulting in loss of functional specialization and 
      integration at the dorsal prefrontal cortex and in compensatory activation from the 
      ventral prefrontal cortex, which may ultimately affect working memory and executive 
      cognition.

TI  - Gender differences in creative thinking: behavioral and fMRI findings.
PG  - 39-51
LID - 10.1007/s11682-013-9241-4 [doi]
AB  - Gender differences in creativity have been widely studied in behavioral 
      investigations, but this topic has rarely been the focus of neuroscientific 
      research. The current paper presents follow-up analyses of a previous fMRI study 
      (Abraham et al., Neuropsychologia 50(8):1906-1917, 2012b), in which behavioral and 
      brain function during creative conceptual expansion as well as general divergent 
      thinking were explored. Here, we focus on gender differences within the same sample. 
      Conceptual expansion was assessed with the alternate uses task relative to the 
      object location task, whereas divergent thinking was assessed in terms of responses 
      across both the alternate uses and object location tasks relative to n-back working 
      memory tasks. While men and women were indistinguishable in terms of behavioral 
      performance across all tasks, the pattern of brain activity while engaged in the 
      tasks in question was indicative of strategy differences between the genders. Brain 
      areas related to semantic cognition, rule learning and decision making were 
      preferentially engaged in men during conceptual expansion, whereas women displayed 
      higher activity in regions related to speech processing and social perception. 
      During divergent thinking, declarative memory related regions were strongly 
      activated in men, while regions involved in theory of mind and self-referential 
      processing were more engaged in women. The implications of gender differences in 
      adopted strategies or cognitive style when faced with generative tasks are 
      discussed.

      Working Memory Network in Older Adults.

AB  - Working memory is an executive memory process essential for everyday decision-making 
      and problem solving that declines with advanced age. Transcranial direct current 
      stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive form of brain stimulation that has demonstrated 
      potential for improving working memory performance in older adults. However, the 
      neural mechanisms underlying effects of tDCS on working memory are not well 
      understood. This mechanistic study investigated the acute and after-effects of 
      bilateral frontal (F3/F4) tDCS at 2 mA for 12-min on functional connectivity of the 
      working memory network in older adults. We hypothesized active tDCS over sham would 
      increase frontal connectivity during working memory performance. The study used a 
      double-blind within-subject 2 session crossover design. Participants performed an 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) N-Back working memory task before, 
      during, and after active or sham stimulation. Functional connectivity of the working 
      memory network was assessed within and between stimulation conditions (FDR < 0.05). 
      Active tDCS produced a significant increase in functional connectivity between left 
      ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and left dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) during 
      stimulation, but not after stimulation. Connectivity did not significantly increase 
      with sham stimulation. In addition, our data demonstrated both state-dependent and 
      time-dependent effects of tDCS working memory network connectivity in older adults. 
      tDCS during working memory performance produces a selective change in functional 
      connectivity of the working memory network in older adults. These data provide 
      important mechanistic insight into the effects of tDCS on brain connectivity in 
      older adults, as well as key methodological considerations for tDCS-working memory 
      studies.

AB  - The default-mode network (DMN) comprises a set of brain regions that show 
      deactivations during performance of attentionally demanding tasks, but also 
      activation during certain processes including recall of autobiographical memories 
      and processing information about oneself, among others. However, the DMN is not 
      activated in a homogeneous manner during performance of such tasks, so it is not 
      clear to what extent its activation patterns correspond to deactivation patterns 
      seen during attention-demanding tasks. In this fMRI study we compared patterns of 
      activation in response to an autobiographical memory task to those observed in a 
      self/other-reflection task, and compared both to deactivations observed during the 
      n-back working memory task. Autobiographical recall and self-reflection activated 
      several common DMN areas, which were also deactivated below baseline levels by the 
      n-back task. Activation in the medial temporal lobe was seen during autobiographical 
      recall but not the self/other task, and right angular gyrus activity was 
      specifically linked to other-reflection. ROI analysis showed that most, but not all 
      DMN regions were activated above baseline levels during the autobiographical memory 
      and self-reflection tasks. Our results provide evidence for the usefulness of the 
      autobiographical memory task to study DMN activity and support the notion of 
      interacting subsystems within this network.

TI  - Is There Any Relationship Between Biochemical Indices and Anthropometric 
      Measurements With Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Activation Among Older Adults With 
      Mild Cognitive Impairment?

AB  - Working memory is developed in one region of the brain called the dorsolateral 
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The dysfunction of this region leads to synaptic 
      neuroplasticity impairment. It has been reported that several biochemical parameters 
      and anthropometric measurements play a vital role in cognition and brain health. 
      This study aimed to investigate the relationships between cognitive function, serum 
      biochemical profile, and anthropometric measurements using DLPFC activation. A 
      cross-sectional study was conducted among 35 older adults (≥60 years) who 
      experienced mild cognitive impairment (MCI). For this purpose, we distributed a 
      comprehensive interview-based questionnaire for collecting sociodemographic 
      information from the participants and conducting cognitive tests. Anthropometric 
      values were measured, and fasting blood specimens were collected. We investigated 
      their brain activation using the task-based functional MRI (fMRI; N-back), 
      specifically in the DLPFC region. Positive relationships were observed between 
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (β = 0.494, p < 0.01) and Mini-Mental State 
      Examination (MMSE) (β = 0.698, p < 0.01); however, negative relationships were 
      observed between serum triglyceride (β = -0.402, p < 0.05) and serum malondialdehyde 
      (MDA) (β = -0.326, p < 0.05) with right DLPFC activation (R (2) = 0.512) while the 
      participants performed 1-back task after adjustments for age, gender, and years of 
      education. In conclusion, higher serum triglycerides, higher oxidative stress, and 
      lower neurotrophic factor were associated with lower right DLPFC activation among 
      older adults with MCI. A further investigation needs to be carried out to understand 
      the causal-effect mechanisms of the significant parameters and the DLPFC activation 
      so that better intervention strategies can be developed for reducing the risk of 
      irreversible neurodegenerative diseases among older adults with MCI.

AB  - Impaired visuospatial working memory (VSWM) is suggested to be a core neurocognitive 
      deficit in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), yet the underlying 
      neural activation patterns are poorly understood. Furthermore, it is unclear to what 
      extent age and gender effects may play a role in VSWM-related brain abnormalities in 
      ADHD. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected from 109 
      individuals with ADHD (60% male) and 103 controls (53% male), aged 8-25 years, 
      during a spatial span working memory task. VSWM-related brain activation was found 
      in a widespread network, which was more widespread compared with N-back tasks used 
      in the previous literature. Higher brain activation was associated with higher age 
      and male gender. In comparison with controls, individuals with ADHD showed greater 
      activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the lateral frontal pole 
      during memory load increase, effects explained by reduced activation on the low 
      memory load in the IFG pars triangularis and increased activation during high load 
      in the IFG pars opercularis. Age and gender effects did not differ between controls 
      and individuals with ADHD. Results indicate that individuals with ADHD have 
      difficulty in efficiently and sufficiently recruiting left inferior frontal brain 
      regions with increasing task difficulty.

AB  - The drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme (CYP2D6) is highly expressed in 
      brain and potentially involved in neurotransmitter biotransformation. Here, we 
      report the effect of the CYP2D6 genotype on brain activation during a working memory 
      and an emotional face matching task measured with fMRI. Subjects were taken from an 
      ongoing large scale multicenter imaging genetic study. CYP2D6 genotyping of the 
      alleles *2, *3, *4, *5, *6, *9, *10, *17, *35, *41 and the duplication was performed 
      in N=114 healthy drug free individuals. All individuals had completed two tasks in 
      functional brain imaging: an n-back working memory task and an implicit emotional 
      face matching task. Contrast images were analyzed in second-level random effects 
      models with CYP2D6 enzyme activity levels as regressor of interest and age, sex and 
      scanning site as covariates. In the working memory task, a significant effect of 
      CYP2D6 genotype was found in the fusiform gyrus and the precuneus. In the emotional 
      face matching task, an effect was detected in the cuneus. No significant activation 
      results were found in the thalamus. A conjunction analysis confirmed a significant 
      joint effect of the CYP2D6 association in both regions. In both tasks activation 
      increased with increasing CYP2D6 activity. In conclusion, we confirmed a central 
      nervous system effect of CYP2D6 activity in a large independent sample using a 
      different imaging modality, and provide evidence that basic cognitive processes 
      related to such as alertness may be impacted.

      high-functioning ASD, we studied the rare case of a female patient with an 
      exceptional professional career in the highly competitive academic field of 
      Mathematics. According to the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach, which 
      proposes to describe the basic dimensions of functioning by integrating different 
      levels of information, we conducted four fMRI experiments targeting the (1) social 
      processes domain (Theory of mind (ToM) and face matching), (2) positive valence 
      domain (reward processing), and (3) cognitive domain (N-back). Patient's data were 
      compared to data of 14 healthy controls (HC). Additionally, we assessed the 
      subjective experience of our case during the experiments. The patient showed 
      increased response times during face matching and achieved a higher total gain in 
      the Reward task, whereas her performance in N-back and ToM was similar to HC. Her 
      brain function differed mainly in the positive valence and cognitive domains. During 
      reward processing, she showed reduced activity in a left-hemispheric frontal network 
      and cortical midline structures but increased connectivity within this network. 
      During the working memory task patients' brain activity and connectivity in 
      left-hemispheric temporo-frontal regions were elevated. In the ToM task, activity in 
      posterior cingulate cortex and temporo-parietal junction was reduced. We suggest 
      that the high level of functioning in our patient is rather related to the effects 
      in brain connectivity than to local cortical information processing and that 
      subjective report provides a fruitful framework for interpretation.

AB  - Working memory (WM)-related brain activity is known to be modulated by aging; 
      particularly, older adults demonstrate greater activity than young adults. However, 
      it is still unclear whether the activity increase in older adults is also observed 
      in advanced aging. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study 
      was designed to clarify the neural correlates of WM in advanced aging. Further, we 
      set out to investigate in the case that adults of advanced age do show age-related 
      increase in WM-related activity, what the functional significance of this 
      over-recruitment might be. Two groups of older adults - "young-old" (61-70 years, n 
      = 17) and "old-old" (77-82 years, n = 16) - were scanned while performing a visual 
      WM task (the n-back task: 0-back and 1-back). WM effects (1-back > 0-back) common to 
      both age groups were identified in several regions, including the bilateral 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the inferior parietal cortex, and the 
      insula. Greater WM effects in the old-old than in the young-old group were 
      identified in the right caudal DLPFC. These results were replicated when we 
      performed a separate analysis between two age groups with the same level of WM 
      performance (the young-old vs. a "high-performing" subset of the old-old group). 
      There were no regions where WM effects were greater in the young-old group than in 
      the old-old group. Importantly, the magnitude of the over-recruitment WM effects 
      positively correlated with WM performance in the old-old group, but not in the 
      young-old group. The present findings suggest that cortical over-recruitment occurs 
      in advanced old age, and that increased activity may serve a compensatory function 
      in mediating WM performance.

TI  - Alteration in Cerebral Activation during a Working Memory Task after Pediatric Mild 
      Traumatic Brain Injury: A Prospective Controlled Cohort Study.
PG  - 3274-3283
LID - 10.1089/neu.2018.6117 [doi]
AB  - Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) commonly occur in children and adolescents and 
      can result in persistent cognitive symptoms. The neurophysiological changes that 
      underlie persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS) have not been characterized. Our 
      objective was to compare working-memory related functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) response in children with persistent symptoms after mTBI at one month 
      post-injury to children with typical recovery and healthy controls. This was a 
      prospective, controlled cohort study of children with mTBI at one month post-injury. 
      PPCS was defined as children with a 10-point increase in their post-concussion 
      symptom inventory score (compared with pre-injury score) at one month post-injury 
      and a two-point increase in at least two symptom categories compared with 
      pre-injury. One hundred and seven participants (60 PPCS, 30 recovered mTBI, and 17 
      controls) with a mean age of 14.2 years (standard deviation [SD] 2.5) (44% male) 
      were assessed 38 (SD 5.9) days after mTBI. The primary outcome measures were 
      visuospatial n-back working memory task performance and fMRI blood oxygen level 
      dependent (BOLD) signal change. Children with PPCS had decreased activation relative 
      to children with typical recovery in the posterior cingulate and precuneus during 
      the one-back working memory condition, despite similar task performance. Differences 
      in cortical activation in children with PPCS at one month highlight the persistent 
      neurobiological consequences of pediatric mTBI on working memory cortical 
      activation. These findings encourage recommendations to avoid contact sports and 
      provide continued care at school for children with persistent symptoms at one month 
      post-injury.

LID - 58
AB  - Functional hemispheric asymmetries have been described in different cognitive 
      processes, such as decision-making and motivation. Variations in the pattern of 
      left/right activity have been associated with normal brain functioning, and with 
      neuropsychiatric diseases. Such asymmetries in brain activity evolve throughout life 
      and are thought to decrease with aging, but clear associations with cognitive 
      function have never been established. Herein, we assessed functional laterality 
      during a working memory task (N-Back) in a healthy aging cohort (over 50 years old) 
      and associated these asymmetries with performance in the test. Activity of lobule VI 
      of the cerebellar hemisphere and angular gyrus was found to be lateralized to the 
      right hemisphere, while the precentral gyrus presented left > right activation 
      during this task. Interestingly, 1-Back accuracy was positively correlated with left 
      > right superior parietal lobule activation, which was mostly due to the influence 
      of the left hemisphere. In conclusion, although regions were mostly symmetrically 
      activated during the N-Back task, performance in working memory in aged individuals 
      seems to benefit from lateralized involvement of the superior parietal lobule.

AB  - Humans possess unique social abilities that set us apart from other species. These 
      abilities may be partially supported by a large capacity for maintaining and 
      manipulating social information. Efficient social working memory might arise from 
      two different sources: chunking of social information or a domain-specific buffer. 
      We test these hypotheses with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) by 
      manipulating sociality and working memory load in an n-back paradigm. We observe (i) 
      an effect of load in the frontoparietal control network, (ii) an effect of sociality 
      in regions associated with social cognition and face processing, and (iii) an 
      interaction within the frontoparietal network such that social load has a smaller 
      effect than nonsocial load. These results support the hypothesis that working memory 
      is more efficient for social information than for nonsocial information, and suggest 
      that chunking, rather than a domain-specific buffer, is the mechanism of this 
      greater efficiency.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited information processing capacity in the brain necessitates task 
      prioritisation and subsequent adaptive behavioural strategies for the dual-task 
      coordination of locomotion with severe concurrent cognitive loading. Commonly 
      observed strategies include prioritisation of gait at the cost of reduced 
      performance in the cognitive task. Alternatively alterations of gait parameters such 
      as gait velocity have been reported presumably to free processing capacity for the 
      benefit of performance in the cognitive task. The aim of this study was to describe 
      the neuroanatomical correlates of adaptive behavioural strategies in cognitive-motor 
      dual-tasking when the competition for information processing capacity is severe and 
      may exceed individuals' capacity limitations. METHODS: During an fMRI experiment, 12 
      young adults performed slow continuous, auditorily paced bilateral anti-phase ankle 
      dorsi-plantarflexion movements as an element of normal gait at .5 Hz in single and 
      dual task modes. The secondary task involved a visual, alphabetic N-back task with 
      presentation rate jittered around .7 Hz. The N-back task, which randomly occurred in 
      0-back or 2-back form, was modified into a silent counting task to avoid confounding 
      motor responses at the cost of slightly increasing the task's general coordinative 
      complexity. Participants' ankle movements were recorded using an optoelectronic 
      motion capture system to derive kinematic parameters representing the stability of 
      the movement timing and synchronization. Participants were instructed to perform 
      both tasks as accurately as possible. RESULTS: Increased processing complexity in 
      the dual-task 2-back condition led to significant changes in movement parameters 
      such as the average inter-response interval, the coefficient of variation of 
      absolute asynchrony and the standard deviation of peak angular velocity. A 
      regions-of-interest analysis indicated correlations between these parameters and 
      local activations within the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) such that lower IFG 
      activations coincided with performance decrements. CONCLUSIONS: Dual-task 
      interference effects show that the production of periodically timed ankle movements, 
      taken as modelling elements of the normal gait cycle, draws on higher-level 
      cognitive resources involved in working memory. The interference effect 
      predominantly concerns the timing accuracy of the ankle movements. Reduced 
      activations within regions of the left IFG, and in some respect also within the 
      superior parietal lobule, were identified as one factor affecting the timing of 
      periodic ankle movements resulting in involuntary 'hastening' during severe 
      dual-task working memory load. This 'hastening' phenomenon may be an expression of 
      re-automated locomotor control when higher-order cognitive processing capacity can 
      no longer be allocated to the movements due to the demands of the cognitive task. 
      The results of our study also propose the left IFG as a target region to improve 
      performance during dual-task walking by techniques for non-invasive brain 
      stimulation.

TI  - Neural mechanisms of two different verbal working memory tasks: A VLSM study.

AB  - Currently, a distributed bilateral network of frontal-parietal areas is regarded as 
      the neural substrate of working memory (WM), with the verbal WM network being more 
      left-lateralized. This conclusion is based primarily on functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) data that provides correlational evidence for brain regions 
      involved in a task. However, fMRI cannot differentiate the areas that are 
      fundamentally required for performing a task. These data can only come from 
      brain-injured individuals who fail the task after the loss of specific brain areas. 
      In addition to the lack of complimentary data, is the issue of the variety in the WM 
      tasks used to assess verbal WM. When different tasks are assumed to measure the same 
      behavior, this may mask the contributions of different brain regions. Here, we 
      investigated the neural substrate of WM by using voxel-based lesion symptom mapping 
      (VLSM) in 49 individuals with stroke-induced left hemisphere brain injuries. These 
      participants completed two different verbal WM tasks: complex listening span and a 
      word 2-back task. Behavioral results indicated that the two tasks were only slightly 
      related, while the VLSM analysis revealed different critical regions associated with 
      each task. Specifically, significant detriments in performance on the complex span 
      task were found with lesions in the inferior frontal gyrus, while for the 2-back 
      task, significant deficits were seen after injury to the superior and middle 
      temporal gyri. Thus, the two tasks depend on the structural integrity of different, 
      non-overlapping frontal and temporal brain regions, suggesting distinct neural and 
      cognitive mechanisms triggered by the two tasks: rehearsal and cue-dependent 
      selection in the complex span task, versus updating/auditory recognition in the 
      2-back task. These findings call into question the common practice of using these 
      two tasks interchangeably in verbal WM research and undermine the legitimacy of 
      aggregating data from studies with different WM tasks. Thus, the present study 
      points out the importance of lesion studies in complementing functional neuroimaging 
      findings and highlights the need to consider task demands in neuroimaging and 
      neuropsychological investigations of WM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with poorer behavioral 
      performance in domains of working memory and associated cognitive systems for 
      cognitive control and attention. Functional neuroimaging studies show altered 
      functioning in MDD in frontal executive control circuits implicated in these 
      cognitive processes. It is not yet known whether poor cognitive performance 
      involving these circuits is part of the familial risk for MDD, and we addressed this 
      issue using a multi-modal imaging, behavioral and self-report approach in unaffected 
      first-degree relatives of parent probands with MDD. METHODS: 72 unaffected adult 
      first-degree relatives of probands with MDD (mean age 30.5 ± 13.4 years) with and 66 
      case-wise matched non-relative controls underwent functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging during performance of 'n-back' working memory task, a Go/No-go task 
      assessing cognitive control and an Auditory Oddball test of selective attention. 
      Groups were compared on imaging data analyzed voxel wise with a focus on 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and insula regions of 
      interest, and on corresponding behavioral accuracy and reaction time data. Symptoms 
      were assessed using self-report scales. RESULTS: Relatives were distinguished by 
      comparatively decreased activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
      (DLPFC) during updating of working memory. Behaviorally, relatives also showed more 
      errors of omission during working memory updating. DLPFC hypo-activation was 
      associated with greater depressive symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS: Deficits in 
      cognitive processing may be part of the profile of familial risk for depression, 
      preceding illness onset, specifically in the domain of working memory.

TI  - The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met genotype modulates working 
      memory-related dorsolateral prefrontal response and performance in bipolar disorder.
PG  - 214-224
LID - 10.1111/bdi.12497 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Cognitive dysfunction affects a substantial proportion of patients with 
      bipolar disorder (BD), and genetic-imaging paradigms may aid in the elucidation of 
      mechanisms implicated in this symptomatic domain. The Val allele of the functional 
      Val158Met polymorphism of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene is associated 
      with reduced prefrontal cortex dopamine and exaggerated working memory-related 
      prefrontal activity. This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study 
      investigated for the first time whether the COMT Val158Met genotype modulates 
      prefrontal activity during spatial working memory in BD. METHODS: Sixty-four 
      outpatients with BD in full or partial remission were stratified according to COMT 
      Val158Met genotype (ValVal [n=13], ValMet [n=34], and MetMet [n=17]). The patients 
      completed a spatial n-back working memory task during fMRI and the Cambridge 
      Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) Spatial Working Memory test 
      outside the scanner. RESULTS: During high working memory load (2-back vs 1-back), 
      Val homozygotes displayed decreased activity relative to ValMet individuals, with 
      Met homozygotes displaying intermediate levels of activity in the right dorsolateral 
      prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) (P=.016). Exploratory whole-brain analysis revealed a 
      bilateral decrease in working memory-related dlPFC activity in the ValVal group vs 
      the ValMet group which was not associated with differences in working memory 
      performance during fMRI. Outside the MRI scanner, Val carriers performed worse in 
      the CANTAB Spatial Working Memory task than Met homozygotes (P≤.006), with deficits 
      being most pronounced in Val homozygotes. CONCLUSIONS: The association between Val 
      allelic load, dlPFC activity and WM impairment points to a putative role of aberrant 
      PFC dopamine tonus in the cognitive impairments in BD.

TI  - Functional and connectivity changes during working memory in Huntington's disease: 
      18 month longitudinal data from the IMAGE-HD study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to characterize, for the first time, 18 month 
      longitudinal changes in both functional activation and functional connectivity 
      during working memory in premanifest Huntington's disease (pre-HD) and symptomatic 
      HD (symp-HD). METHODS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to 
      investigate longitudinal changes in neuronal activity during working memory 
      performance via an N-BACK task (0-BACK and 1-BACK) in 27 pre-HD, 17 symp-HD, and 23 
      control participants. Whole-brain analysis of activation and region-of-interest 
      analysis of functional connectivity was applied to longitudinal fMRI data collected 
      at baseline and 18 months follow-up. RESULTS: Compared with controls, the pre-HD 
      group showed significantly increased activation longitudinally during 1-BACK versus 
      0-BACK in the lateral and medial prefrontal, anterior cingulate, primary motor, and 
      temporal areas cortically, and caudate and putamen subcortically. Pre-HD far from 
      onset, compared with controls, showed further longitudinal increases in the right 
      and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Longitudinal increased activation 
      in anterior cingulate and medial primary motor areas were associated with disease 
      burden in the pre-HD group. Moreover, in pre-HD increased activation over time in 
      primary motor and putamen regions were associated with average response time during 
      1-BACK performance. During 1-BACK, functional connectivity between the right DLPFC 
      and posterior parietal, anterior cingulate, and caudate was significantly reduced 
      over 18months only in the pre-HD group. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal reductions in 
      connectivity over 18 months may represent an early signature of cortico-cortical and 
      cortico-striatal functional disconnectivity in pre-HD, whereas the concomitant 
      increased cortical and subcortical activation may reflect a compensatory response to 
      the demands for cognitive resources required during task performance. Our findings 
      demonstrate that functional imaging modalities have the potential to serve as 
      sensitive methods for the assessment of cortical and subcortical responses to future 
      treatment measures.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of exposure to dim light at 
      night (dLAN) when sleeping on functional brain activation during a working-memory 
      tasks. We conducted the brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis 
      on 20 healthy male subjects. All participants slept in a polysomnography laboratory 
      without light exposure on the first and second nights and under a dim-light 
      condition of either 5 or 10 lux on the third night. The fMRI scanning was conducted 
      during n-back tasks after second and third nights. Statistical parametric maps 
      revealed less activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) after exposure to 
      10-lux light. The brain activity in the right and left IFG areas decreased more 
      during the 2-back task than during the 1- or 0-back task in the 10-lux group. The 
      exposure to 5-lux light had no significant effect on brain activities. The exposure 
      to dLAN might influence the brain function which is related to the cognition.

TI  - Genetic Variation of a DRD2 Co-expression Network is Associated with Changes in 
      Prefrontal Function After D2 Receptors Stimulation.
PG  - 1162-1173
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhy022 [doi]
AB  - Dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs) contribute to the inverted U-shaped relationship 
      between dopamine signaling and prefrontal function. Genetic networks from 
      post-mortem human brain revealed 84 partner genes co-expressed with DRD2. Moreover, 
      eight functional single nucleotide polymorphisms combined into a polygenic 
      co-expression index (PCI) predicted co-expression of this DRD2 network and were 
      associated with prefrontal function in humans. Here, we investigated the non-linear 
      association of the PCI with behavioral and Working Memory (WM) related brain 
      response to pharmacological D2Rs stimulation. Fifty healthy volunteers took part in 
      a double-blind, placebo-controlled, functional MRI (fMRI) study with bromocriptine 
      and performed the N-Back task. The PCI by drug interaction was significant on both 
      WM behavioral scores (P = 0.046) and related prefrontal activity (all corrected P < 
      0.05) using a polynomial PCI model. Non-linear responses under placebo were reversed 
      by bromocriptine administration. fMRI results on placebo were replicated in an 
      independent sample of 50 participants who did not receive drug administration (P = 
      0.034). These results match earlier evidence in non-human primates and confirm the 
      physiological relevance of this DRD2 co-expression network. Results show that in 
      healthy subjects, different alleles evaluated as an ensemble are associated with 
      non-linear prefrontal responses. Therefore, brain response to a dopaminergic drug 
      may depend on a complex system of allelic patterns associated with DRD2 
      co-expression.

TI  - Working memory for letters, shapes, and locations: fMRI evidence against 
      stimulus-based regional organization in human prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 424-46
AB  - Investigations of working memory (WM) systems in the frontal cortex have revealed 
      two stimulus dimensions along which frontal cortical representations may be 
      functionally organized. One hypothesized dimension dissociates verbal from nonverbal 
      WM processes, dividing left from right frontal regions. The second hypothesized 
      dimension dissociates spatial from nonspatial WM, dividing dorsal from ventral 
      frontal regions. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to probe WM 
      processes associated with three different types of stimuli: letters (verbal and 
      nonspatial), abstract shapes (nonverbal and nonspatial), and locations (nonverbal 
      and spatial). In a series of three experiments using the "n-back" WM paradigm, 
      direct statistical comparisons were made between activation patterns in each 
      pairwise combination of the three stimulus types. Across the experiments, no regions 
      that demonstrated responses to WM manipulations were discovered to be unique to any 
      of the three stimulus types. Therefore, no evidence was found to support either a 
      left/right verbal/nonverbal dissociation or a dorsal/ventral spatial/nonspatial 
      dissociation. While this could reflect a limitation of the present behavioral and 
      imaging techniques, other factors that could account for the data are considered, 
      including subjects' strategy selection, encoding of information into WM, and the 
      nature of representational schemes in prefrontal cortex.

TI  - Flexible connectivity in the aging brain revealed by task modulations.
PG  - 3788-804
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22437 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies have shown that aging has a large impact on connectivity within and 
      between functional networks. An open question is whether elderly still have the 
      flexibility to adapt functional network connectivity (FNC) to the demands of the 
      task at hand. To study this, we collected fMRI data in younger and older 
      participants during resting state, a selective attention (SA) task and an n-back 
      working memory task with varying levels of difficulty. Spatial independent component 
      (IC) analysis was used to identify functional networks over all participants and all 
      conditions. Dual regression was used to obtain participant and task specific 
      time-courses per IC. Subsequently, functional connectivity was computed between all 
      ICs in each of the tasks. Based on these functional connectivity matrices, a scaled 
      version of the eigenvector centrality (SEC) was used to measure the total influence 
      of each IC in the complete graph of ICs. The results demonstrated that elderly 
      remain able to adapt FNC to task demands. However, there was an age-related shift in 
      the impetus for FNC change. Older participants showed the maximal change in SEC 
      patterns between resting state and the SA task. Young participants, showed the 
      largest shift in SEC patterns between the less demanding SA task and the more 
      demanding 2-back task. Our results suggest that increased FNC changes from resting 
      state to low demanding tasks in elderly reflect recruitment of additional resources, 
      compared with young adults. The lack of change between the low and high demanding 
      tasks suggests that elderly reach a resource ceiling.

TI  - A simple view of the brain through a frequency-specific functional connectivity 
      measure.
PG  - 279-89
AB  - Here we develop a measure of functional connectivity describing the degree of 
      covariability between a brain region and the rest of the brain. This measure is 
      based on previous formulas for the mutual information (MI) between clusters of 
      regions in the frequency domain. Under the current scenario, the MI can be given as 
      a simple monotonous function of the multiple coherence and it leads to an easy 
      visual representation of connectivity patterns. Computationally efficient formulas, 
      adequate for short time series, are presented and applied to functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) data measured in subjects (N=34) performing a working 
      memory task or being at rest. While resting state coherence in high (0.17-0.25 Hz) 
      and middle (0.08-0.17 Hz) frequency intervals is bilaterally salient in several 
      limbic and temporal areas including the insula, the amygdala, and the primary 
      auditory cortex, low frequencies (<0.08 Hz) have greatest connectivity in frontal 
      structures. Results from the comparison between resting and N-back conditions show 
      enhanced low frequency coherence in many of the areas previously reported in 
      standard fMRI activation studies of working memory, but task related reductions in 
      high frequency connectivity are also found in regions of the default mode network. 
      Finally, potentially confounding effects of head movement and regional volume on MI 
      are identified and addressed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is well known that lead exposure induces neurotoxic effects, which 
      can result in a variety of neurocognitive dysfunction. Especially, occupational lead 
      exposures in adults are associated with decreases in cognitive performance including 
      working memory. Despite recent advances in human neuroimaging techniques, the neural 
      correlates of lead-exposed cognitive impairment remain unclear. Therefore, this 
      study was aimed to compare the neural activations in relation to working memory 
      function between the lead-exposed subjects and healthy controls. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Thirty-one lead-exposed subjects and 34 healthy 
      subjects performed an n-back memory task during MRI scan. We performed fMRI using 
      the 1-back and 2-back memory tasks differing in cognitive demand. Functional MRI 
      data were analyzed using within- and between-group analysis. We found that the 
      lead-exposed subjects showed poorer working memory performance during high memory 
      loading task than the healthy subjects. In addition, between-group analyses revealed 
      that the lead-exposed subjects showed reduced activation in the dorsolateral 
      prefrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, pre supplementary motor areas, 
      and inferior parietal cortex. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that 
      functional abnormalities in the frontoparietal working memory network might 
      contribute to impairments in maintenance and manipulation of working memory in the 
      lead-exposed subjects.

PG  - 2398-406
LID - 10.1002/hbm.23181 [doi]
AB  - Recently, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CAMKK2 gene (rs1063843) was 
      found to be associated with lower expression of the gene in the dorsolateral 
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and with schizophrenia (SCZ) and deficits in working 
      memory and executive function. However, the brain mechanism underlying this 
      association is poorly understood. A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
      study (N = 84 healthy volunteers) involving multiple cognitive tasks, including a 
      Stroop task (to measure attentional executive control), an N-back task (to measure 
      working memory), and a delay discounting task (to measure decision making) to 
      identify the brain regions affected by rs1063843 was performed. Across all three 
      tasks, it was found that carriers of the risk allele consistently exhibited 
      increased activation of the left DLPFC. In addition, the risk allele carriers also 
      exhibited increased activation of the right DLPFC and the left cerebellum during the 
      Stroop task and of the left caudate nucleus during the N-back task. These findings 
      helped to elucidate the role of CAMKK2 in cognitive functions and in the etiology of 
      SCZ. Hum Brain Mapp 37:2398-2406, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

PG  - 65-79
LID - 10.3233/BEN-2010-0268 [doi]
AB  - Neuroimaging studies report cerebellar activation during both motor and non-motor 
      paradigms, and suggest a functional topography within the cerebellum. Sensorimotor 
      tasks activate the anterior lobe, parts of lobule VI, and lobule VIII, whereas 
      higher-level tasks activate lobules VI and VII in the posterior lobe. To determine 
      whether these activation patterns are evident at a single-subject level, we 
      conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during five tasks 
      investigating sensorimotor (finger tapping), language (verb generation), spatial 
      (mental rotation), working memory (N-back), and emotional processing (viewing images 
      from the International Affective Picture System). Finger tapping activated the 
      ipsilateral anterior lobe (lobules IV-V) as well as lobules VI and VIII. Activation 
      during verb generation was found in right lobules VII and VIIIA. Mental rotation 
      activated left-lateralized clusters in lobules VII-VIIIA, VI-Crus I, and midline 
      VIIAt. The N-back task showed bilateral activation in right lobules VI-Crus I and 
      left lobules VIIB-VIIIA. Cerebellar activation was evident bilaterally in lobule VI 
      while viewing arousing vs. neutral images. This fMRI study provides the first proof 
      of principle demonstration that there is topographic organization of motor execution 
      vs. cognitive/emotional domains within the cerebellum of a single individual, likely 
      reflecting the anatomical specificity of cerebro-cerebellar circuits underlying 
      different task domains. Inter-subject variability of motor and non-motor topography 
      remains to be determined.

LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhy344 [doi]
AB  - A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of the Matrix 
      Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) gene, rs3918242, has been shown to affect MMP9 expression 
      in macrophages and was associated with schizophrenia by two independent groups. 
      However, rs3918242's effects on MMP9 expression were not replicable in cell lines or 
      brain tissue. Additionally, publically available data indicate that rs3918242 
      genotype is related not to MMP9 expression, but rather to expression of SLC12A5, a 
      nearby gene coding for a K+/Cl- cotransporter, whose expression has also been 
      related to schizophrenia. Here, we studied brain structure and function in healthy 
      participants stratified by rs3918242 genotype using structural MRI (N = 298), 
      functional MRI during an N-back working memory task (N = 554), and 
      magnetoencephalography (MEG) during the same task (N = 190). We found rs3918242 was 
      associated with gray matter volume (GMV) in the insula and dorsolateral prefrontal 
      cortex bilaterally, closely replicated in discovery and replication samples; and 
      with inferior parietal lobule (IPL) GMV when the samples were meta-analytically 
      combined. Additionally, using both fMRI and MEG, rs3918242 was associated with right 
      IPL working memory-related activation, replicated in two cohorts and across imaging 
      modalities. These convergent results provide further impetus for examinations of the 
      relationship of SLC12A5 with brain structure and function in neuropsychiatric 
      disease.

TI  - fMRI delineation of working memory for emotional prosody in the brain: commonalities 
      with the lexico-semantic emotion network.
PG  - 1015-25
AB  - Decoding emotional prosody is crucial for successful social interactions, and 
      continuous monitoring of emotional intent via prosody requires working memory. It 
      has been proposed by Ross and others that emotional prosody cognitions in the right 
      hemisphere are organized in an analogous fashion to propositional language functions 
      in the left hemisphere. This study aimed to test the applicability of this model in 
      the context of prefrontal cortex working memory functions. BOLD response data were 
      therefore collected during performance of two emotional working memory tasks by 
      participants undergoing fMRI. In the prosody task, participants identified the 
      emotion conveyed in pre-recorded sentences, and working memory load was manipulated 
      in the style of an N-back task. In the matched lexico-semantic task, participants 
      identified the emotion conveyed by sentence content. Block-design neuroimaging data 
      were analyzed parametrically with SPM5. At first, working memory for emotional 
      prosody appeared to be right-lateralized in the PFC, however, further analyses 
      revealed that it shared much bilateral prefrontal functional neuroanatomy with 
      working memory for lexico-semantic emotion. Supplementary separate analyses of males 
      and females suggested that these language functions were less bilateral in females, 
      but their inclusion did not alter the direction of laterality. It is concluded that 
      Ross et al.'s model is not applicable to prefrontal cortex working memory functions, 
      that evidence that working memory cannot be subdivided in prefrontal cortex 
      according to material type is increased, and that incidental working memory demands 
      may explain the frontal lobe involvement in emotional prosody comprehension as 
      revealed by neuroimaging studies.

      Associated with Subtle Cognitive Deficits in Elderly Controls.
PG  - 127-138
LID - 10.1159/000486152 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive functions progressively deteriorate during aging and 
      neurodegenerative diseases. The present study aims at investigating differences in 
      working memory performance as well as functional brain changes during the earliest 
      stages of cognitive decline in health elderly individuals. METHODS: 62 elderly 
      individuals (41 females), including 41 controls (35 females) and 21 middle cognitive 
      impairment subjects (6 females), underwent neuropsychological assessment at baseline 
      and an fMRI examination in a N-back paradigm contrasting 2-back vs. 0-back 
      condition. Upon a 18 months follow-up, we identified stable controls (sCON) with 
      preserved cognition and deteriorating controls (dCON) with -1SD decrease of 
      performances in at least two neuropsychological tests. Data analyses included 
      accuracy and reaction time (RT) for the 2-back condition and general linear model 
      (GLM) for the fMRI sequence. RESULTS: At the behavioral level, sCON and dCON 
      performed better than MCI in terms of accuracy and reaction time. At the brain 
      level, functional differences in regions of the fronto-parietal network (FPN) and of 
      the Default Mode Network (DFM) were observed. Significantly lower neural activations 
      in the bilateral inferior and middle frontal gyri were found in MCI versus both dCON 
      / sCON and for dCON versus sCON. Significantly increased activations in the anterior 
      cingulate cortex and posterior cingulate cortex and bilateral insula were found in 
      MCI versus both dCON / sCON and in dCON versus sCON. CONCLUSION: The present study 
      suggests that brain functional changes in FPN and DMN anticipate differences in 
      cognitive performance in healthy elderly individuals with subsequent subtle 
      cognitive decline.

AB  - Patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) show preserved or mildly 
      impaired working memory, despite their deficits in episodic memory. We aimed to 
      identify performance and/or neural differences between aMCI patients and matched 
      controls on a standard working memory fMRI task. Neuropsychological assessment 
      demonstrated aMCI impairments in verbal and visual episodic long-term memory, with 
      intact IQ and executive function. Participants completed a standard three-level 
      N-back task where patients were unimpaired. Functional activations in the control 
      group were found in expected areas, including the inferior parietal lobule and 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Group differences were found in the insula and 
      lingual gyrus and, in a region of interest analysis, in the hippocampus. In all 
      cases, these were caused by an absence of task-related deactivations in the aMCI 
      group. The results are consistent with reports of failure in task-related 
      deacivations in aMCI and could be early indications of pathology.

TI  - Effects of methylphenidate on working memory functioning in children with attention 
      deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 516-23
LID - 10.1016/j.ejpn.2008.10.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 
      often show deficits in working memory performance. Methylphenidate (MPH) is an 
      effective medication to improve these cognitive difficulties. This study aimed to 
      clarify which effect MPH induces on the underlying functional networks of working 
      memory. METHODS: Fourteen boys diagnosed with ADHD and 12 healthy controls were 
      investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Each patient was 
      tested twice, once with medication and once without. The fMRI experiments consisted 
      of three verbal N-back tasks with increasing difficulty. Functional images were 
      acquired on a 3 Tesla head scanner. RESULTS: On the behavioral level, medicated 
      patients performed similar to healthy controls and significantly better than without 
      medication. On the functional level, patients showed the expected frontal and 
      parietal activations, which were more pronounced in the 2- and 3-back tasks. Healthy 
      controls showed significantly more activation in these regions and additional 
      activation in the cerebellum. Interestingly, patients showed an additional effect of 
      laterality. Left-sided frontal and parietal activation in patients was significantly 
      less pronounced than in controls. CONCLUSION: Functional data indicate different 
      activation patterns in verbal working memory tasks between healthy controls and 
      patients with ADHD irrespective of medication condition. Intake of MPH led to a 
      clear improvement on a behavioral level. However, this effect was not reflected by 
      changes in functional brain organization. MPH-induced changes leading to better 
      performance in verbal working memory tasks might be very subtle and therefore not 
      detectable by fMRI.

LID - 2
AB  - Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating condition estimated to impact at 
      least 1 million individuals in the United States, however there persists controversy 
      about its existence. Machine learning algorithms have become a powerful methodology 
      for evaluating multi-regional areas of fMRI activation that can classify disease 
      phenotype from sedentary control. Uncovering objective biomarkers such as an fMRI 
      pattern is important for lending credibility to diagnosis of CFS. fMRI scans were 
      evaluated for 69 patients (38 CFS and 31 Control) taken before (Day 1) and after 
      (Day 2) a submaximal exercise test while undergoing the n-back memory paradigm. A 
      predictive model was created by grouping fMRI voxels into the Automated Anatomical 
      Labeling (AAL) atlas, splitting the data into a training and testing dataset, and 
      feeding these inputs into a logistic regression to evaluate differences between CFS 
      and control. Model results were cross-validated 10 times to ensure accuracy. Model 
      results were able to differentiate CFS from sedentary controls at a 80% accuracy on 
      Day 1 and 76% accuracy on Day 2 (Table 3). Recursive features selection identified 
      29 ROI's that significantly distinguished CFS from control on Day 1 and 28 ROI's on 
      Day 2 with 10 regions of overlap shared with Day 1 (Figure 3). These 10 shared 
      regions included the putamen, inferior frontal gyrus, orbital (F3O), supramarginal 
      gyrus (SMG), temporal pole; superior temporal gyrus (T1P) and caudate ROIs. This 
      study was able to uncover a pattern of activated neurological regions that 
      differentiated CFS from Control. This pattern provides a first step toward 
      developing fMRI as a diagnostic biomarker and suggests this methodology could be 
      emulated for other disorders. We concluded that a logistic regression model 
      performed on fMRI data significantly differentiated CFS from Control.

TI  - Impact of phenylalanine on cognitive, cerebral, and neurometabolic parameters in 
      adult patients with phenylketonuria (the PICO study): a randomized, 
      placebo-controlled, crossover, noninferiority trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The population of adult patients with early-treated phenylketonuria 
      (PKU) following newborn screening is growing substantially. The ideal target range 
      of blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in adults outside pregnancy is a matter of 
      debate. Therefore, prospective intervention studies are needed to evaluate the 
      effects of an elevated Phe concentration on cognition and structural, functional, 
      and neurometabolic parameters of the brain. METHODS: The PICO (Phenylalanine and Its 
      Impact on Cognition) Study evaluates the effect of a 4-week Phe load on cognition 
      and cerebral parameters in adults with early-treated PKU in a double-blind, 
      randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover, noninferiority trial. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Thirty adult patients with early-treated PKU and 30 healthy controls comparable to 
      patients with regard to age, sex, and educational level will be recruited from the 
      University Hospitals Bern and Zurich, Switzerland. Patients are eligible for the 
      study if they are 18 years of age or older and had PKU diagnosed after a positive 
      newborn screening and were treated with a Phe-restricted diet starting within the 
      first 30 days of life. INTERVENTION: The cross-over intervention consists of 4-week 
      oral Phe or placebo administration in patients with PKU. The study design mimics a 
      Phe-restricted and a Phe-unrestricted diet using a double-blinded, 
      placebo-controlled approach. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the PICO Study is 
      to prospectively assess whether a temporarily elevated Phe level influences 
      cognitive performance (working memory assessed with a n-back task) in adults with 
      early-treated PKU. As a secondary objective, the PICO Study will elucidate the 
      cerebral (fMRI, neural activation during a n-back task; rsfMRI, functional 
      connectivity at rest; DTI, white matter integrity; and ASL, cerebral blood flow) and 
      neurometabolic mechanisms (cerebral Phe level) that accompany changes in Phe 
      concentration. Cognition, and structural and functional parameters of the brain of 
      adult patients with early-treated PKU will be cross-sectionally compared to healthy 
      controls. All assessments will take place at the University Hospital Bern, 
      Switzerland. RANDOMIZATION: Central randomization will be used to assign 
      participants to the different treatment arms with age, sex, and center serving as 
      the stratification factors. Randomization lists will be generated by an independent 
      statistician. Blinding: All trial personnel other than the statistician generating 
      the randomization list and the personnel at the facility preparing the 
      interventional product are blinded to the assigned treatment. DISCUSSION: Using a 
      combination of neuropsychological and neuroimaging data, the PICO Study will 
      considerably contribute to improve the currently insufficient level of evidence on 
      how adult patients with early-treated PKU should be managed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The 
      study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03788343) on the 27th of 
      December 2018, at kofam.ch (SNCTP000003117) on the 17th of December 2018, and on the 
      International Clinical Trials Registry Platform of the WHO.

AB  - Working memory (WM) is a resource-limited memory system for temporary storage and 
      processing of brain information during the execution of cognitive tasks. Increased 
      WM load will increase the amount and difficulty of memory information. Several 
      studies have used electroencephalography (EEG) or functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) to explore load-dependent cognition processing according to the time 
      courses of electrophysiological activity or the spatial pattern of blood oxygen 
      metabolic activity. However, the relationships between these two activities and the 
      underlying neural mechanism are still unclear. In this study, using simultaneously 
      collected EEG and fMRI data under an n-back verbal WM task, we modeled the spectral 
      perturbation of EEG oscillation and fMRI activation through joint independent 
      component analysis (JICA). Multi-channel oscillation features were also introduced 
      into the JICA model for further analysis. The results showed that time-locked 
      activity of theta and beta were modulated by memory load in the early stimuli 
      evaluation stage, corresponding to the enhanced activation in the frontal and 
      parietal lobe, which were involved in stimulus discrimination, information encoding 
      and delay-period activity. In the late response selection stage, alpha and gamma 
      activity changes dependent on the load correspond to enhanced activation in the 
      areas of frontal, temporal and parietal lobes, which played important roles in 
      attention, information extraction and memory retention. These findings suggest that 
      the increases in memory load not only affect the intensity and time course of the 
      EEG activities, but also lead to the enhanced activation of brain regions which 
      plays different roles during different time periods of cognitive process of WM.

TI  - fMRI abnormalities in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during a working memory task in 
      manic, euthymic and depressed bipolar subjects.
PG  - 22-9
LID - 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2009.11.010 [doi]
AB  - Neuropsychological studies of subjects with bipolar disorder suggest impairment of 
      working memory not only in acute mood states, but also while subjects are euthymic. 
      Using fMRI to probe working memory regions in bipolar subjects in different mood 
      states, we sought to determine the functional neural basis for these impairments. 
      Typical working memory areas in normal populations include dorsolateral prefrontal 
      cortex (BA9/46) and the posterior parietal cortex (BA40). We evaluated the 
      activation in these regions using an n-back task in 42 bipolar subjects (13 manic, 
      15 euthymic and 14 depressed subjects) and 14 control subjects. While both control 
      and bipolar subjects performed similarly on the task, bipolar subjects in all three 
      mood states showed a significant reduction in activation in right BA9/46 and right 
      BA40. Patients with bipolar disorder exhibit significantly attenuated neural 
      activation in working memory circuits, independent of mood state. The reduction of 
      neural activation may suggest a trait-related deficit. Subjects with bipolar 
      disorder activated other additional frontal and temporal regions, perhaps as a 
      compensatory mechanism, but this remains to be further explored.

TI  - Intact working memory in non-manifesting LRRK2 carriers--an fMRI study.
PG  - 106-12
LID - 10.1111/ejn.13120 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive impairments are prevalent in patients with Parkinson's disease. Mutations 
      in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the most common cause of 
      genetic Parkinsonism. Non-manifesting carriers of the G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 
      gene were found to have lower executive functions as measured by the Stroop task. 
      This exploratory study aimed to assess whether the cognitive impairment in 
      non-manifesting carriers is specific for executive functions or includes other 
      cognitive domains such as working memory. We recruited 77 non-manifesting 
      first-degree relatives of Parkinson's disease patients (38 carriers). A block-design 
      fMRI N-back task, with 0-back, 2-back and 3-back conditions, was used in order to 
      assess working memory. Participants were well matched on the Montreal Cognitive 
      Assessment, University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, Unified 
      Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III, digit span, age, gender and Beck 
      Depression Inventory. The task achieved the overall expected effect in both groups 
      with longer reaction times and lower accuracy rates with increasing task demands. 
      However, no whole-brain or region-of-interest between-groups differences were found 
      on any of the task conditions. These results indicate that non-manifesting carriers 
      of the G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene have a specific cognitive profile with 
      executive functions, as assessed by the Stroop task, demonstrating significant 
      impairment but with working memory, as assessed with the N-back task, remaining 
      relatively intact. These finding shed light on the pre-motor cognitive changes in 
      this unique 'at risk' population and should enable more focused cognitive 
      assessments of these cohorts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive dysfunction in depression and bipolar disorder (BD) is 
      insufficiently targeted by available treatments. Erythropoietin (EPO) increases 
      neuroplasticity and may improve cognition in mood disorders, but the neuronal 
      mechanisms of these effects are unknown. This functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) study investigated the effects of EPO on neural circuitry activity during 
      working memory (WM) performance. METHOD: Patients with treatment-resistant major 
      depression, who were moderately depressed, or with BD in partial remission, were 
      randomized to eight weekly infusions of EPO (40 000 IU) (N = 30) or saline (N = 26) 
      in a double-blind, parallel-group design. Patients underwent fMRI, mood ratings and 
      blood tests at baseline and week 14. During fMRI patients performed an n-back WM 
      task. RESULTS: EPO improved WM accuracy compared with saline (p = 0.045). 
      Whole-brain analyses revealed that EPO increased WM load-related activity in the 
      right superior frontal gyrus (SFG) compared with saline (p = 0.01). There was also 
      enhanced WM load-related deactivation of the left hippocampus in EPO-treated 
      compared to saline-treated patients (p = 0.03). Across the entire sample, baseline 
      to follow-up changes in WM performance correlated positively with changes in 
      WM-related SFG activity and negatively with hippocampal response (r = 0.28-0.30, p < 
      0.05). The effects of EPO were not associated with changes in mood or red blood 
      cells (p ⩾0.08). CONCLUSIONS: The present findings associate changes in WM-load 
      related activity in the right SFG and left hippocampus with improved executive 
      function in EPO-treated patients. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov: 
      NCT00916552.

TI  - Altered DLPFC-Hippocampus Connectivity During Working Memory: Independent 
      Replication and Disorder Specificity of a Putative Genetic Risk Phenotype for 
      Schizophrenia.
PG  - 1114-1122
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbx001 [doi]
AB  - Altered connectivity of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and hippocampus 
      during working memory is considered an intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia 
      (SCZ), but the relevance for other mental disorders with shared genetic background 
      remains unknown. Here we investigated its presence in unaffected first-degree 
      relatives of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). 
      Furthermore, we aimed to provide an independent replication of this phenotype in 
      first-degree relatives of SCZ patients. We acquired functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) data from 309 healthy controls and 218 healthy first-degree relatives 
      of index patients with SCZ (n = 62), BD (n = 66) and MDD (n = 90), who completed the 
      n-back working memory paradigm. We observed a significant group effect on 
      DLPFC-hippocampus coupling (PFWE = .031, all P-values region of interest [ROI] 
      corrected). Post hoc comparisons revealed that this effect was driven by the SCZ 
      relatives, who showed a significant increase in the negative functional connectivity 
      of the DLPFC and right hippocampus compared to controls (PFWE = .001), BD relatives 
      (PFWE = .015) and trend-wise also MDD relatives (PFWE = .082). Comparison of BD and 
      MDD relatives to the controls revealed no difference (PFWE-values > .451). 
      Supplementary analyses suggested that the SCZ relatives finding is robust to a range 
      of potential confounds, including structural differences. Our data further support 
      altered DLPFC-hippocampus connectivity during working memory as an intermediate 
      phenotype for SCZ. This suggests that this phenotype is relatively specific to SCZ 
      and does not translate to other genetically related disorders in the mood-psychosis 
      spectrum.

TI  - Default Mode Dynamics for Global Functional Integration.
PG  - 15254-62
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2135-15.2015 [doi]
AB  - The default mode network (DMN) has been traditionally assumed to hinder behavioral 
      performance in externally focused, goal-directed paradigms and to provide no active 
      contribution to human cognition. However, recent evidence suggests greater DMN 
      activity in an array of tasks, especially those that involve self-referential and 
      memory-based processing. Although data that robustly demonstrate a comprehensive 
      functional role for DMN remains relatively scarce, the global workspace framework, 
      which implicates the DMN in global information integration for conscious processing, 
      can potentially provide an explanation for the broad range of higher-order paradigms 
      that report DMN involvement. We used graph theoretical measures to assess the 
      contribution of the DMN to global functional connectivity dynamics in 22 healthy 
      volunteers during an fMRI-based n-back working-memory paradigm with parametric 
      increases in difficulty. Our predominant finding is that brain modularity decreases 
      with greater task demands, thus adapting a more global workspace configuration, in 
      direct relation to increases in reaction times to correct responses. Flexible 
      default mode regions dynamically switch community memberships and display 
      significant changes in their nodal participation coefficient and strength, which may 
      reflect the observed whole-brain changes in functional connectivity architecture. 
      These findings have important implications for our understanding of healthy brain 
      function, as they suggest a central role for the DMN in higher cognitive processing. 
      SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The default mode network (DMN) has been shown to increase 
      its activity during the absence of external stimulation, and hence was historically 
      assumed to disengage during goal-directed tasks. Recent evidence, however, 
      implicates the DMN in self-referential and memory-based processing. We provide 
      robust evidence for this network's active contribution to working memory by 
      revealing dynamic reconfiguration in its interactions with other networks and offer 
      an explanation within the global workspace theoretical framework. These promising 
      findings may help redefine our understanding of the exact DMN role in human 
      cognition.

TI  - Effect of baseline cannabis use and working-memory network function on changes in 
      cannabis use in heavy cannabis users: a prospective fMRI study.
PG  - 2470-82
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22342 [doi]
AB  - Theoretical models of addiction suggest that a substance use disorder represents an 
      imbalance between hypersensitive motivational processes and deficient regulatory 
      executive functions. Working-memory (a central executive function) may be a powerful 
      predictor of the course of drug use and drug-related problems. Goal of the current 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging study was to assess the predictive power of 
      working-memory network function for future cannabis use and cannabis-related problem 
      severity in heavy cannabis users. Tensor independent component analysis was used to 
      investigate differences in working-memory network function between 32 heavy cannabis 
      users and 41 nonusing controls during an N-back working-memory task. In addition, 
      associations were examined between working-memory network function and cannabis use 
      and problem severity at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. Behavioral performance 
      and working-memory network function did not significantly differ between heavy 
      cannabis users and controls. However, among heavy cannabis users, individual 
      differences in working-memory network response had an independent effect on change 
      in weekly cannabis use 6 months later (ΔR(2) = 0.11, P = 0.006, f(2) = 0.37) beyond 
      baseline cannabis use (ΔR(2) = 0.41) and a behavioral measure of approach bias 
      (ΔR(2) = 0.18): a stronger network response during the N-back task was related to an 
      increase in weekly cannabis use. These findings imply that heavy cannabis users 
      requiring greater effort to accurately complete an N-back working-memory task have a 
      higher probability of escalating cannabis use. Working-memory network function may 
      be a biomarker for the prediction of course and treatment outcome in cannabis users.

TI  - The effects of nicotine and non-nicotine smoking factors on working memory and 
      associated brain function.
PG  - 954-61
LID - 10.1111/adb.12253 [doi]
AB  - Smoking abstinence impairs executive function, which may promote continued smoking 
      behavior and relapse. The differential influence of nicotine and non-nicotine (i.e. 
      sensory, motor) smoking factors and related neural substrates is not known. In a 
      fully factorial, within-subjects design, 33 smokers underwent fMRI scanning 
      following 24 hours of wearing a nicotine or placebo patch while smoking very low 
      nicotine content cigarettes or remaining abstinent from smoking. During scanning, 
      blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal was acquired while participants 
      performed a verbal N-back task. Following 24-hour placebo (versus nicotine) 
      administration, accuracy on the N-back task was significantly worse and task-related 
      BOLD signal lower in dorsomedial frontal cortex. These effects were observed 
      irrespective of smoking. Our data provide novel evidence that abstinence-induced 
      deficits in working memory and changes in underlying brain function are due in large 
      part to abstinence from nicotine compared with non-nicotine factors. This work has 
      implications both for designing interventions that target abstinence-induced 
      cognitive deficits and for nicotine-reduction policy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study investigated the relationship between 
      cardiorespiratory fitness and executive functioning in pediatric brain tumor 
      survivors who received cranial radiation. This population is known to show executive 
      dysfunction and lower rates of aerobic exercise compared to peers. PROCEDURE: Nine 
      adolescent survivors of pediatric posterior fossa tumor completed an n-back working 
      memory task during a functional MRI scan, as well as cardiorespiratory fitness 
      testing on a cycle ergometer. RESULTS: Neuroimaging findings indicated typical 
      activation patterns associated with working memory, mainly in the frontal-parietal 
      network. Higher cardiorespiratory fitness was related to better performance on a 
      behavioral measure of working memory and more efficient neural functioning. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that cardiorespiratory fitness 
      may be related to executive functioning, particularly working memory, in pediatric 
      brain tumor survivors. Descriptions of the brain regions recruited for working 
      memory by pediatric brain tumor survivors may be used to inform future interventions 
      or indicators of treatment efficacy.

TI  - Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Working Memory and Executive Dysfunction in 
      Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Antiphospholipid Antibody-Positive Patients.
PG  - 1655-1663
LID - 10.1002/acr.22873 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Standardized cognitive tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) studies of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients demonstrate deficits 
      in working memory and executive function. These neurobehavioral abnormalities are 
      not well studied in antiphospholipid syndrome, which may occur independently of or 
      together with SLE. This study compares an fMRI paradigm involving motor skills, 
      working memory, and executive function in SLE patients without antiphospholipid 
      antibody (aPL) (the SLE group), aPL-positive non-SLE patients (the aPL-positive 
      group), and controls. METHODS: Brain MRI, fMRI, and standardized cognitive 
      assessment results were obtained from 20 SLE, 20 aPL-positive, and 10 healthy female 
      subjects with no history of neuropsychiatric abnormality. RESULTS: Analysis of fMRI 
      data showed no differences in performance across groups on bilateral motor tasks. 
      When analysis of variance was used, significant group differences were found in 2 
      executive function tasks (word generation and word rhyming) and in a working memory 
      task (N-Back). Patients positive for aPL demonstrated higher activation in bilateral 
      frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices compared to controls during working memory 
      and executive function tasks. SLE patients also demonstrated bilateral frontal and 
      temporal activation during working memory and executive function tasks. CONCLUSION: 
      Compared to controls, both aPL-positive and SLE patients had elevated cortical 
      activation, primarily in the frontal lobes, during tasks involving working memory 
      and executive function. These findings are consistent with cortical overactivation 
      as a compensatory mechanism for early white matter neuropathology in these 
      disorders.

TI  - Association of abstinence-induced alterations in working memory function and COMT 
      genotype in smokers.
PG  - 653-62
LID - 10.1007/s00213-013-3197-3 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: The common methionine (met) for valine (val) at codon 158 (val(158)met) 
      polymorphism in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene has been associated 
      with nicotine dependence, alterations in executive cognitive function, and 
      abstinence-induced working memory deficits in smokers. OBJECTIVES: We sought to 
      replicate the association of the COMT val allele with abstinence-induced alterations 
      in working memory-related activity in task-positive (executive control) and 
      task-negative (default mode network) regions. METHODS: Forty smokers (20 val/val and 
      20 met/met) performed an N-back task while undergoing blood oxygen level-dependent 
      (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on two separate occasions: 
      following 72 h of confirmed abstinence and during smoking as usual. An independent 
      sample of 48 smokers who completed the identical N-back task during fMRI in smoking 
      vs. abstinence for another study was used as a validation sample. RESULTS: Contrary 
      to expectations, genotype by session interactions on BOLD signal in executive 
      control regions (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and dorsal cingulate/medial 
      prefrontal cortex) revealed significant abstinence-induced reductions in the met/met 
      group, but not the val/val group. Results also revealed that val/val smokers may 
      exhibit less suppression of activation in task-negative regions such as the 
      posterior cingulate cortex during abstinence (vs. smoking). These patterns were 
      confirmed in the validation sample and in the whole-brain analysis, though the 
      regions differed from the a priori regions of interest (ROIs) (e.g., precuneus, 
      insula). CONCLUSIONS: The COMT val(158)met polymorphism was associated with 
      abstinence-related working memory deficits in two independent samples of smokers. 
      However, inconsistencies compared to prior findings and across methods (ROI vs. 
      whole-brain analysis) highlight the challenges inherent in reproducing results of 
      imaging genetic studies in addiction.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0095997 [doi]
LID - e95997
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prefrontal behavior and activity in humans are heritable. Studies in 
      animals demonstrate an interaction between dopamine D2 receptors and nicotinic 
      acetylcholine receptors on prefrontal behavior but evidence in humans is weak. 
      Therefore, we hypothesize that genetic variation regulating dopamine D2 and 
      nicotinic acetylcholine receptor signaling impact prefrontal cortex activity and 
      related cognition. To test this hypothesis in humans, we explored the interaction 
      between functional genetic variants in the D2 receptor gene (DRD2, rs1076560) and in 
      the nicotinic receptor α5 gene (CHRNA5, rs16969968) on both dorsolateral prefrontal 
      cortex mediated behavior and physiology during working memory and on prefrontal gray 
      matter volume. METHODS: A large sample of healthy subjects was compared for 
      genotypic differences for DRD2 rs1076560 (G>T) and CHNRA5 rs16969968 (G>A) on 
      prefrontal phenotypes, including cognitive performance at the N-Back task, 
      prefrontal physiology with BOLD fMRI during performance of the 2-Back working memory 
      task, and prefrontal morphometry with structural MRI. RESULTS: We found that DRD2 
      rs1076560 and CHNRA5 rs16969968 interact to modulate cognitive function, prefrontal 
      physiology during working memory, and prefrontal gray matter volume. More 
      specifically, CHRNA5-AA/DRD2-GT subjects had greater behavioral performance, more 
      efficient prefrontal cortex activity at 2Back working memory task, and greater 
      prefrontal gray matter volume than the other genotype groups. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      present data extend previous studies in animals and enhance our understanding of 
      dopamine and acetylcholine signaling in the human prefrontal cortex, demonstrating 
      interactions elicited by working memory that are modulated by genetic variants in 
      DRD2 and CHRNA5.

TI  - Brain activation patterns associated with working memory in relapsing-remitting MS.
PG  - 234-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) show changes in brain activation 
      patterns during visual and motor tasks that include decreases in the typical local 
      network for a function and increases in other brain regions. OBJECTIVE: To determine 
      whether brain activation patterns associated with working memory are affected by MS. 
      METHODS: Activation of working memory circuitry was examined using an fMRI n-back 
      task in adults with mild relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS; n = 10) and demographically 
      matched healthy controls (n = 10). RESULTS: Group differences in brain activation 
      emerged during both low- and high-demand conditions (p < 0.001). Overall, patients 
      showed less activation than controls in core prefrontal and parietal regions of 
      working memory circuitry, and greater activation in other regions within and beyond 
      typical working memory circuitry, including bilateral medial frontal, cingulate, 
      parietal, bilateral middle temporal, and occipital regions. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to 
      controls, patients with mild RRMS showed shifts in brain activation patterns within 
      and beyond typical components of working memory circuitry.

TI  - Toward a "treadmill test" for cognition: Improved prediction of general cognitive 
      ability from the task activated brain.
PG  - 3186-3197
LID - 10.1002/hbm.25007 [doi]
AB  - General cognitive ability (GCA) refers to a trait-like ability that contributes to 
      performance across diverse cognitive tasks. Identifying brain-based markers of GCA 
      has been a longstanding goal of cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Recently, 
      predictive modeling methods have emerged that build whole-brain, distributed neural 
      signatures for phenotypes of interest. In this study, we employ a predictive 
      modeling approach to predict GCA based on fMRI task activation patterns during the 
      N-back working memory task as well as six other tasks in the Human Connectome 
      Project dataset (n = 967), encompassing 15 task contrasts in total. We found tasks 
      are a highly effective basis for prediction of GCA: The 2-back versus 0-back 
      contrast achieved a 0.50 correlation with GCA scores in 10-fold cross-validation, 
      and 13 out of 15 task contrasts afforded statistically significant prediction of 
      GCA. Additionally, we found that task contrasts that produce greater frontoparietal 
      activation and default mode network deactivation-a brain activation pattern 
      associated with executive processing and higher cognitive demand-are more effective 
      in the prediction of GCA. These results suggest a picture analogous to treadmill 
      testing for cardiac function: Placing the brain in a more cognitively demanding task 
      state significantly improves brain-based prediction of GCA.

AB  - Although key to understanding individual variation in task-related brain activation, 
      the genetic contribution to these individual differences remains largely unknown. 
      Here we report voxel-by-voxel genetic model fitting in a large sample of 319 
      healthy, young adult, human identical and fraternal twins (mean ± SD age, 23.6 ± 1.8 
      years) who performed an n-back working memory task during functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) at a high magnetic field (4 tesla). Patterns of 
      task-related brain response (BOLD signal difference of 2-back minus 0-back) were 
      significantly heritable, with the highest estimates (40-65%) in the inferior, 
      middle, and superior frontal gyri, left supplementary motor area, precentral and 
      postcentral gyri, middle cingulate cortex, superior medial gyrus, angular gyrus, 
      superior parietal lobule, including precuneus, and superior occipital gyri. 
      Furthermore, high test-retest reliability for a subsample of 40 twins indicates that 
      nongenetic variance in the fMRI brain response is largely due to unique 
      environmental influences rather than measurement error. Individual variations in 
      activation of the working memory network are therefore significantly influenced by 
      genetic factors. By establishing the heritability of cognitive brain function in a 
      large sample that affords good statistical power, and using voxel-by-voxel analyses, 
      this study provides the necessary evidence for task-related brain activation to be 
      considered as an endophenotype for psychiatric or neurological disorders, and 
      represents a substantial new contribution to the field of neuroimaging genetics. 
      These genetic brain maps should facilitate discovery of gene variants influencing 
      cognitive brain function through genome-wide association studies, potentially 
      opening up new avenues in the treatment of brain disorders.

AB  - The difference between the speed of simple cognitive processes and the speed of 
      complex cognitive processes has various psychological correlates. However, the 
      neural correlates of this difference have not yet been investigated. In this study, 
      we focused on working memory (WM) for typical complex cognitive processes. 
      Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired during the performance of 
      an N-back task, which is a measure of WM for typical complex cognitive processes. In 
      our N-back task, task speed and memory load were varied to identify the neural 
      correlates responsible for the difference between the speed of simple cognitive 
      processes (estimated from the 0-back task) and the speed of WM. Our findings showed 
      that this difference was characterized by the increased activation in the right 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the increased functional interaction 
      between the right DLPFC and right superior parietal lobe. Furthermore, the local 
      gray matter volume of the right DLPFC was correlated with participants' accuracy 
      during fast WM tasks, which in turn correlated with a psychometric measure of 
      participants' intelligence. Our findings indicate that the right DLPFC and its 
      related network are responsible for the execution of the fast cognitive processes 
      involved in WM. Identified neural bases may underlie the psychometric differences 
      between the speed with which subjects perform simple cognitive tasks and the speed 
      with which subjects perform more complex cognitive tasks, and explain the previous 
      traditional psychological findings.

AB  - Recent evidence indicates that the relationship between increased beta-amyloid (Aβ) 
      deposition and functional task-activation can be characterized by a non-linear 
      trajectory of change in functional activation (Foster et al., 2017), explaining 
      mixed results in prior literature showing both increases and decreases in activation 
      as a function of beta-amyloid burden in cognitively normal adults. Here we sought to 
      replicate this nonlinear effect in the same sample using a different functional 
      paradigm to test the generalizability of this phenomenon. Participants (N = 68 
      healthy adults aged 49-94) underwent fMRI (0-, 2-, 3-, 4-back working memory task; 
      WM) and (18)F-Florbetapir PET scanning. A parametric WM load contrast was used as 
      the dependent variable in a model with age, mean cortical Aβ, and Aβ(2) as 
      predictors. Results revealed that nonlinear amyloid (Aβ(2)) was a significant 
      negative predictor of modulation of activation to WM load in two large inferior 
      clusters: bilateral subcortical nuclei and bilateral lateral cerebellum. Individuals 
      with slightly elevated Aβ burden evidenced greater modulation as compared to 
      individuals with little or no Aβ burden, whereas individuals with the greatest Aβ 
      burden evidenced lesser modulation as compared to individuals with slightly elevated 
      Aβ. Increased modulation to WM load predicted better task accuracy and executive 
      function measured outside the scanner. The current study provides further evidence 
      for a dose-response, nonlinear relationship between increasing Aβ burden and 
      alteration in brain activation in cognitively healthy adults, extending the existing 
      evidence to dynamic range of activation to task difficulty, and reconciling 
      seemingly discrepant effects of amyloid on brain function.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: APOE4 is the best-documented genetic risk factor for 
      sporadic AD. Previous research showed that APOE4 is associated with increased risk 
      of occurrence and earlier onset of AD in a gene dose-dependent manner. However, the 
      specific role of APOE4 in processing of brain functions requires further 
      investigation. Investigators have used fMRI to measure brain activity on the basis 
      of the blood oxygen level-dependent contrast. This study investigates the effects of 
      APOE4 on fMRI during n-back WM tasks in healthy middle-aged adults. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: From 110 participants, 81 individuals without objective or subjective 
      cognitive impairment underwent APOE genotyping. Nine APOE4 carriers and 9 age- and 
      sex-matched non-APOE4 controls were recruited for fMRI examinations during WM tasks. 
      RESULTS: Both groups displayed increased brain activation in response to increases 
      in WM loads. During low-WM-load tasks, the APOE4 carriers recruited significantly 
      greater additional processing resources than the non-APOE4 carriers. During 
      moderate- and high-WM-load tasks, the APOE4 carrier group displayed fewer increases 
      in activation than the non-APOE4 carrier group. CONCLUSIONS: APOE genetic 
      polymorphisms may affect brain functioning in subjects without dementia. The 
      patterns of brain activation during different levels of WM load suggest possible 
      subclinical impairment of WM capacity in APOE4 carriers (ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - Task positive and default mode networks during a parametric working memory task in 
      obstructive sleep apnea patients and healthy controls.
PG  - 293-301A
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies enable the 
      investigation of neural correlates underlying behavioral performance. We investigate 
      the working memory (WM) function of patients with untreated obstructive sleep apnea 
      (OSA) from the view point of task positive and default mode networks (TPN and DMN, 
      respectively) and compare the results to those of healthy controls (HC). METHODS: A 
      parametric fMRI experiment with 4 levels of visuospatial N-back task was used to 
      investigate the pattern of cortical activation in 17 men with untreated moderate or 
      severe OSA and 7 age-matched HC. Categorical and parametrical analysis of the data 
      was performed. Multiple regression analysis of fMRI data of OSA patients was 
      performed with AHI, nocturnal desaturation time, and BMI as covariates. RESULTS: OSA 
      patients demonstrate compensatory spatial recruitment of the TPN (maximal at 3-back) 
      and of the DMN (maximal at 2-back). HC had a different patten of spatial recruitment 
      and deactivation of the DMN at the maximal load of task (3-back). Nocturnal 
      desaturation had significant positive correlation with BOLD signal in bilateral 
      frontal, temporal, and occipital regions, and negative correlations in bilateral 
      frontal and left parietal regions; whereas BMI showed only negative correlations 
      with BOLD signal, predominantly in the PFC. AHI was positively correlated with BOLD 
      signal in bilateral frontal regions. CONCLUSION: Both TPN and DMN are affected in 
      OSA patients, with nocturnal desaturation affecting both networks; whereas BMI 
      appears to be the major negative factor influencing the TPN and has a significant 
      negative correlation with behavioral performance.

AB  - The present study utilized functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to detect 
      neural activation differences in the orbitofrontal brain region between individuals 
      with multiple sclerosis (MS) and healthy controls (HCs) during a working memory (WM) 
      task. Thirteen individuals with MS and 12 HCs underwent fNIRS recording while 
      performing the n-back WM task with four levels of difficulty (0-, 1-, 2-, and 
      3-back). Subjects were fitted with the fNIRS cap consisting of 30 'optodes' 
      positioned over the forehead. The results revealed different patterns of brain 
      activation in MS and HCs. The MS group showed an increase in brain activation, as 
      measured by the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyHb), in the left superior 
      frontal gyrus (LSFG) at lower task difficulty levels (i.e. 1-back), followed by a 
      decrease at higher task difficulty (2- and 3-back) as compared with the HC group. HC 
      group achieved higher accuracy than the MS group on the lower task loads (i.e. 0- 
      and 1-back), however there were no performance differences between the groups at the 
      higher task loads (i.e. 2- and 3-back). Taken together, the results suggest that 
      individuals with MS experience a task with the lower cognitive load as more 
      difficult than the HC group, and the brain activation patterns observed during the 
      task confirm some of the previous findings from functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) studies. This study is the first to investigate brain activation by 
      utilizing the method of fNIRS in MS during the performance of a cognitive task.

TI  - Increased memory load-related frontal activation after estradiol treatment in 
      postmenopausal women.
PG  - 929-35
LID - 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2010.09.003 [doi]
AB  - Prior research shows that menopause is associated with changes in cognition in some 
      older women. However, how estrogen loss and subsequent estrogen treatment affects 
      cognition and particularly the underlying brain processes responsible for any 
      cognitive changes is less well understood. We examined the ability of estradiol to 
      modulate the manipulation of information in working memory and related brain 
      activation in postmenopausal women. Twenty healthy postmenopausal women (mean age 
      (SD)=59.13 (5.5)) were randomly assigned to three months of 1mg oral 17-β estradiol 
      or placebo. At baseline and three months later each woman completed a visual verbal 
      N-back sequential letter test of working memory during functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI). The fMRI data showed that women who were treated with estradiol for 
      three months had increased frontal activation during the more difficult working 
      memory load conditions compared to women treated with placebo. Performance on the 
      verbal working memory task showed no difference between estradiol and placebo 
      treated subjects. These data are consistent with prior work showing increases in 
      frontal activation on memory tasks after estrogen treatment. However, this is the 
      first study to show that estrogen-induced increases in brain activity were tied to 
      cognitive load during a verbal working memory task. These data suggest that 
      estradiol treatment effects on cognition may be in part produced through modulation 
      of frontal lobe functioning under difficult task conditions.

AB  - This study examined the reproducibility of prefrontal-hippocampal connectivity 
      estimates obtained by stochastic dynamic causal modeling (sDCM). 180 healthy 
      subjects were measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a 
      standard working memory N-Back task at three different sites (Mannheim, Bonn, 
      Berlin; each with 60 participants). The reproducibility of regional activations in 
      key regions for working memory (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC; hippocampal 
      formation, HF) was evaluated using conjunction analyses across locations. These 
      analyses showed consistent activation of right DLPFC and deactivation of left HF 
      across all three different sites. The effective connectivity between DLPFC and HF 
      was analyzed using a simple two-region sDCM. For each subject, we evaluated 
      sixty-seven alternative sDCMs and compared their relative plausibility using 
      Bayesian model selection (BMS). Across all locations, BMS consistently revealed the 
      same winning model, with the 2-Back working memory condition as driving input to 
      both DLPFC and HF and with a connection from DLPFC to HF. Statistical tests on the 
      sDCM parameter estimates did not show any significant differences across the three 
      sites. The consistency of both the BMS results and model parameter estimates 
      indicates the reliability of sDCM in our paradigm. This provides a basis for future 
      genetic and clinical studies using this approach.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine functional and structural neuroimaging correlates of 
      cognitive dysfunction associated with cannabis use in multiple sclerosis (MS). 
      METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 20 subjects with MS who smoked cannabis and 19 
      noncannabis users with MS, matched on demographic and neurologic variables, 
      underwent fMRI while completing a test of working memory, the N-Back. Resting-state 
      fMRI and structural MRI data (lesion and normal-appearing brain tissue volumes, 
      diffusion tensor imaging metrics) were also collected. Neuropsychological data 
      pertaining to verbal (Selective Reminding Test Revised) and visual (10/36 Spatial 
      Recall Test) memory, information processing speed (Paced Auditory Serial Addition 
      Test [2- and 3-second versions] and Symbol Digit Modalities Test), and attention 
      (Word List Generation) were obtained. RESULTS: The cannabis group performed more 
      poorly on the more demanding of the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test tasks (i.e., 
      2-second version) (p < 0.02) and the 10/36 Spatial Recall Test (p < 0.03). Cannabis 
      users had more diffuse cerebral activation across all N-Back trials and made more 
      errors on the 2-Back task (p < 0.006), during which they displayed increased 
      activation relative to nonusers in parietal (p < 0.007) and anterior cingulate (p < 
      0.001) regions implicated in working memory. No group differences in resting-state 
      networks or structural MRI variables were found. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MS who 
      smoke cannabis are more cognitively impaired than nonusers. Cannabis further 
      compromises cerebral compensatory mechanisms, already faulty in MS. These imaging 
      data boost the construct validity of the neuropsychological findings and act as a 
      cautionary note to cannabis users and prescribers.

AB  - As indicated by previous research, aging is associated with a decline in working 
      memory (WM) functioning, related to alterations in fronto-parietal neural 
      activations. At the same time, previous studies showed that WM training in older 
      adults may improve the performance in the trained task (training effect), and more 
      importantly, also in untrained WM tasks (transfer effects). However, neural 
      correlates of these transfer effects that would improve understanding of its 
      underlying mechanisms, have not been shown in older participants as yet. In this 
      study, we investigated blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes during 
      n-back performance and an untrained delayed recognition (Sternberg) task following 
      12sessions (45min each) of adaptive n-back training in older adults. The Sternberg 
      task used in this study allowed to test for neural training effects independent of 
      specific task affordances of the trained task and to separate maintenance from 
      updating processes. Thirty-two healthy older participants (60-75years) were assigned 
      either to an n-back training or a no-contact control group. Before (t1) and after 
      (t2) training/waiting period, both the n-back task and the Sternberg task were 
      conducted while BOLD signal was measured using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
      (fMRI) in all participants. In addition, neuropsychological tests were performed 
      outside the scanner. WM performance improved with training and behavioral transfer 
      to tests measuring executive functions, processing speed, and fluid intelligence was 
      found. In the training group, BOLD signal in the right lateral middle frontal 
      gyrus/caudal superior frontal sulcus (Brodmann area, BA 6/8) decreased in both the 
      trained n-back and the updating condition of the untrained Sternberg task at t2, 
      compared to the control group. fMRI findings indicate a training-related increase in 
      processing efficiency of WM networks, potentially related to the process of WM 
      updating. Performance gains in untrained tasks suggest that transfer to other 
      cognitive tasks remains possible in aging.

      rTMS and fMRI.

AB  - Neuronal plasticity is crucial for flexible interaction with a changing environment 
      and its disruption is thought to contribute to psychiatric diseases like 
      schizophrenia. High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is 
      a noninvasive tool to increase local excitability of neurons and induce short-time 
      functional reorganization of cortical networks. While this has been shown for the 
      motor system, little is known about the short-term plasticity of networks for 
      executive cognition in humans. We examined 12 healthy control subjects in a 
      crossover study with fMRI after real and sham 5 Hz rTMS to the right dorsolateral 
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). During scanning, subjects performed an n-back working 
      memory (WM) task and a flanker task engaging cognitive control. Reaction times 
      during the n-back task were significantly shorter after rTMS than after sham 
      stimulation. RTMS compared with sham stimulation caused no activation changes at the 
      stimulation site (right DLPFC) itself, but significantly increased connectivity 
      within the WM network during n-back and reduced activation in the anterior cingulate 
      cortex during the flanker task. Reduced reaction times after real stimulation 
      support an excitatory effect of high-frequency rTMS. Our findings identified plastic 
      changes in prefrontally connected networks downstream of the stimulation site as the 
      substrate of this behavioral effect. Using a multimodal fMRI-rTMS approach, we could 
      demonstrate changes in cortical plasticity in humans during executive cognition. In 
      further studies this approach could be used to study pharmacological, genetic and 
      disease-related alterations.

TI  - Neural correlates of emotional working memory in patients with mild cognitive 
      impairment.
PG  - 37-48
AB  - Emotional stimuli can have beneficial effects on memory in healthy aged subjects and 
      partly on patients with dementia. So far, no experimental study has explored the 
      effects of memory for emotional stimuli in patients with mild cognitive impairment 
      (MCI), a concept that describes a transitional state between normal aging and 
      dementia. The present fMRI study explored working memory for emotional stimuli in 16 
      patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) and 16 healthy aged participants. Subjects 
      performed an n-back task (2-back) with neutral, positive, and negative emotional 
      pictures. The analysis focused on target processing. Results showed that groups did 
      not differ in working memory performance. In healthy aged participants emotional 
      targets had no significant impact on working memory. In patients with aMCI a 
      negativity bias was observed, indicating that negative targets were better 
      remembered compared to neutral and positive targets. Regarding fMRI results, both 
      groups showed an increase in functional activity in prefrontal and lateral parietal 
      brain regions associated with target processing. As a key result, we observed 
      significant group by emotion interaction effects in the precuneus. Healthy aged 
      participants showed a signal decrease in the left precuneus for positive compared to 
      neutral targets. The precuneus deactivation in healthy aged participants may 
      indicate a disengagement of self-referential processes towards task-related 
      processes. Patients with aMCI revealed a signal increase in the right precuneus for 
      negative compared to neutral targets. This increase in precuneus activity, combined 
      with a behavioural facilitation effect, may indicate a mechanism to compensate 
      disease related processes in aMCI.

AB  - Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated the effects of 
      context features on the involvement of the working memory (WM) system during 
      discourse comprehension. During the fMRI scan, participants were asked to read 
      two-sentence discourses in which the topic of the second sentence was either 
      maintained, or was shifted from, the topic of the first. Changes in the level of 
      coherence between the two sentences as well as context length were also investigated 
      across discourse items. The WM system was identified with a verbal N-back task. 
      Analysis of the reading comprehension task revealed that within the WM system, 
      stronger activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus corresponded with increased 
      bridging coherence demands between sentences, while greater activation in the left 
      inferior and middle frontal gyri, bilateral superior frontal gyri, and bilateral 
      inferior parietal lobules corresponded with increased context length. Topic 
      variation showed no effect on activation of the WM system. These results provide new 
      insights into understanding how different levels of context features modulate 
      activation of the subcomponents of the WM system and indicate a role for the left 
      inferior frontal gyrus as a core component of the WM system supporting discourse 
      processing.

TI  - Pattern Similarity Analyses of FrontoParietal Task Coding: Individual Variation and 
      Genetic Influences.
PG  - 3167-3183
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhz301 [doi]
AB  - Pattern similarity analyses are increasingly used to characterize coding properties 
      of brain regions, but relatively few have focused on cognitive control processes in 
      FrontoParietal regions. Here, we use the Human Connectome Project (HCP) N-back task 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset to examine individual 
      differences and genetic influences on the coding of working memory load (0-back, 
      2-back) and perceptual category (Face, Place). Participants were grouped into 105 
      monozygotic twin, 78 dizygotic twin, 99 nontwin sibling, and 100 unrelated pairs. 
      Activation pattern similarity was used to test the hypothesis that FrontoParietal 
      regions would have higher similarity for same load conditions, while Visual regions 
      would have higher similarity in same perceptual category conditions. Results 
      confirmed this highly robust regional double dissociation in neural coding, which 
      also predicted individual differences in behavioral performance. In pair-based 
      analyses, anatomically selective genetic relatedness effects were observed: 
      relatedness predicted greater activation pattern similarity in FrontoParietal only 
      for load coding and in Visual only for perceptual coding. Further, in related pairs, 
      the similarity of load coding in FrontoParietal regions was uniquely associated with 
      behavioral performance. Together, these results highlight the power of task fMRI 
      pattern similarity analyses for detecting key coding and heritability features of 
      brain regions.

TI  - Angular default mode network connectivity across working memory load.
PG  - 41-52
LID - 10.1002/hbm.23341 [doi]
AB  - Initially identified during no-task, baseline conditions, it has now been suggested 
      that the default mode network (DMN) engages during a variety of working memory 
      paradigms through its flexible interactions with other large-scale brain networks. 
      Nevertheless, its contribution to whole-brain connectivity dynamics across 
      increasing working memory load has not been explicitly assessed. The aim of our 
      study was to determine which DMN hubs relate to working memory task performance 
      during an fMRI-based n-back paradigm with parametric increases in difficulty. Using 
      a voxel-wise metric, termed the intrinsic connectivity contrast (ICC), we found that 
      the bilateral angular gyri (core DMN hubs) displayed the greatest change in global 
      connectivity across three levels of n-back task load. Subsequent seed-based 
      functional connectivity analysis revealed that the angular DMN regions robustly 
      interact with other large-scale brain networks, suggesting a potential involvement 
      in the global integration of information. Further support for this hypothesis comes 
      from the significant correlations we found between angular gyri connectivity and 
      reaction times to correct responses. The implication from our study is that the DMN 
      is actively involved during the n-back task and thus plays an important role related 
      to working memory, with its core angular regions contributing to the changes in 
      global brain connectivity in response to increasing environmental demands. Hum Brain

TI  - Working memory of identification of emotional vocal expressions: an fMRI study.
PG  - 1090-101
AB  - The distribution of brain activation during working memory processing of emotional 
      vocal expressions was studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 
      eight female subjects performing n-back tasks with three load levels (0-back, 
      1-back, and 2-back tasks). The stimuli in the n-back tasks were the Finnish female 
      name [Saara] uttered in an astonished, angry, frightened, commanding, and scornful 
      mode, and the subjects were instructed to memorize the emotional connotation of the 
      stimuli. Subregions in the prefrontal, parietal, and visual association areas were 
      load-dependently activated during the performance of the n-back tasks. The most 
      consistently activated areas in the prefrontal region were detected in the inferior 
      frontal gyrus corresponding to Brodmann's areas (BAs) 44 and 45 and in the middle 
      and superior frontal gyri (BAs 6/8). Activation was also found in the inferior 
      parietal lobe and intraparietal sulcus (BAs 40/7) and visual association areas 
      including the lingual and fusiform gyri. The results suggest that a distributed 
      neuronal network in occipital, parietal, and frontal areas is involved in working 
      memory processing of emotional content of aurally presented information.

AB  - At present, infrasound (sound frequency < 20 Hz; IS) is being controversially 
      discussed as a potential mediator of several adverse bodily as well as psychological 
      effects. However, it remains unclear, if and in what way IS influences cognition. 
      Here, we conducted an fMRI experiment, in which 13 healthy participants were exposed 
      to IS, while cognitive performance was assessed in an n-back working memory 
      paradigm. During the task, short sinusoidal tone bursts of 12 Hz were administered 
      monaurally with sound pressure levels that had been determined individually in a 
      categorical loudness scaling session prior to the fMRI experiment. We found that 
      task execution was associated with a significant activation of the prefrontal and 
      the parietal cortex, as well as the striatum and the cerebellum, indicating the 
      recruitment of a cognitive control network. Reverse contrast analysis (n-back with 
      tone vs. n-back without tone) revealed a significant activation of the bilateral 
      primary auditory cortex (Brodmann areas 41, 42). Surprisingly, we also found a 
      strong, yet non-significant trend for an improvement of task performance during IS 
      exposure. There was no correlation between performance and brain activity measures 
      in tone and no-tone condition with sum scores of depression-, anxiety-, and 
      personality factor assessment scales (BDI, STAIX1/X2, BFI-S). Although exerting a 
      pronounced effect on cortical brain activity, we obtained no evidence for an 
      impairment of cognition due to brief bursts of IS. On the contrary, potential 
      improvement of working memory function introduces an entirely new aspect to the 
      debate on IS-related effects.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Neurocognitive deficits in pediatric obesity relate to poor developmental 
      outcomes. We sought preliminary evidence for changes in brain and cognitive 
      functioning relevant to obesogenic behavior following vertical sleeve gastrectomy 
      (VSG) in adolescents relative to wait-listed (WL) and healthy controls (HC). 
      METHODS: Thirty-six adolescents underwent fMRI twice 4 months apart, during 
      executive, reward, and episodic memory encoding, in addition to behavioral testing 
      for reward-related decision making. RESULTS: VSG adolescents lost weight, while WL 
      gained weight and HC did not change between time points. Gains in executive and 
      reward-related performance were larger in VSG than control groups. Group × Time 
      interaction (P < 0.05 corrected) in left prefrontal cortex during N-back showed 
      greater presurgical activation and postsurgical reduction comparable to HC levels 
      but increased in WL between time points. Similarly, left striatal parametric 
      response to reward value reduced after surgery to HC levels; WL did not change. 
      Memory-related medial temporal activation did not change in any group. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Results provide pilot evidence for functional brain changes induced by VSG in 
      adolescents with severe obesity. Weight loss and gain were paralleled by reduced and 
      increased prefrontal activation, respectively, suggesting neural plasticity related 
      to metabolic change.

AB  - In daily life, we often need to remember to perform an action after, or at, a 
      specific period of time (e.g., take pizza out of oven in 15 minutes). Surprisingly, 
      little is known about the neural mechanisms that support this form of memory, termed 
      time-based prospective memory (PM). Here we pioneer an fMRI paradigm that enables 
      examination of both sustained and transient processes engaged during time-based PM. 
      Participants were scanned while performing a demanding on-going task (n-back working 
      memory), with and without an additional time-based PM demand. During the PM 
      condition participants could access a hidden clock with a specific button-press 
      response, while in the control condition, pseudo-clocks randomly appeared and were 
      removed via the same response. Analyses tested for sustained activation associated 
      with the PM condition, and also transient activation associated with clock-checks 
      and the PM target response. Contrary to prior findings with event-based PM (i.e., 
      remembering to perform a future action when a specific event occurs), no sustained 
      PM-related activity was observed in anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) or elsewhere 
      in the brain; instead, transient clock-related activity was observed in this region. 
      Critically, the activation was anticipatory, increasing before clock-check 
      responses. Anticipatory activity prior to the PM target response was weaker in aPFC, 
      but strong in pre-Supplementary Motor Area (pre-SMA; relative to clock-check 
      responses), suggesting a functional double dissociation related to volitional 
      decision-making. Together, the results suggest that aPFC-activity dynamics during 
      time-based PM reflect a distinct transient monitoring process, enabling integration 
      of the PM intention with current temporal information to facilitate scheduling of 
      upcoming PM-related actions.

AB  - Working memory (WM) deficit is an important component of impaired cognition in 
      schizophrenia. However, between-studies inconsistencies as to the specific 
      functional substrate imply that inter-individual variability (IIV) in the WM 
      performance is associated with IIV in brain activity in schizophrenia. To examine 
      the neural substrate of this WM IIV, we studied whether the neural mechanisms that 
      underlie individual differences in WM capacity are the same in schizophrenia 
      patients and healthy people. We correlated the IIV of the task-evoked brain activity 
      and task performance during an n-back WM task with the IIV of the moment-to-moment 
      variability in intrinsic resting-state activity, as measured by the amplitude of 
      low-frequency fluctuations (ALFFs) and further compared this relationship between 17 
      patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES) and 18 healthy controls. 
      Between-group comparisons of the correlation patterns indicated aberrant ALFF-WM 
      activation correlations and ALFF-WM performance correlations in the FES patients, 
      but no significant changes were detected in any single measurement of these three 
      characteristics. Specifically, we found increased positive ALFF-WM activation 
      correlations in the bilateral lateral prefrontal cortices, posterior parietal 
      cortices and fusiform gyri in the FES patients. We also observed significant 
      increases in positive ALFF-WM performance correlations in the bilateral ventromedial 
      prefrontal cortices in the FES patients. This hyper-coupling between the ALFF and 
      fMRI measures during a WM task may indicate that it was difficult for the patients 
      to detach themselves from one state to transition to another and suggests that the 
      inefficient cortical function in schizophrenia stems from the intrinsic functional 
      architecture of the brain.

TI  - Fish Oil Supplementation Increases Event-Related Posterior Cingulate Activation in 
      Older Adults with Subjective Memory Impairment.
PG  - 161-9
LID - 10.1007/s12603-015-0609-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of long-chain omega-3 (LCn-3) fatty acids found 
      in fish oil, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), 
      on cortical blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activity during a working memory 
      task in older adults with subjective memory impairment. DESIGN: Randomized, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Academic medical center. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Healthy older adults (62-80 years) with subjective memory impairment, 
      but not meeting criteria for mild cognitive impairment or dementia. INTERVENTION: 
      Fish oil (EPA+DHA: 2.4 g/d, n=11) or placebo (corn oil, n=10) for 24 weeks. 
      MEASUREMENTS: Cortical BOLD response patterns during performance of a sequential 
      letter n-back working memory task were determined at baseline and week 24 by 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). RESULTS: At 24 weeks erythrocyte 
      membrane EPA+DHA composition increased significantly from baseline in participants 
      receiving fish oil (+31%, p ≤ 0.0001) but not placebo (-17%, p=0.06). Multivariate 
      modeling of fMRI data identified a significant interaction among treatment, visit, 
      and memory loading in the right cingulate (BA 23/24), and in the right sensorimotor 
      area (BA 3/4). In the fish oil group, BOLD increases at 24 weeks were observed in 
      the right posterior cingulate and left superior frontal regions during memory 
      loading. A region-of-interest analysis indicated that the baseline to endpoint 
      change in posterior cingulate cortex BOLD activity signal was significantly greater 
      in the fish oil group compared with the placebo group during the 1-back (p=0.0003) 
      and 2-back (p=0.0005) conditions. Among all participants, the change in erythrocyte 
      EPA+DHA during the intervention was associated with performance in the 2-back 
      working memory task (p = 0.01), and with cingulate BOLD signal during the 1-back (p 
      = 0.005) with a trend during the 2-back (p = 0.09). Further, cingulate BOLD activity 
      was related to performance in the 2-back condition. CONCLUSION: Dietary fish oil 
      supplementation increases red blood cell omega-3 content, working memory 
      performance, and BOLD signal in the posterior cingulate cortex during greater 
      working memory load in older adults with subjective memory impairment suggesting 
      enhanced neuronal response to working memory challenge.

TI  - Brain Mechanisms of Social Threat Effects on Working Memory.
PG  - 544-556
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhu206 [doi]
AB  - Social threat can have adverse effects on cognitive performance, but the brain 
      mechanisms underlying its effects are poorly understood. We investigated the effects 
      of social evaluative threat on working memory (WM), a core component of many 
      important cognitive capabilities. Social threat impaired WM performance during an 
      N-back task and produced widespread reductions in activation in lateral prefrontal 
      cortex and intraparietal sulcus (IPS), among other regions. In addition, activity in 
      frontal and parietal regions predicted WM performance, and mediation analyses 
      identified regions in the bilateral IPS that mediated the performance-impairing 
      effects of social threat. Social threat also decreased connectivity between the IPS 
      and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, while increasing connectivity between the IPS 
      and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a region strongly implicated in the 
      generation of autonomic and emotional responses. Finally, cortisol response to the 
      stressor did not mediate WM impairment but was rather associated with protective 
      effects. These results provide a basis for understanding interactions between social 
      and cognitive processes at a neural systems level.

AB  - Variation in prefrontal dopaminergic signaling mediated by D2 receptor has been 
      implicated in cognitive phenotypes of schizophrenia, including working memory. 
      Molecular cascades downstream of D2 receptor include a cAMP-dependent- and a 
      cAMP-independent-pathway. Protein-Phosphatase-2A (PP2A) is a key partner of D2 
      receptor in cAMP-independent signaling. This enzyme comprises a regulatory subunit 
      that is coded by PPP2R2B gene. Given the molecular relationship between PP2A and D2 
      signaling, we hypothesized genetic variation in PPP2R2B affecting mRNA expression of 
      this gene in prefrontal cortex to be associated with prefrontal processing during 
      working memory. In order to probe such a hypothesis we investigated SNPs associated 
      with PPP2R2B expression in two independent samples of human postmortem prefrontal 
      cortex. Then, we tested SNPs for which association was replicated as predictors of 
      prefrontal activity during WM as probed by functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) in a 
      sample of healthy humans. We found that a SNP associated with PPP2R2B expression 
      (rs959627) predicted prefrontal activity during the N-Back working memory task. In 
      particular, individuals carrying rs959627T allele, a condition associated with lower 
      PPP2R2B expression in postmortem prefrontal cortex, showed greater activity in right 
      inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) during N-Back compared to CC subjects. Furthermore, 
      such an activity was negatively correlated with behavioral performance at the task. 
      Consistently with previous studies, these findings suggest reduced right IFG 
      efficiency during working memory processing in rs959627 T-carriers, as indexed by 
      their greater need to activate this brain region in order to achieve similar levels 
      of behavioral proficiency as compared to CC individuals.

TI  - Failure to deactivate in the prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia: dysfunction of the 
      default mode network?
PG  - 1185-93
LID - 10.1017/S0033291708003565 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional imaging studies using working memory tasks have documented 
      both prefrontal cortex (PFC) hypo- and hyperactivation in schizophrenia. However, 
      these studies have often failed to consider the potential role of task-related 
      deactivation. METHOD: Thirty-two patients with chronic schizophrenia and 32 age- and 
      sex-matched normal controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
      scanning while performing baseline, 1-back and 2-back versions of the n-back task. 
      Linear models were used to obtain maps of activations and deactivations in the 
      groups. RESULTS: The controls showed activation in the expected frontal regions. 
      There were also clusters of deactivation, particularly in the anterior 
      cingulate/ventromedial PFC and the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus. Compared to 
      the controls, the schizophrenic patients showed reduced activation in the right 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and other frontal areas. There was also an 
      area in the anterior cingulate/ventromedial PFC where the patients showed apparently 
      greater activation than the controls. This represented a failure of deactivation in 
      the schizophrenic patients. Failure to activate was a function of the patients' 
      impaired performance on the n-back task, whereas the failure to deactivate was less 
      performance dependent. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with schizophrenia show both failure to 
      activate and failure to deactivate during performance of a working memory task. The 
      area of failure of deactivation is in the anterior prefrontal/anterior cingulate 
      cortex and corresponds to one of the two midline components of the 'default mode 
      network' implicated in functions related to maintaining one's sense of self.

TI  - Does traditional asian vegetables (ulam) consumption correlate with brain activity 
      using fMRI? A study among aging adults from low-income households.
PG  - 1142-1153
LID - 10.1002/jmri.26891 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Working memory and cognitive flexibility are supported by the 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Aging adults from low-income households are 
      individuals with a high risk of cognitive decline who incorporate ulam in their 
      daily diet. PURPOSE: To examine relationship between ulam consumption and the 
      working memory and cognitive flexibility among aging adults from low-income 
      households who are more susceptible to cognitive decline. STUDY TYPE: 
      Cross-sectional. POPULATION/SUBJECTS: Thirty-two aging adults (45-75 years old). 
      FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: Task-based fMRI, 3.0T, T(1) -weighted anatomical images, 
      T(2) *-weighted imaging data. ASSESSMENT: The dietary and ulam consumption were 
      assessed using the respective validated Dietary History and semiquantitative Food 
      Frequency questionnaires. Working memory and cognitive flexibility were evaluated by 
      using neuropsychological batteries (ie, mini-mental state examination [MMSE], Digit 
      Span, and Rey auditory verbal learning test [RAVLT]) and task-based fMRI (N-back and 
      Stroop Color Word Test [SCWT]). Brodmann's areas 9 and 46 were the regions of 
      interest (ROIs) of DLPFC activation. STATISTICAL TESTS: Multiple linear regression 
      used to understand the relationship between ulam consumption and the working memory 
      and cognitive flexibility, while analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare 
      the difference of working memory and cognitive flexibility among four percentiles of 
      ulam consumption, after age, gender, and education years adjustments. Significance 
      was decided by two-sided, P < 0.0042 and P < 0.05. RESULTS: The multiple linear 
      regression revealed that ulam consumption was positively associated with the Digit 
      Span (R(2) = 0.51, β = 0.702, P < 0.001), right DLPFC activation (1-back) (R(2) = 
      0.34, β = 0.591, P = 0.001), left DLPFC activation (SCWT-1) (R(2) = 0.33, β = 0.553, 
      P = 0.002), and left DLPFC activation (SCWT-2) (R(2) = 0.34, β = 0.497, P = 0.004). 
      The ulam consumption at the 75(th) and 100(th) percentile from the ANCOVA analysis 
      had shown a better working memory and cognitive flexibility as compared with those 
      of the 25(th) and 50(th) percentiles (P < 0.05). DATA CONCLUSION: This study found 
      that high ulam consumption was related to a high intensity of brain activation in 
      DLPFC; however, the elucidation of the neuroprotective properties of ulam have yet 
      to be established from clinical trial studies. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2 Technical

TI  - Quantification of Load Dependent Brain Activity in Parametric N-Back Working Memory 
      Tasks using Pseudo-continuous Arterial Spin Labeling (pCASL) Perfusion Imaging.
PG  - 127-210
AB  - Brain activation and deactivation induced by N-back working memory tasks and their 
      load effects have been extensively investigated using positron emission tomography 
      (PET) and blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI). However, the underlying mechanisms of BOLD fMRI are still not 
      completely understood and PET imaging requires injection of radioactive tracers. In 
      this study, a pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) perfusion imaging 
      technique was used to quantify cerebral blood flow (CBF), a well understood 
      physiological index reflective of cerebral metabolism, in N-back working memory 
      tasks. Using pCASL, we systematically investigated brain activation and deactivation 
      induced by the N-back working memory tasks and further studied the load effects on 
      brain activity based on quantitative CBF. Our data show increased CBF in the 
      fronto-parietal cortices, thalamus, caudate, and cerebellar regions, and decreased 
      CBF in the posterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex, during the 
      working memory tasks. Most of the activated/deactivated brain regions show an 
      approximately linear relationship between CBF and task loads (0, 1, 2 and 3 back), 
      although several regions show non-linear relationships (quadratic and cubic). The 
      CBF-based spatial patterns of brain activation/deactivation and load effects from 
      this study agree well with those obtained from BOLD fMRI and PET techniques. These 
      results demonstrate the feasibility of ASL techniques to quantify human brain 
      activity during high cognitive tasks, suggesting its potential application to 
      assessing the mechanisms of cognitive deficits in neuropsychiatric and neurological 
      disorders.

TI  - Working memory brain activation following severe traumatic brain injury.
PG  - 95-111
AB  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown that brain activation during 
      performance of working memory (WM) tasks under high memory loads is altered in 
      adults with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) relative to uninjured subjects 
      (Perlstein et al., 2004; Scheibel et al., 2003). Our study attempted to equate TBI 
      patients and orthopedically injured (OI) subjects on performance of an N-Back task 
      that used faces as stimuli. To minimize confusion in TBI patients that was revealed 
      in pilot work, we presented the memory conditions in two separate tasks, 0- versus 
      1-back and 0- versus 2-back. In the 0- versus 1-back task, OI subjects activated 
      bilateral frontal areas more extensively than TBI patients, and TBI patients 
      activated posterior regions more extensively than OI subjects. In the 0- versus 
      2-back task, there were no significant differences between the groups. Analysis of 
      changes in activation over time on 1-back disclosed that OI subjects had decreases 
      in bilateral anterior and posterior regions, while TBI patients showed activation 
      increases in those and other areas over time. In the 2-back condition, both groups 
      showed decreases over time in fusiform and parahippocampal gyri, although the OI 
      group also showed increases over time in frontal, parietal, and temporal areas not 
      seen in the TBI patients. The greatest group differences were found in the 1-back 
      condition, which places low demand on WM. Although the extent of activation in the 
      2-back condition did not differ between the two groups, deactivation in the 2-back 
      condition was seen in the OI patients only, and both groups' patterns of activation 
      over time varied, suggesting a dissociation between the TBI and OI patients in 
      recruitment of neural areas mediating WM.

TI  - Baseline activity predicts working memory load of preceding task condition.
PG  - 3010-22
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22121 [doi]
AB  - The conceptual notion of the so-called resting state of the brain has been recently 
      challenged by studies indicating a continuing effect of cognitive processes on 
      subsequent rest. In particular, activity in posterior parietal and medial prefrontal 
      areas has been found to be modulated by preceding experimental conditions. In this 
      study, we investigated which brain areas show working memory dependent patterns in 
      subsequent baseline periods and how specific they are for the preceding experimental 
      condition. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, 94 subjects performed a 
      letter-version of the n-back task with the conditions 0-back and 2-back followed by 
      a low-level baseline in which subjects had to passively observe the letters 
      appearing. In a univariate analysis, 2-back served as control condition while 
      0-back, baseline after 0-back and baseline after 2-back were modeled as regressors 
      to test for activity changes between both baseline conditions. Additionally, we 
      tested, using Gaussian process classifiers, the recognition of task condition from 
      functional images acquired during baseline. Besides the expected activity changes in 
      the precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex, we found differential activity in the 
      thalamus, putamen, and postcentral gyrus that were affected by the preceding task. 
      The multivariate analysis revealed that images of the subsequent baseline block 
      contain task related patterns that yield a recognition rate of 70%. The results 
      suggest that the influence of a cognitive task on subsequent baseline is strong and 
      specific for some areas but not restricted to areas of the so-called default mode 
      network.

TI  - A rapid fMRI task battery for mapping of visual, motor, cognitive, and emotional 
      function.
PG  - 732-44
AB  - A set of sensory, motor, cognitive, and emotional tasks were combined in a simple, 
      rapid-presentation task battery and tested on a group of 31, normal, healthy 
      subjects aged 22 to 76. Five tasks were selected on the basis of widespread use in 
      fMRI and their ability to produce robust and reliable regional activations. They 
      were (1) a visual task designed to activate the occipital cortex; (2) a bimanual 
      motor task designed to activate motor areas; (3) a verb generation task designed to 
      activate speech processing areas; (4) an n-back task designed to activate areas 
      associated with working memory and executive function; and (5) an emotional pictures 
      task designed to provoke strong emotional responses that typically activate limbic 
      structures. Most of the tasks produced reliable activations in individual subjects, 
      and assessments of the distribution and reliability of individual subject 
      activations in each targeted area are provided. The emotional pictures task did not 
      demonstrate adequate sensitivity in a priori target regions, only in the a 
      posteriori defined inferior temporal region. Age- and gender-specific differences 
      were found in the activation patterns for both the cognitive and emotional tasks. 
      The battery provides a prescribed means for researchers to obtain reliable 
      functional localizers within 20-25 min of scanning, which can be used to support 
      more elaborate mapping studies of brain function. The dataset can also serve as a 
      reliability metric for new fMRI laboratories and novice investigators seeking to 
      test their acquisition and analysis techniques with minimal time investment and 
      expense.

TI  - Increase or Decrease of fMRI Activity in Adult Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity 
      Disorder: Does It Depend on Task Difficulty?
LID - pyw049 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ijnp/pyw049 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder has been shown to affect 
      working memory, and fMRI studies in children and adolescents with attention 
      deficit/hyperactivity disorder report hypoactivation in task-related attentional 
      networks. However, studies with adult attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
      patients addressing this issue as well as the effects of clinically valid 
      methylphenidate treatment are scarce. This study contributes to closing this gap. 
      METHODS: Thirty-five adult patients were randomized to 6 weeks of double-blind 
      placebo or methylphenidate treatment. Patients completed an fMRI n-back working 
      memory task both before and after the assigned treatment, and matched healthy 
      controls were tested and compared to the untreated patients. RESULTS: There were no 
      whole-brain differences between any of the groups. However, when specified regions 
      of interest were investigated, the patient group showed enhanced BOLD responses in 
      dorsal and ventral areas before treatment. This increase was correlated with 
      performance across all participants and with attention deficit/hyperactivity 
      disorder symptoms in the patient group. Furthermore, we found an effect of treatment 
      in the right superior frontal gyrus, with methylphenidate-treated patients 
      exhibiting increased activation, which was absent in the placebo-treated patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate distinct activation differences between untreated 
      adult attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder patients and matched healthy controls 
      during a working memory task. These differences might reflect compensatory efforts 
      by the patients, who are performing at the same level as the healthy controls. We 
      furthermore found a positive effect of methylphenidate on the activation of a 
      frontal region of interest. These observations contribute to a more thorough 
      understanding of adult attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and provide impulses 
      for the evaluation of therapy-related changes.

TI  - Working memory of auditory localization.
PG  - 889-98
AB  - To investigate brain mechanisms of sound location memory, we studied the 
      distribution of brain activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
      in subjects performing an audiospatial n-back task with three memory load levels. 
      Working memory processing of audiospatial information activated areas in the 
      superior, middle and inferior frontal gyri, and in the posterior parietal and middle 
      temporal cortices. In a control experiment, fMRI during audio- and visuospatial 
      2-back task performances revealed only few differentially activated subregions 
      between the two tasks. These results demonstrate that working memory processing of 
      auditory locations involves a distributed network of brain areas and suggest that 
      mnemonic processing of audio- and visuospatial information is directed along a 
      common neural pathway in the posterior parietal and prefrontal cortices.

TI  - Cognitive Fatigue Is Associated with Altered Functional Connectivity in 
      Interoceptive and Reward Pathways in Multiple Sclerosis.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics10110930 [doi]
LID - 930
AB  - Cognitive fatigue is common and debilitating among persons with multiple sclerosis 
      (pwMS). Neural mechanisms underlying fatigue are not well understood, which results 
      in lack of adequate treatment. The current study examined cognitive fatigue-related 
      functional connectivity among 26 pwMS and 14 demographically matched healthy 
      controls (HCs). Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
      scanning while performing a working memory task (n-back), with two conditions: one 
      with higher cognitive load (2-back) to induce fatigue and one with lower cognitive 
      load (0-back) as a control condition. Task-independent residual functional 
      connectivity was assessed, with seeds in brain regions previously implicated in 
      cognitive fatigue (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), ventromedial prefrontal 
      cortex (vmPFC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), insula, and striatum). 
      Cognitive fatigue was measured using the Visual Analogue Scale of Fatigue (VAS-F). 
      Results indicated that as VAS-F scores increased, HCs showed increased residual 
      functional connectivity between the striatum and the vmPFC (crucial in reward 
      processing) during the 2-back condition compared to the 0-back condition. In 
      contrast, pwMS displayed increased residual functional connectivity from 
      interoceptive hubs-the insula and the dACC-to the striatum. In conclusion, pwMS 
      showed a hyperconnectivity within the interoceptive network and disconnection within 
      the reward circuitry when experiencing cognitive fatigue.

TI  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging of working memory in Huntington's disease: 
      cross-sectional data from the IMAGE-HD study.
PG  - 1847-64
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22296 [doi]
AB  - We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate spatial working 
      memory (WM) in an N-BACK task (0, 1, and 2-BACK) in premanifest Huntington's disease 
      (pre-HD, n = 35), early symptomatic Huntington's disease (symp-HD, n = 23), and 
      control (n = 32) individuals. Overall, both WM conditions (1-BACK and 2-BACK) 
      activated a large network of regions throughout the brain, common to all groups. 
      However, voxel-wise and time-course analyses revealed significant functional group 
      differences, despite no significant behavioral performance differences. During 
      1-BACK, voxel-wise blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal activity was 
      significantly reduced in a number of regions from the WM network (inferior frontal 
      gyrus, anterior insula, caudate, putamen, and cerebellum) in pre-HD and symp-HD 
      groups, compared with controls; however, time-course analysis of the BOLD response 
      in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) showed increased activation in 
      symp-HD, compared with pre-HD and controls. The pattern of reduced voxel-wise BOLD 
      activity in pre-HD and symp-HD, relative to controls, became more pervasive during 
      2-BACK affecting the same structures as in 1-BACK, but also incorporated further WM 
      regions (anterior cingulate gyrus, parietal lobe and thalamus). The DLPFC BOLD 
      time-course for 2-BACK showed a reversed pattern to that observed in 1-BACK, with a 
      significantly diminished signal in symp-HD, relative to pre-HD and controls. Our 
      findings provide support for functional brain reorganisation in cortical and 
      subcortical regions in both pre-HD and symp-HD, which are modulated by task 
      difficulty. Moreover, the lack of a robust striatal BOLD signal in pre-HD may 
      represent a very early signature of change observed up to 15 years prior to clinical 
      diagnosis.

TI  - Association between glutamate/glutamine and blood oxygen level dependent signal in 
      the left dorsolateral prefrontal region during verbal working memory.
PG  - 478-482
LID - 10.1097/WNR.0000000000001000 [doi]
AB  - Functional MRI (fMRI) has provided much insight into the changes in the neuronal 
      activity on the basis of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) phenomenon. The dynamic 
      changes in the metabolites can be detected using functional proton magnetic 
      resonance spectroscopy (H-fMRS). The strategy of combining fMRI and H-fMRS would 
      facilitate the understanding of the neurochemical interpretation of the BOLD signal. 
      The dorsolateral prefrontal region is critically involved in the processing of 
      working memory (WM), as demonstrated by the studies involving the neuroimaging, 
      neuropsychological, and electrophysiological experiments. In this study, we tested 
      the association between BOLD signal and changes in brain metabolites in the left 
      dorsolateral prefrontal region using N-back verbal WM task. We used single-voxel 
      task-based H-MRS acquired in the left dorsolateral prefrontal region and fMRI during 
      the performance of N-back verbal WM task to investigate the association between 
      changes in metabolites and BOLD response in 10 healthy participants. The correlation 
      between changes in metabolites and percent signal change was examined by the Pearson 
      correlation. The Pearson correlation analysis revealed a significant positive 
      correlation between the BOLD signal and glutamate/glutamine in the left dorsolateral 
      prefrontal region during the verbal WM. Our finding suggests that 
      glutamate/glutamine cycle plays a critical role in the neuronal activation as 
      reflected by the changes in the BOLD response.

AB  - Even more than in cognitive research applications, moving fMRI to the clinic and the 
      drug development process requires the generation of stable and reliable signal 
      changes. The performance characteristics of the fMRI paradigm constrain experimental 
      power and may require different study designs (e.g., crossover vs. parallel groups), 
      yet fMRI reliability characteristics can be strongly dependent on the nature of the 
      fMRI task. The present study investigated both within-subject and group-level 
      reliability of a combined three-task fMRI battery targeting three systems of wide 
      applicability in clinical and cognitive neuroscience: an emotional (face matching), 
      a motivational (monetary reward anticipation) and a cognitive (n-back working 
      memory) task. A group of 25 young, healthy volunteers were scanned twice on a 3T MRI 
      scanner with a mean test-retest interval of 14.6 days. FMRI reliability was 
      quantified using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) applied at three 
      different levels ranging from a global to a localized and fine spatial scale: (1) 
      reliability of group-level activation maps over the whole brain and within targeted 
      regions of interest (ROIs); (2) within-subject reliability of ROI-mean amplitudes 
      and (3) within-subject reliability of individual voxels in the target ROIs. Results 
      showed robust evoked activation of all three tasks in their respective target 
      regions (emotional task=amygdala; motivational task=ventral striatum; cognitive 
      task=right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and parietal cortices) with high effect 
      sizes (ES) of ROI-mean summary values (ES=1.11-1.44 for the faces task, 0.96-1.43 
      for the reward task, 0.83-2.58 for the n-back task). Reliability of group level 
      activation was excellent for all three tasks with ICCs of 0.89-0.98 at the whole 
      brain level and 0.66-0.97 within target ROIs. Within-subject reliability of ROI-mean 
      amplitudes across sessions was fair to good for the reward task (ICCs=0.56-0.62) 
      and, dependent on the particular ROI, also fair-to-good for the n-back task 
      (ICCs=0.44-0.57) but lower for the faces task (ICC=-0.02-0.16). In conclusion, all 
      three tasks are well suited to between-subject designs, including imaging genetics. 
      When specific recommendations are followed, the n-back and reward task are also 
      suited for within-subject designs, including pharmaco-fMRI. The present study 
      provides task-specific fMRI reliability performance measures that will inform the 
      optimal use, powering and design of fMRI studies using comparable tasks.

TI  - Mild Jugular Compression Collar Ameliorated Changes in Brain Activation of Working 
      Memory after One Soccer Season in Female High School Athletes.
PG  - 1248-1259
LID - 10.1089/neu.2017.5262 [doi]
AB  - Recent neuroimaging studies have suggested that repetitive subconcussive head 
      impacts, even after only one sport season, may lead to pre- to post-season 
      structural and functional alterations in male high school football athletes. 
      However, data on female athletes are limited. In the current investigation, we aimed 
      to (1) assess the longitudinal pre- to post-season changes in functional MRI (fMRI) 
      of working memory and working memory performance, (2) quantify the association 
      between the pre- to post-season change in fMRI of working memory and the exposure to 
      head impact and working memory performance, and (3) assess whether wearing a neck 
      collar designed to reduce intracranial slosh via mild compression of the jugular 
      veins can ameliorate the changes in fMRI brain activation observed in the female 
      high school athletes who did not wear collars after a full soccer season. A total of 
      48 female high school soccer athletes (age range: 14.00-17.97 years) were included 
      in the study. These athletes were assigned to the non-collar group (n = 21) or to 
      the collar group (n = 27). All athletes undewent MRI at both pre-season and 
      post-season. In each session, a fMRI verbal N-Back task was used to engage working 
      memory. A significant pre- to post-season increase in fMRI blood oxygen level 
      dependent (BOLD) signal was demonstrated when performing the N-back working memory 
      task in the non-collar group but not in the collar group, despite the comparable 
      exposure to head impacts during the season between the two groups. The collar group 
      demonstrated significantly smaller pre- to post-season change in fMRI BOLD signal 
      than the non-collar group, suggesting a potential protective effect from the collar 
      device. Significant correlations were also found between the pre- to post-season 
      increase in fMRI brain activation and the decrease in task accuracy in the 
      non-collar group, indicating an association between the compensatory mechanism in 
      underlying neurophysiology and the alteration in the behavioral outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The search for a validated neuroimaging-based brain marker in psychiatry 
      has thus far been fraught with both clinical and methodological difficulties. The 
      present study aimed to apply a novel data-driven machine-learning approach to 
      functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data obtained during a cognitive task 
      in order to delineate the neural mechanisms involved in two schizophrenia subgroups: 
      schizophrenia patients with and without Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). 
      METHODS: 16 schizophrenia patients with OCD ("schizo-obsessive"), 17 pure 
      schizophrenia patients, and 20 healthy controls underwent fMRI while performing a 
      working memory task. A whole brain search for activation clusters of cognitive load 
      was performed using a recently developed data-driven multi-voxel pattern analysis 
      (MVPA) approach, termed Searchlight Based Feature Extraction (SBFE), and which 
      yields a robust fMRI-based classifier. RESULTS: The SBFE successfully classified the 
      two schizophrenia groups with 91% accuracy based on activations in the right 
      intraparietal sulcus (r-IPS), which further correlated with reduced symptom severity 
      among schizo-obsessive patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that this novel 
      SBFE approach can successfully delineate between symptom dimensions in the context 
      of complex psychiatric morbidity.

TI  - Neural correlates of working memory in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy--an fMRI study.
PG  - 1696-703
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.01.126 [doi]
AB  - It has traditionally been held that the hippocampus is not part of the neural 
      substrate of working memory (WM), and that WM is preserved in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy 
      (TLE). Recent imaging and neuropsychological data suggest this view may need 
      revision. The aim of this study was to investigate the neural correlates of WM in 
      TLE using functional MRI (fMRI). We used a visuo-spatial 'n-back' paradigm to 
      compare WM network activity in 38 unilateral hippocampal sclerosis (HS) patients (19 
      left) and 15 healthy controls. WM performance was impaired in both left and right HS 
      groups compared to controls. The TLE groups showed reduced right superior parietal 
      lobe activity during single- and multiple-item WM. No significant hippocampal 
      activation was found during the active task in any group, but the hippocampi 
      progressively deactivated as the task demand increased. This effect was bilateral 
      for controls, whereas the TLE patients showed progressive unilateral deactivation 
      only contralateral to the side of the hippocampal sclerosis and seizure focus. 
      Progressive deactivation of the posterior medial temporal lobe was associated with 
      better performance in all groups. Our results suggest that WM is impaired in 
      unilateral HS and the underlying neural correlates of WM are disrupted. Our findings 
      suggest that hippocampal activity is progressively suppressed as the WM load 
      increases, with maintenance of good performance. Implications for understanding the 
      role of the hippocampus in WM are discussed.

TI  - Age-related differences in working memory deficits during nicotine withdrawal.
PG  - 907-17
LID - 10.1111/adb.12051 [doi]
AB  - Nicotine withdrawal is associated with subtle working memory deficits that predict 
      subsequent relapse. We examined the neural substrates underlying these processes in 
      treatment-seeking smokers, and explored the moderating influence of age on 
      abstinence-induced alterations in brain activity and performance. Sixty-three 
      smokers participated in two blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging scans while performing a visual N-back task on two separate 
      occasions: smoking as usual and after 24 hours of biochemically confirmed abstinence 
      (order counterbalanced). Abstinence (versus smoking) led to reduced accuracy, slower 
      median correct response time and reduced BOLD signal change in the three a priori 
      regions of interest: medial frontal/cingulate gyrus and right and left dorsolateral 
      prefrontal cortex. Significant age × session effects were found for BOLD signal 
      change in all three regions, as well as for withdrawal and craving; for all 
      measures, abstinence effects were attenuated in smokers aged ≥50 years compared with 
      those <50 years old. These results suggest that abstinence effects on neurocognitive 
      function may be more pronounced for younger smokers, and may indicate a new avenue 
      for research exploring mechanisms underlying age differences in smoking cessation 
      success.

AB  - Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder associated with disruption of prefrontal 
      cortex (PFC) development and executive dysfunction. To date, however, there is 
      little evidence directly linking these two sequelae of PKU. We utilized functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate prefrontal functioning in six 
      individuals with early-treated PKU (ETPKU) during performance of an n-back working 
      memory task and compared results with those of six age- and gender-matched 
      neurologically intact individuals. In addition, we evaluated the possible presence 
      of PKU-related disruptions in functional connectivity, as might be hypothesized 
      based on prior reports of white matter injury in individuals with ETPKU. A number of 
      brain regions, nearly half of which were located in the PFC, were found to show 
      atypical neural activity in individuals with ETPKU during working memory 
      performance. We also found decreased connectivity both within the PFC as well as 
      between the PFC and other brain regions in individuals with ETPKU compared with 
      controls. Results from this preliminary study suggest that both prefrontal 
      dysfunction and disruptions in functional connectivity may contribute to PKU-related 
      executive impairment. In addition to advancing our understanding of PKU, the current 
      findings have a broader impact in that PKU is regularly used as a model of early 
      prefrontal dysfunction in the study of other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., 
      autism).

TI  - Established donepezil treatment modulates task relevant regional brain activation in 
      early Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 415-27
AB  - Neuroimaging studies of cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) treatment in Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) have shown the different short and long term actions of ChEIs. fMRI 
      studies of the ChEI donepezil have focused on its short to medium term action 
      without exploring the effects of established treatment. In this exploratory study 
      the effect of 20 weeks donepezil treatment on regional brain activity was measured 
      with fMRI in patients with mild AD. Twelve patients with probable AD and nine 
      age-matched controls were assessed with a Pyramids and Palm Trees semantic 
      association fMRI paradigm and an n-back working memory fMRI paradigm. In the patient 
      group only, the assessment was repeated after 20 weeks of treatment. After 
      treatment, differences from normal healthy elderly became more pronounced. There was 
      also a spread of deactivation which at retest was detectable in task relevant areas. 
      Behaviourally, however, there were no significant differences between group baseline 
      and retest scores, with a range of performance probably reflecting variation in drug 
      efficacy across patients. Parametric analyses established that increased behavioural 
      scores at retest correlated significantly with higher activation levels in non task 
      relevant areas. Behavioural stability with donepezil treatment was not paralleled by 
      the pattern of improved task specific brain activation reported in similar studies 
      of other ChEIs. This is arguably related to the different mechanisms of action of 
      the ChEIs and might be a clinical correlate of the reported synaptic upregulation 
      following long term donepezil treatment.

AB  - While the neural correlates of identity monitoring working memory (WM) have been 
      well characterised in literature, the WM subsystems for different types of stimuli 
      have not been established. The aim of our study was to examine the neural network 
      subtending WM for identity monitoring of both verbal and visual stimuli. We used 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with words, objects, and faces as 
      stimuli in an n-back WM task to delineate the similarities and differences in brain 
      activation during presentation of verbal and visual stimuli. The results revealed a 
      predominantly left lateralized core fronto-parieto-cerebellar identity WM network 
      comprising bilateral insula, left inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal gyrus, 
      and cerebellum that is common to all stimuli. In addition, our results showed 
      stimulus-specific recruitment of brain regions, with exclusive activations in left 
      inferior frontal gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus for identity WM for verbal 
      stimuli, and left middle occipital gyrus and cerebellum for identity WM for visual 
      stimuli. The present study reveals the existence of a central identity WM network 
      for both verbal and visual information, along with activation of distinct verbal and 
      visual representational regions that are sensitive to respective stimuli.

AB  - Literature regarding verbal working memory (vWM) in anorexia nervosa (AN) has been 
      inconsistent due to a misunderstanding of the key components of vWM and introduction 
      of confounding stimuli. Furthermore, there are no studies looking at how brain 
      function in people with AN relates to vWM performance. The present study used 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a letter n-back paradigm to study 
      the effect of increasing vWM task difficulty on cortical functioning in the largest 
      AN sample to date (n=31). Although the AN group had low BMI and higher anxious and 
      depressive symptomology compared to age-matched controls (HC), there were no 
      between-group differences in accuracy and speed at any task difficulty. fMRI data 
      revealed no regions exhibiting significant differences in activation when groups 
      were compared at each difficulty separately and no regions showing group x condition 
      interaction. Although there was a trend towards lower accuracy as duration of 
      illness increased, this was not correlated with activity in regions associated with 
      vWM. These findings indicate that vWM in AN is as efficient and performed using the 
      same cognitive strategy as HC, and that there may not be a need for therapies to 
      pursue remediation of this particular neurocognitive faculty.

AB  - Inheriting two (10/10) relative to one (9/10) copy of the 10-repeat allele of the 
      dopamine transporter genotype (DAT1) is associated with Attention Deficit 
      Hyperactivity Disorder, a childhood disorder marked by poor executive function. We 
      examined whether functional anatomy underlying working memory, a component process 
      of executive function, differed by DAT1 in 7-12 year-old typically developing 
      children. 10/10 and 9/10 carriers performed a verbal n-back task in two functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) runs varying in working memory load, high (2-back 
      vs. 1-back) and low (1-back vs. 0-back). Performance accuracy was superior in 9/10 
      than 10/10 carriers in the high but not low load runs. Examination of each run 
      separately revealed that frontal-striatal-parietal regions were more activated in 
      9/10 than 10/10 carriers in the high load run; the groups did not differ in the low 
      load run. Examination of load effects revealed a DAT1xLoad interaction in the right 
      hemisphere in the caudate, our a priori region of interest. Exploratory analysis at 
      a more liberal threshold revealed this interaction in other basal ganglia regions 
      (putamen, and substantial nigra/subthalamic nuclei - SN/STN) and in medial parietal 
      cortex (left precuneus). The striatal and parietal regions were more activated in 
      9/10 carriers under high than low load, and DAT1 differences (9/10>10/10) were 
      evident only under high load. In contrast, SN/STN tended to be more activated in 
      10/10 carriers under low than high load and DAT1 differences (10/10>9/10) were 
      evident only under low load. Thus, 10-repeat homozygosity of DAT1 was associated 
      with reduced performance and a lack of increased basal ganglia involvement under 
      higher working memory demands.

AB  - The CB1 cannabinoid receptor is targeted in the brain by endocannabinoids under 
      physiological conditions as well as by delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol under cannabis 
      use. Furthermore, its signaling appears to affect brain cognitive processing. Recent 
      findings highlight a crucial role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the mechanism of 
      intraneuronal CB1 signaling transduction, while others indicate that two single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs1406977 and rs20417) modulate expression of CB1 
      (CNR1) and COX-2 (PTGS2) coding genes, respectively. Here, our aim was to use fMRI 
      to investigate in healthy humans whether these SNPs interact in modulating 
      prefrontal activity during working memory processing and if this modulation is 
      linked with cannabis use. We recruited 242 healthy subjects genotyped for CNR1 
      rs1406977 and PTGS2 rs20417 that performed the N-back working memory task during 
      fMRI and were interviewed using the Cannabis Experience Questionnaire (CEQ). We 
      found that the interaction between CNR1 rs1406977 and PTGS2 rs20417 is associated 
      with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity such that specific genotype 
      configurations (CNR1 C carriers/PTGS2 C carriers and CNR1 TT/PTGS2 GG) predict lower 
      cortical response versus others in spite of similar behavioral accuracy. 
      Furthermore, DLPFC activity in the cluster associated with the CNR1 by PTGS2 
      interaction was negatively correlated with behavioral efficiency and positively 
      correlated with frequency of cannabis use in cannabis users. These results suggest 
      that a genetically modulated balancing of signaling within the CB1-COX-2 pathway may 
      reflect on more or less efficient patterns of prefrontal activity during working 
      memory. Frequency of cannabis use may be a factor for further modulation of 
      CNR1/PTGS2-mediated cortical processing associated with this cognitive process.

AB  - Brain regions simultaneously activated during any cognitive process are functionally 
      connected, forming large-scale networks. These functional networks can be examined 
      during active conditions [i.e., task-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)] 
      and also in passive states (resting-fMRI), where the default mode network (DMN) is 
      the most widely investigated system. The role of the DMN remains unclear, although 
      it is known to be responsible for the shift between resting and focused attention 
      processing. There is also some evidence for its malleability in relation to previous 
      experience. Here we investigated brain connectivity patterns in 16 healthy young 
      subjects by using an n-back task with increasing levels of memory load within the 
      fMRI context. Prior to this working memory (WM) task, participants were trained 
      outside fMRI with a shortened test version. Immediately after, they underwent a 
      resting-state fMRI acquisition followed by the full fMRI n-back test. We observed 
      that the degree of intrinsic correlation within DMN and WM networks was maximal 
      during the most demanding n-back condition (3-back). Furthermore, individuals 
      showing a stronger negative correlation between the two networks under both 
      conditions exhibited better behavioural performance. Interestingly, and despite the 
      fact that we considered eight different resting-state fMRI networks previously 
      identified in humans, only the connectivity within the posteromedial parts of the 
      DMN (precuneus) prior to the fMRI n-back task predicted WM execution. Our results 
      using a data-driven probabilistic approach for fMRI analysis provide the first 
      evidence of a direct relationship between behavioural performance and the degree of 
      negative correlation between the DMN and WM networks. They further suggest that in 
      the context of expectancy for an imminent cognitive challenge, higher resting-state 
      activity in the posteromedial parietal cortex may be related to increased 
      attentional preparatory resources.

TI  - Frontal and parietal activity after sleep deprivation is dependent on task 
      difficulty and can be predicted by the fMRI response after normal sleep.
PG  - 62-70
LID - 10.1016/j.bbr.2012.04.050 [doi]
AB  - Sleep disturbance in neurological and psychiatric disorders is common and associated 
      with diminished cognitive functioning. Whilst these deficits can be localised 
      predominantly to frontal and parietal regions, there have been reported 
      inconsistencies which may be due to differences in the difficulty and type of task. 
      In the present study we examined the effects of sleep deprivation (SD) whilst 
      parametrically varying working memory load using an n-back task. 20 right-handed 
      males performed the n-back task after a night of normal sleep (RW: rested 
      wakefulness) and after approximately 31 h of SD. Comparison of load responsive 
      cerebral activation identified two clusters where the parametric response was 
      altered after SD. In the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activity was reduced 
      at the most difficult working memory load, whereas in the right inferior parietal 
      lobe activity was increased at the simplest working memory load. The strength of 
      activation in both of these regions during RW predicted the response of those same 
      regions to SD. While the ability to predict signal change has previously been 
      demonstrated using behavioural measures, to our knowledge this is the first study to 
      show that the neuronal effects of SD can be predicted based upon activation during a 
      normal rested condition.

TI  - Persistent differences in patterns of brain activation after sports-related 
      concussion: a longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging study.
PG  - 180-8
LID - 10.1089/neu.2013.2983 [doi]
AB  - Avoiding recurrent injury in sports-related concussion (SRC) requires understanding 
      the neural mechanisms involved during the time of recovery after injury. The 
      decision for return-to-play is one of the most difficult responsibilities facing the 
      physician, and so far this decision has been based primarily on neurological 
      examination, symptom checklists, and neuropsychological (NP) testing. Functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may be an additional, more objective tool to 
      assess the severity and recovery of function after concussion. The purpose of this 
      study was to define neural correlates of SRC during the 2 months after injury in 
      varsity contact sport athletes who suffered a SRC. All athletes were scanned as they 
      performed an n-back task, for n=1, 2, 3. Subjects were scanned within 72 hours 
      (session one), at 2 weeks (session two), and 2 months (session three) post-injury. 
      Compared with age and sex matched normal controls, concussed subjects demonstrated 
      persistent, significantly increased activation for the 2 minus 1 n-back contrast in 
      bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in all three sessions and in the 
      inferior parietal lobe in session one and two (α≤0.01 corrected). Measures of task 
      performance revealed no significant differences between concussed versus control 
      groups at any of the three time points with respect to any of the three n-back 
      tasks. These findings suggest that functional brain activation differences persist 
      at 2 months after injury in concussed athletes, despite the fact that their 
      performance on a standard working memory task is comparable to normal controls and 
      normalization of clinical and NP test results. These results might indicate a delay 
      between neural and behaviorally assessed recovery after SRC.

TI  - fMRI applications in schizophrenia research.
PG  - S118-26
AB  - fMRI has unique potential in the study of psychiatric patients, particularly in 
      characterizing individual variations and changes over time. We have performed four 
      studies of patients with schizophrenia, using three different fMRI acquisition 
      protocols: (1) 3-D echo-shifted FLASH, a multishot volumetric approach; (2) 3-D 
      PRESTO, a hybid of multishot and echo-planar imaging (EPI) methods that also 
      acquires true volumetric data; and (3) a whole-brain isotropic, multislice EPI 
      technique. Patients were studied during sensorimotor activation and during a novel 
      "N back" working memory paradigm. In general, patients show normal sensorimotor 
      activation responses, although motor cortical activation tends to be less completely 
      lateralized. Prefrontal activation during working memory tends to be reduced in 
      patients with schizophrenia even when performance is normal. A major potential 
      confound in studying this patient population with fMRI is the effect of motion. We 
      propose several methodological standards to address this problem, including 
      comparisons of motion corrections parameters, voxel variances, and the use of an 
      "internal activation standard."

TI  - Is a Responsive Default Mode Network Required for Successful Working Memory Task 
      Performance?
PG  - 11595-605
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0264-15.2015 [doi]
AB  - In studies of cognitive processing using tasks with externally directed attention, 
      regions showing increased (external-task-positive) and decreased or "negative" 
      [default-mode network (DMN)] fMRI responses during task performance are dynamically 
      responsive to increasing task difficulty. Responsiveness (modulation of fMRI signal 
      by increasing load) has been linked directly to successful cognitive task 
      performance in external-task-positive regions but not in DMN regions. To investigate 
      whether a responsive DMN is required for successful cognitive performance, we 
      compared healthy human subjects (n = 23) with individuals shown to have decreased 
      DMN engagement (chronic pain patients, n = 28). Subjects performed a multilevel 
      working-memory task (N-back) during fMRI. If a responsive DMN is required for 
      successful performance, patients having reduced DMN responsiveness should show 
      worsened performance; if performance is not reduced, their brains should show 
      compensatory activation in external-task-positive regions or elsewhere. All subjects 
      showed decreased accuracy and increased reaction times with increasing task level, 
      with no significant group differences on either measure at any level. Patients had 
      significantly reduced negative fMRI response (deactivation) of DMN regions 
      (posterior cingulate/precuneus, medial prefrontal cortex). Controls showed expected 
      modulation of DMN deactivation with increasing task difficulty. Patients showed 
      significantly reduced modulation of DMN deactivation by task difficulty, despite 
      their successful task performance. We found no evidence of compensatory neural 
      recruitment in external-task-positive regions or elsewhere. Individual 
      responsiveness of the external-task-positive ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, but 
      not of DMN regions, correlated with task accuracy. These findings suggest that a 
      responsive DMN may not be required for successful cognitive performance; a 
      responsive external-task-positive network may be sufficient. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: 
      We studied the relationship between responsiveness of the brain to increasing task 
      demand and successful cognitive performance, using chronic pain patients as a probe. 
      fMRI working memory studies show that two main cognitive networks ["external-task 
      positive" and "default-mode network" (DMN)] are responsive to increasing task 
      difficulty. The responsiveness of both of these brain networks is suggested to be 
      required for successful task performance. The responsiveness of 
      external-task-positive regions has been linked directly to successful cognitive task 
      performance, as we also show here. However, pain patients show decreased engagement 
      and responsiveness of the DMN but can perform a working memory task as well as 
      healthy subjects, without demonstrable compensatory neural recruitment. Therefore, a 
      responsive DMN might not be needed for successful cognitive performance.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Children with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) exhibit executive dysfunction 
      on traditional neuropsychological tests. There is limited evidence of different 
      functional network alterations associated with this clinical executive dysfunction. 
      This study investigates working memory deficits in children with TLE by assessing 
      deactivation of the default mode network (DMN) on functional Magnetic Resonance 
      Imaging (fMRI) and the relationship of DMN deactivation with fMRI behavioral 
      findings and neuropsychological test performance. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: fMRI was 
      conducted on 15 children with TLE and 15 healthy controls (age: 8-16 years) while 
      performing the N-back task in order to assess deactivation of the DMN. N-back 
      accuracy, N-back reaction time, and neuropsychological tests of executive function 
      (Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System [D-KEFS] Color-Word Interference and Card 
      Sort tests) were also assessed. PRINCIPAL OBSERVATIONS: During the N-back task, 
      children with TLE exhibited significantly less deactivation of the DMN, primarily in 
      the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex compared with controls. These alterations 
      significantly correlated with N-back behavioral findings and D-KEFS results. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Children with TLE exhibit executive dysfunction which correlates with 
      DMN alterations. These findings suggest that the level of deactivation of specific 
      functional networks may contribute to cognitive impairment in children with TLE. The 
      findings also indicate that children with TLE have network alterations in 
      extratemporal lobe brain regions.

AB  - Experimental animal work has demonstrated that dopamine and noradrenaline play an 
      essential role in modulating prefrontal cortex-mediated networks underlying working 
      memory performance. Studies of functional connectivity have been instrumental in 
      extending such notions to humans but, so far, have almost exclusively focussed on 
      pharmacological agents with a predominant dopaminergic mechanism of action. Here, we 
      investigate the effect of a single dose of atomoxetine 60mg, a noradrenaline 
      transporter inhibitor, on working memory performance and associated functional 
      connectivity during an n-back task in 19 healthy male volunteers. Atomoxetine 
      increased functional connectivity between right anterior insula and dorsolateral 
      prefrontal cortex, precentral gyrus, posterior parietal cortex and precuneus during 
      the high-working memory load condition of the n-back task. Increased 
      atomoxetine-induced insula-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex functional connectivity 
      during this condition correlated with decreased reaction time variability and was 
      furthermore predicted by working memory capacity. These results show for the first 
      time that noradrenaline transporter blockade-induced increases in cortical 
      catecholamines accentuate fronto-parietal working memory-related network integrity. 
      The observation of significant inter-subject variability in response to atomoxetine 
      has implications for inverted-U frameworks of dopamine and noradrenaline function, 
      which could be useful to predict drug effects in clinical disorders with variable 
      treatment response.

TI  - Dissociation of cortical regions modulated by both working memory load and sleep 
      deprivation and by sleep deprivation alone.
PG  - 579-87
AB  - Working memory is an important mental capacity that is compromised following sleep 
      deprivation (SD). To understand how working memory load interacts with state to 
      influence brain activation in load-sensitive regions, and the extent to which 
      SD-related changes are common across different loads, we used fMRI to study twelve 
      healthy subjects following 24 h of SD using a verbal n-back task with three load 
      levels. Performance decline was observed by way of reduced accuracy and slower 
      response times following SD. The left prefrontal region and thalamus showed load 
      dependent activity modulation that interacted with state. The right parietal and 
      anterior medial frontal regions showed load dependent changes in activity as well as 
      an effect of state. The anterior cingulate and occipital regions showed activation 
      that displayed state effects that were independent of working memory load. These 
      findings represent a step toward identifying how different brain regions exhibit 
      varying vulnerability to the deleterious effects of SD on working memory.

TI  - Neural activation patterns during working memory tasks and OSA disease severity: 
      preliminary findings.
PG  - 21-7
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with cognitive 
      impairments in working memory (WM). Neuronal activation during WM tasks can be 
      indirectly assessed by blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (BOLD-fMRI). The purpose of this study was to describe BOLD-fMRI responses 
      during 2 separate working memory tasks and a finger tapping task in men with OSA. A 
      secondary aim was to explore the possible relation between OSA severity 
      (apnea/hypopnea index) and BOLD-fMRI signal patterns. METHODS: Nine treatment-naïve 
      men (mean age [+/- SD] of 45.7 [+/- 6.6] years) with OSA underwent BOLD fMRI testing 
      on a research-dedicated university-based MRI scanner. During BOLD-fMRI subjects 
      performed a Paced Auditory Serial Addition task (PASAT), an auditory N-Back task 
      (2-BACK) task, and an alternating finger tapping. RESULTS: PASAT and 2-BACK tasks 
      produced similar patterns of increased bilateral activation in posterior parietal, 
      prefrontal and cerebellar regions. BOLD signal deactivations were observed within 
      posterior cingulate, retrosplenial and inferior frontal regions during PASAT and 
      2-BACK, but not during tapping. With increased disease severity, BOLD activation 
      patterns were increased in the right parietal lobe, but decreased in the cerebellar 
      vermis. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings suggest that the severity of OSA may 
      correlate with neural activation during tasks of working memory, potentially 
      reflecting compensatory neural responses in severe disease.

AB  - Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), regarded as the prodromal stage before the clinical 
      phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD), has been considered for early intervention. 
      Unfortunately, many trials in this stage with drugs with single-target turned out to 
      be little or no effect. Multi-targeting in nature based on the theory of Traditional 
      Chinese Medicine (TCM) offers another prospect for intervention. Together with 
      advanced functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique for more sensitive 
      and objective evaluation, we investigated the long-term therapeutic effects of a TCM 
      compound on cognition and task-related neuronal activity. Sixty amnestic MCI (aMCI) 
      participants from randomly divided into drug (30 with Bushen capsules (BSC)) and 
      placebo (30 with placebo capsules) groups for this 2-years trial. Neuropsychological 
      and N-back task-fMRI data were acquired at baseline and two follow-ups to assess, 
      via linear mixed effect models, the changes of cognitive ability and brain 
      activation over treatments. The drug group, compared with placebo group, exhibited 
      improvement or stabilization in memory measures over time. Analyses of fMRI revealed 
      that the placebo group exhibited higher activation magnitude and spatial extents at 
      left superior parietal lobule; importantly, the greater activation identified in 
      placebo group was related to more decline in the digit span. BSC showed long-term 
      ameliorative effects on cognitive performances in aMCI patients, which might result 
      from the regulation of abnormal brain activities. Our study provided evidence for 
      the potential of TCM in early prevention of AD, as well as the feasibility of 
      neuroimaging biomarkers in clinical trials.

TI  - An fMRI study of working memory for schematic facial expressions.
PG  - 81-6
AB  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine neuronal activation 
      in relation to increasing working memory load in an n-back task, using schematic 
      drawings of facial expressions and scrambled drawings of the same facial features as 
      stimuli. The main objective was to investigate whether working memory for drawings 
      of facial features would yield specific activations compared to memory for scrambled 
      drawings based on the same visual features as those making up the face drawings. 
      fMRI-BOLD responses were acquired with a 1.5 T Siemens MR scanner while subjects 
      watched the facial drawings alternated with the scrambled drawings, in a 
      block-design. Subjects had to hold either 1 or 2 items in working memory. We found 
      that the main effect of increasing memory load from one to two items yielded 
      significant activations in a bilaterally distributed cortical network consisting of 
      regions in the occipitotemporal cortex, the inferior parietal lobule, the 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area and the cerebellum. In 
      addition, we found a memory load x drawings interaction in the right inferior 
      frontal gyrus in favor of the facial drawings. These findings show that working 
      memory is specific for facial features which interact with a general cognitive load 
      component to produce significant activations in prefrontal regions of the brain.

AB  - Neuroimaging studies of cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) treatment in Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) indicate that the short and long term actions of ChEIs are dissimilar. 
      fMRI studies of the ChEI rivastigmine have focused on its short term action. In this 
      exploratory study the effect of prolonged (20 weeks) rivastigmine treatment on 
      regional brain activity was measured with fMRI in patients with mild AD. Eleven 
      patients with probable AD and nine age-matched controls were assessed with a 
      Pyramids and Palm Trees semantic association and an n-back working memory fMRI 
      paradigm. In the patient group only, the assessment was repeated after 20 weeks of 
      treatment. There was an increase in task-related brain activity after treatment with 
      activations more like those of normal healthy elderly. Behaviorally, however, there 
      were no significant differences between baseline and retest scores, with a range of 
      performance probably reflecting variation in drug efficacy across patients. Variable 
      patient response and drug dynamic/kinetic factors in small patient groups will 
      inevitably bias (either way) the effect size of any relevant drug related changes in 
      activation. Future studies should take drug response into account to provide more 
      insight into the benefits of ChEI drugs at the individual level.

AB  - People with depression have shown alterations in processing emotional information 
      and working memory functionality. There is some evidence that emotional content may 
      interact with working memory update processes, however neurological correlates are 
      current unknown. In this preliminary study we utilized a novel version of the 
      emotional variant of the n-back working memory task in fMRI. We examined BOLD 
      response of 14 healthy controls and 13 depressed participants in response to happy, 
      sad, and neutral displays of facial affect. No accuracy or reaction time differences 
      were found between the two groups. The depressed group showed significantly 
      decreased BOLD response to happy faces compared to the control group areas of the 
      dorsal striatum and anterior cingulate. Significant, moderate, positive associations 
      were found between right caudate activation with anxiety score and anterior 
      cingulate activation with depression score in those with depression. Our novel task 
      was able to elicit group level differences in emotional processing during working 
      memory update. These results suggest those with depression fail to differentiate 
      between positive emotional stimuli and stimuli with no emotional content.

AB  - Alteration of dynamic range of modulation to cognitive difficulty has been proposed 
      as a salient predictor of cognitive aging. Here, we examine in 171 adults (aged 
      20-94 years) the effects of age on dynamic modulation of blood oxygenation-level 
      dependent activation to difficulty in parametrically increasing working memory (WM) 
      load (0-, 2-, 3-, and 4-back conditions). First, we examined parametric increases 
      and decreases in activation to increasing WM load (positive modulation effect and 
      negative modulation effect). Second, we examined the effect of age on modulation to 
      difficulty (WM load) to identify regions that differed with age as difficulty 
      increased (age-related positive and negative modulation effects). Weakened 
      modulation to difficulty with age was found in both the positive modulation (middle 
      frontal, superior/inferior parietal) and negative modulation effect (deactivated) 
      regions (insula, cingulate, medial superior frontal, fusiform, and parahippocampal 
      gyri, hippocampus, and lateral occipital cortex). Age-related alterations to 
      positive modulation emerged later in the lifespan than negative modulation. 
      Furthermore, these effects were significantly coupled in that greater upmodulation 
      was associated with lesser downmodulation. Importantly, greater fronto-parietal 
      upmodulation to difficulty and greater downmodulation of deactivated regions were 
      associated with better task accuracy and upmodulation with better WM span measured 
      outside the scanner. These findings suggest that greater dynamic range of modulation 
      of activation to cognitive challenge is in service of current task performance, as 
      well as generalizing to cognitive ability beyond the scanner task, lending support 
      to its utility as a marker of successful cognitive aging.

TI  - Neural Basis of Working Memory Enhancement after Acute Aerobic Exercise: fMRI Study 
      of Preadolescent Children.
PG  - 1804
LID - 1804
AB  - Working memory lies at the core of cognitive function and plays a crucial role in 
      children's learning, reasoning, problem solving, and intellectual activity. 
      Behavioral findings have suggested that acute aerobic exercise improves children's 
      working memory; however, there is still very little knowledge about whether a single 
      session of aerobic exercise can alter working memory's brain activation patterns, as 
      assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Therefore, we investigated 
      the effect of acute moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on working memory and its 
      brain activation patterns in preadolescent children, and further explored the neural 
      basis of acute aerobic exercise on working memory in these children. We used a 
      within-subjects design with a counterbalanced order. Nine healthy, right-handed 
      children were scanned with a Siemens MAGNETOM Trio 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance 
      imaging scanner while they performed a working memory task (N-back task), following 
      a baseline session and a 30-min, moderate-intensity exercise session. Compared with 
      the baseline session, acute moderate-intensity aerobic exercise benefitted 
      performance in the N-back task, increasing brain activities of bilateral parietal 
      cortices, left hippocampus, and the bilateral cerebellum. These data extend the 
      current knowledge by indicating that acute aerobic exercise enhances children's 
      working memory, and the neural basis may be related to changes in the working 
      memory's brain activation patterns elicited by acute aerobic exercise.

PG  - 1804-15
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.10.074 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we elucidate the changes in neural oscillatory processes that are 
      induced by simple working memory tasks. A group of eight subjects took part in 
      modified versions of the N-back and Sternberg working memory paradigms. 
      Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data were recorded, and subsequently processed using 
      beamformer based source imaging methodology. Our study shows statistically 
      significant increases in θ oscillations during both N-back and Sternberg tasks. 
      These oscillations were shown to originate in the medial frontal cortex, and further 
      to scale with memory load. We have also shown that increases in θ oscillations are 
      accompanied by decreases in β and γ band oscillations at the same spatial 
      coordinate. These decreases were most prominent in the 20-40 Hz frequency range, 
      although spectral analysis showed that γ band power decrease extends up to at least 
      80 Hz. β/γ Power decrease also scales with memory load. Whilst θ increases were 
      predominately observed in the medial frontal cortex, β/γ decreases were associated 
      with other brain areas, including nodes of the default mode network (for the N-back 
      task) and areas associated with language processing (for the Sternberg task). These 
      observations are in agreement with intracranial EEG and fMRI studies. Finally, we 
      have shown an intimate relationship between changes in β/γ band oscillatory power at 
      spatially separate network nodes, implying that activity in these nodes is not 
      reflective of uni-modal task driven changes in spatially separate brain regions, but 
      rather represents correlated network activity. The utility of MEG as a non-invasive 
      means to measure neural oscillatory modulation has been demonstrated and future 
      studies employing this technology have the potential to gain a better understanding 
      of neural oscillatory processes, their relationship to functional and effective 
      connectivity, and their correspondence to BOLD fMRI.

TI  - Comparison of fMRI motion correction software tools.
PG  - 529-43
AB  - Motion correction of fMRI data is a widely used step prior to data analysis. In this 
      study, a comparison of the motion correction tools provided by several leading fMRI 
      analysis software packages was performed, including AFNI, AIR, BrainVoyager, FSL, 
      and SPM2. Comparisons were performed using data from typical human studies as well 
      as phantom data. The identical reconstruction, preprocessing, and analysis steps 
      were used on every data set, except that motion correction was performed using 
      various configurations from each software package. Each package was studied using 
      default parameters, as well as parameters optimized for speed and accuracy. Forty 
      subjects performed a Go/No-go task (an event-related design that investigates 
      inhibitory motor response) and an N-back task (a block-design paradigm investigating 
      working memory). The human data were analyzed by extracting a set of general linear 
      model (GLM)-derived activation results and comparing the effect of motion correction 
      on thresholded activation cluster size and maximum t value. In addition, a series of 
      simulated phantom data sets were created with known activation locations, 
      magnitudes, and realistic motion. Results from the phantom data indicate that AFNI 
      and SPM2 yield the most accurate motion estimation parameters, while AFNI's 
      interpolation algorithm introduces the least smoothing. AFNI is also the fastest of 
      the packages tested. However, these advantages did not produce noticeably better 
      activation results in motion-corrected data from typical human fMRI experiments. 
      Although differences in performance between packages were apparent in the human 
      data, no single software package produced dramatically better results than the 
      others. The "accurate" parameters showed virtually no improvement in cluster t 
      values compared to the standard parameters. While the "fast" parameters did not 
      result in a substantial increase in speed, they did not degrade the cluster results 
      very much either. The phantom and human data indicate that motion correction can be 
      a valuable step in the data processing chain, yielding improvements of up to 20% in 
      the magnitude and up to 100% in the cluster size of detected activations, but the 
      choice of software package does not substantially affect this improvement.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess possible effects of working memory (WM) training on cognitive 
      functionality, functional MRI and brain connectivity in patients with juvenile MS. 
      METHODS: Cognitive status, fMRI and inter-network connectivity were assessed in 5 
      cases with juvenile MS aged between 12 and 18 years. Afterwards they received a 
      computerized WM training for four weeks. Primary cognitive outcome measures were WM 
      (visual and verbal) and alertness. Activation patterns related to WM were assessed 
      during fMRI using an N-Back task with increasing difficulty. Inter-network 
      connectivity analyses were focused on fronto-parietal (left and right), default-mode 
      (dorsal and ventral) and the anterior salience network. Cognitive functioning, fMRI 
      and inter-network connectivity were reassessed directly after the training and again 
      nine months following training. RESULTS: Response to treatment was seen in two 
      patients. These patients showed increased performance in WM and alertness after the 
      training. These behavioural changes were accompanied by increased WM network 
      activation and systematic changes in inter-network connectivity. The remaining 
      participants were non-responders to treatment. Effects on cognitive performance were 
      maintained up to nine months after training, whereas effects observed by fMRI 
      disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: Responders revealed training effects on all applied 
      outcome measures. Disease activity and general intelligence may be factors 
      associated with response to treatment.

AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the association between burnout 
      and neural activation during working memory processing in patients with 
      stress-related exhaustion. Additionally, we investigated the neural effects of 
      cognitive training as part of stress rehabilitation. Fifty-five patients with 
      clinical diagnosis of exhaustion disorder were administered the n-back task during 
      fMRI scanning at baseline. Ten patients completed a 12-week cognitive training 
      intervention, as an addition to stress rehabilitation. Eleven patients served as a 
      treatment-as-usual control group. At baseline, burnout level was positively 
      associated with neural activation in the rostral prefrontal cortex, the posterior 
      parietal cortex and the striatum, primarily in the 2-back condition. Following 
      stress rehabilitation, the striatal activity decreased as a function of improved 
      levels of burnout. No significant association between burnout level and working 
      memory performance was found, however, our findings indicate that frontostriatal 
      neural responses related to working memory were modulated by burnout severity. We 
      suggest that patients with high levels of burnout need to recruit additional 
      cognitive resources to uphold task performance. Following cognitive training, 
      increased neural activation was observed during 3-back in working memory-related 
      regions, including the striatum, however, low sample size limits any firm 
      conclusions.

TI  - Nicotine effects on brain function and functional connectivity in schizophrenia.
PG  - 850-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nicotine in tobacco smoke can improve functioning in multiple cognitive 
      domains. High rates of smoking among schizophrenic patients may reflect an effort to 
      remediate cognitive dysfunction. Our primary aim was to determine whether nicotine 
      improves cognitive function by facilitating activation of brain regions mediating 
      task performance or by facilitating functional connectivity. METHODS: Thirteen 
      smokers with schizophrenia and 13 smokers with no mental illness were withdrawn from 
      tobacco and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning twice, 
      once after placement of a placebo patch and once after placement of a nicotine 
      patch. During scanning, subjects performed an n-back task with two levels of working 
      memory load and of selective attention load. RESULTS: During the most difficult 
      (dichotic 2-back) task condition, nicotine improved performance of schizophrenic 
      subjects and worsened performance of control subjects. Nicotine also enhanced 
      activation of a network of regions, including anterior cingulate cortex and 
      bilateral thalamus, and modulated thalamocortical functional connectivity to a 
      greater degree in schizophrenic than in control subjects during dichotic 2-back task 
      performance. CONCLUSIONS: In tasks that tax working memory and selective attention, 
      nicotine may improve performance in schizophrenia patients by enhancing activation 
      of and functional connectivity between brain regions that mediate task performance.

      cause sampling bias?
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22150 [doi]
AB  - Head movement during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) degrades data 
      quality. The effects of small movements can be ameliorated during data 
      postprocessing, but data associated with severe movement is frequently discarded. In 
      discarding these data, it is often assumed that head-movement is a source of random 
      error, and that data can be discarded from subjects with severe movement without 
      biasing the sample. We tested this assumption by examining whether head movement was 
      related to task difficulty and cognitive status among persons with multiple 
      sclerosis (MS). Thirty-four persons with MS were scanned while performing a working 
      memory task with three levels of difficulty (the N-back task). Maximum movement 
      (angle, shift) was estimated for each difficulty level. Cognitive status was 
      assessed by combining performance on a working memory and processing speed task. An 
      interaction was found between task difficulty and cognitive status (high vs. low 
      cognitive ability): there was a linear increase in movement as task difficulty 
      increased that was larger among subjects with lower cognitive ability. Analyses of 
      the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) confirmed that increases in movement degraded data 
      quality. Similar, though far smaller, effects were found in a cohort of healthy 
      control (HC) subjects. Therefore, discarding data with severe movement artifact may 
      bias MS samples such that only those with less-severe cognitive impairment are 
      included in the analyses. However, even if such data are not discarded outright, 
      subjects who move more (MS and HC) will contribute less to the group-level results 
      because of degraded SNR.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cognitive impairment in the euthymic phase is a well-established 
      finding in bipolar disorder. However, its brain structural and/or functional 
      correlates are uncertain. METHODS: Thirty-three euthymic bipolar patients with 
      preserved memory and executive function and 28 euthymic bipolar patients with 
      significant memory and/or executive impairment, as defined using two test batteries, 
      the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT) and the Behavioural Assessment of the 
      Dysexecutive Syndrome (BADS), plus 28 healthy controls underwent structural MRI 
      using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Twenty-seven of the cognitively preserved 
      patients, 23 of the cognitively impaired patients and 28 controls also underwent 
      fMRI during performance of the n-back working memory task. RESULTS: No clusters of 
      grey or white matter volume difference were found between the two patient groups. 
      During n-back performance, the cognitively impaired patients showed hypoactivation 
      compared to the cognitively preserved patients in a circumscribed region in the 
      right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Both patient groups showed failure of 
      de-activation in the medial frontal cortex compared to the healthy controls. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairment in euthymic bipolar patients appears from this 
      study to be unrelated to structural brain abnormality, but there was some evidence 
      for an association with altered prefrontal function.

AB  - PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Investigation of the impact of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on 
      the functional brain network that mediates working memory function. RESEARCH DESIGN: 
      Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an n-back working memory task in 
      nine chronic-stage patients with TBI and nine age-matched healthy controls. In 
      addition to classical analyses investigating regional activity, the authors examined 
      functional connectivity of the brain regions critical to working memory performance 
      using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses. MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: 
      Patients with TBI made a greater percentage of errors than controls at high working 
      memory load conditions. The fMRI data showed that the activation of the left 
      inferior parietal gyrus (LIPG) was significantly reduced, whereas the activation of 
      the right inferior frontal gyrus (RIFG) was significantly increased in patients 
      compared with controls. Task performance accuracy was significantly associated with 
      the activation of the LIPG in controls and the activation of the RIFG in patients. 
      PPI analyses on fMRI data further suggested that the functional connectivity between 
      the RIFG and LIPG was compromised in patients. CONCLUSION: The abnormal functional 
      connectivity between LIPG and RIFG may underlie the observed working memory deficits 
      and abnormal brain activation pattern in patients.

TI  - First-episode psychosis is characterized by failure of deactivation but not by hypo- 
      or hyperfrontality.
PG  - 73-84
LID - 10.1017/S0033291711001073 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is not known whether first-episode psychosis is characterized by the 
      same prefrontal cortex functional imaging abnormalities as chronic schizophrenia. 
      METHOD: Thirty patients with a first episode of non-affective functional psychosis 
      and 28 healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
      during performance of the n-back working memory task. Voxel-based analyses of brain 
      activations and deactivations were carried out and compared between groups. The 
      connectivity of regions of significant difference between the patients and controls 
      was also examined. RESULTS: The first-episode patients did not show significant 
      prefrontal hypo- or hyperactivation compared to controls. However, they showed 
      failure of deactivation in the medial frontal cortex. This area showed high levels 
      of connectivity with the posterior cingulate gyrus/precuneus and parts of the 
      parietal cortex bilaterally. Failure of deactivation was significantly greater in 
      first-episode patients who had or went on to acquire a DSM-IV diagnosis of 
      schizophrenia than in those who did not, and in those who met RDC criteria for 
      schizophrenia compared to those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: First-episode psychosis is 
      not characterized by hypo- or hyperfrontality but instead by a failure of 
      deactivation in the medial frontal cortex. The location and connectivity of this 
      area suggest that it is part of the default mode network. The failure of 
      deactivation seems to be particularly marked in first-episode patients who have, or 
      progress to, schizophrenia.

TI  - Genetic liability for bipolar disorder is characterized by excess frontal activation 
      in response to a working memory task.
PG  - 513-20
LID - 10.1016/j.biopsych.2008.04.038 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is evidence that patients with bipolar disorder have working 
      memory deficits even during periods of euthymia. The neural basis of such deficits 
      and its relationship with genetic risk remain unclear. We utilized functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural activity in samples of 
      bipolar disorder patients and their unaffected first-degree relatives while 
      performing working memory tasks of increasing difficulty. METHODS: Twenty remitted 
      bipolar I disorder patients, 20 of their unaffected first-degree relatives, and 20 
      healthy volunteers were recruited and successfully completed scanning. Subjects 
      participated in fMRI scans consisting of an n-back working memory task with three 
      stages of increasing difficulty (1-back, 2-back, and 3-back), alternating with a 
      baseline attention task. Groups were analyzed separately to produce brain activation 
      maps, and a group-by-task analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc comparisons was 
      completed. RESULTS: Patients performed more poorly online than control subjects and 
      relatives on the 2-back and 3-back tasks. The group-by-task ANOVA demonstrated a 
      significantly altered region of neural activity involving a cluster located in the 
      left frontal pole/ventrolateral gyrus. Post hoc analyses demonstrated that this 
      cluster was accounted for by significantly greater activation in relatives compared 
      with control subjects for the 2-back task. Patients demonstrated a trend to 
      significantly greater activation than control subjects in the same cluster during 
      1-back performance. CONCLUSIONS: Left prefrontal hyperactivation during working 
      memory is associated with genetic liability for bipolar disorder and represents a 
      potential neurobiological endophenotype for the illness.

LID - 10.1016/j.mri.2009.01.007 [doi]
AB  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) 
      represent brain activity in terms of a reliable anatomical localization and a 
      detailed temporal evolution of neural signals. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings 
      offer the possibility to greatly enrich the significance and the interpretation of 
      the single modality results because the same neural processes are observed from the 
      same brain at the same time. Nonetheless, the different physical nature of the 
      measured signals by the two techniques renders the coupling not always 
      straightforward, especially in cognitive experiments where spatially localized and 
      distributed effects coexist and evolve temporally at different temporal scales. The 
      purpose of this article is to illustrate the combination of simultaneously recorded 
      EEG and fMRI signals exploiting the principles of EEG distributed source modeling. 
      We define a common source space for fMRI and EEG signal projection and gather a 
      conceptually unique framework for the spatial and temporal comparative analysis. We 
      illustrate this framework in a graded-load working-memory simultaneous EEG-fMRI 
      experiment based on the n-back task where sustained load-dependent changes in the 
      blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signals during continuous item memorization 
      co-occur with parametric changes in the EEG theta power induced at each single item. 
      In line with previous studies, we demonstrate on two single-subject cases how the 
      presented approach is capable of colocalizing in midline frontal regions two 
      phenomena simultaneously observed at different temporal scales, such as the 
      sustained negative changes in BOLD activity and the parametric EEG theta 
      synchronization. We discuss the presented approach in relation to modeling and 
      interpretation issues typically arising in simultaneous EEG-fMRI studies.

TI  - Source analysis of event-related potentials during pitch discrimination and pitch 
      memory tasks.
PG  - 445-58
LID - 10.1007/s10548-013-0307-9 [doi]
AB  - Our previous studies using fMRI have demonstrated that activations in human auditory 
      cortex (AC) are strongly dependent on the characteristics of the task. The present 
      study tested whether source estimation of scalp-recorded event-related potentials 
      (ERPs) can be used to investigate task-dependent AC activations. Subjects were 
      presented with frequency-varying two-part tones during pitch discrimination, pitch 
      n-back memory, and visual tasks identical to our previous fMRI study (Rinne et al., 
      J Neurosci 29:13338-13343, 2009). ERPs and their minimum-norm source estimates in AC 
      were strongly modulated by task at 200-700 ms from tone onset. As in the fMRI study, 
      the pitch discrimination and pitch memory tasks were associated with distinct AC 
      activation patterns. In the pitch discrimination task, increased activity in the 
      anterior AC was detected relatively late at 300-700 ms from tone onset. Therefore, 
      this activity was probably not associated with enhanced pitch processing but rather 
      with the actual discrimination process (comparison between the two parts of tone). 
      Increased activity in more posterior areas associated with the pitch memory task, in 
      turn, occurred at 200-700 ms suggesting that this activity was related to operations 
      on pitch categories after pitch analysis was completed. Finally, decreased activity 
      associated with the pitch memory task occurred at 150-300 ms consistent with the 
      notion that, in the demanding pitch memory task, spectrotemporal analysis is 
      actively halted as soon as category information has been obtained. These results 
      demonstrate that ERP source analysis can be used to complement fMRI to investigate 
      task-dependent activations of human AC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Subtle deficits in executive functioning are present in patients with 
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and their first-degree relatives, suggesting 
      involvement of the frontoparietal circuits. The neural correlates of working memory 
      may be a neurocognitive endophenotype of OCD. METHODS: Forty-three unmedicated OCD 
      patients, 17 unaffected siblings, and 37 matched comparison subjects performed a 
      visuospatial n-back task, with a baseline condition (N0) and three working memory 
      load levels (N1, N2, N3) during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Task-related 
      brain activity was compared between groups in frontoparietal regions of interest. 
      Generalized psychophysiological interaction analyses were used to study task-related 
      changes in functional connectivity. RESULTS: Obsessive-compulsive disorder patients, 
      compared with comparison subjects and siblings, showed increased error rates at N3. 
      Compared with comparison subjects, OCD patients showed task-related hyperactivation 
      in left dorsal frontal areas and left precuneus associated with better task 
      performance. Siblings exhibited hyperactivation in a bilateral frontoparietal 
      network. Increased task load was associated with increased task-related brain 
      activity, but in OCD patients and siblings this increase was smaller from load N2 to 
      N3 than in comparison subjects. Obsessive-compulsive disorder patients, compared 
      with siblings and comparison subjects, showed increased task-related functional 
      connectivity between frontal regions and bilateral amygdala. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings indicate that compensatory frontoparietal brain activity in OCD patients 
      and their unaffected relatives preserves task performance at low task loads but is 
      insufficient to maintain performance at high task loads. Frontoparietal dysfunction 
      may constitute a neurocognitive endophenotype for OCD, possibly reflecting limbic 
      interference with and neural inefficiency within the frontoparietal network.

TI  - Task positive and default mode networks during a working memory in children with 
      primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis and healthy controls.
PG  - 422-9
LID - 10.1038/pr.2015.120 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nocturnal enuresis is a common developmental disorder in children, and 
      primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (PMNE) is the dominant subtype. METHODS: 
      This study investigated brain functional abnormalities that are specifically related 
      to working memory in children with PMNE using function magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) in combination with an n-back task. Twenty children with PMNE and 20 healthy 
      children, group-matched for age and sex, participated in this experiment. RESULTS: 
      Several brain regions exhibited reduced activation during the n-back task in 
      children with PMNE, including the right precentral gyrus and the right inferior 
      parietal lobule extending to the postcentral gyrus. Children with PMNE exhibited 
      decreased cerebral activation in the task-positive network, increased task-related 
      cerebral deactivation during a working memory task, and longer response times. 
      CONCLUSION: Patients exhibited different brain response patterns to different levels 
      of working memory and tended to compensate by greater default mode network 
      deactivation to sustain normal working memory function. Our results suggest that 
      children with PMNE have potential working memory dysfunction.

TI  - Functional connectivity in an fMRI working memory task in high-functioning autism.
PG  - 810-21
AB  - An fMRI study was used to measure the brain activation of a group of adults with 
      high-functioning autism compared to a Full Scale and Verbal IQ and age-matched 
      control group during an n-back working memory task with letters. The behavioral 
      results showed comparable performance, but the fMRI results suggested that the 
      normal controls might use verbal codes to perform the task, while the adults with 
      autism might use visual codes. The control group demonstrated more activation in the 
      left than the right parietal regions, whereas the autism group showed more right 
      lateralized activation in the prefrontal and parietal regions. The autism group also 
      had more activation than the control group in the posterior regions including 
      inferior temporal and occipital regions. The analysis of functional connectivity 
      yielded similar patterns for the two groups with different hemispheric correlations. 
      The temporal profile of the activity in the prefrontal regions was more correlated 
      with the left parietal regions for the control group, whereas it was more correlated 
      with the right parietal regions for the autism group.

TI  - Frontal hypoactivation on functional magnetic resonance imaging in working memory 
      after severe diffuse traumatic brain injury.
PG  - 479-94
LID - 10.1089/neu.2007.0417 [doi]
AB  - Working memory is frequently impaired after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The 
      present study aimed to investigate working memory deficits in patients with diffuse 
      axonal injury and to determine the contribution of cerebral activation dysfunctions 
      to them. Eighteen patients with severe TBI and 14 healthy controls matched for age 
      and gender were included in the study. TBI patients were selected according to signs 
      of diffuse axonal injury on computed tomography (CT) and without any evidence of 
      focal lesions on MRI clinical examination. Functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) was 
      used to assess brain activation during n-back tasks (0-, 2-, and 3-back). Compared 
      to controls, the TBI group showed significant working memory impairment on the 
      Digits Backwards (p=0.022) and Letter-Number Sequencing subtests from the WAIS-III 
      (p<0.001) under the 2-back (p=0.008) and 3-back (p=0.017) conditions. Both groups 
      engaged bilateral fronto-parietal regions known to be involved in working memory, 
      although patients showed less cerebral activation than did controls. Decreased 
      activation in TBI patients compared to controls was observed mainly in the right 
      superior and middle frontal cortex. The correlation patterns differed between 
      patients and controls: while the control group showed a negative correlation between 
      performance and activation in prefrontal cortex (PFC), TBI patients presented a 
      positive correlation in right parietal and left parahippocampus for the low and high 
      working memory load, respectively. In conclusion, severe TBI patients with diffuse 
      brain damage show a pattern of cerebral hypoactivation in the right middle and 
      superior frontal regions during working memory tasks, and also present an impaired 
      pattern of performance correlations.

TI  - Verbal working memory-related functional connectivity alterations in boys with 
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and the effects of methylphenidate.
PG  - 1061-1069
LID - 10.1177/0269881117715607 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Few studies have investigated verbal working memory-related functional 
      connectivity patterns in participants with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
      (ADHD). Thus, we aimed to compare working memory-related functional connectivity 
      patterns in healthy children and those with ADHD, and study effects of 
      methylphenidate (MPH). METHOD: Twenty-two boys with ADHD were scanned twice, under 
      either MPH (single dose, 10 mg) or placebo, in a randomised, cross-over, 
      counterbalanced placebo-controlled design. Thirty healthy boys were scanned once. We 
      used fMRI during a numerical n-back task to examine functional connectivity patterns 
      in case-control and MPH-placebo comparisons, using independent component analysis. 
      RESULTS: There was no significant difference in behavioural performance between 
      children with ADHD, treated with MPH or placebo, and healthy controls. Compared with 
      controls, participants with ADHD under placebo showed increased functional 
      connectivity within fronto-parietal and auditory networks, and decreased functional 
      connectivity within the executive control network. MPH normalized the altered 
      functional connectivity pattern and significantly enhanced functional connectivity 
      within the executive control network, though in non-overlapping areas. CONCLUSION: 
      Our study contributes to the identification of the neural substrates of working 
      memory. Single dose of MPH normalized the altered brain functional connectivity 
      network, but had no enhancing effect on (non-impaired) behavioural performance.

AB  - The APOE ε4 allele increases the risk for sporadic Alzheimer's disease and modifies 
      brain activation patterns of numerous cognitive domains. We assessed cognitively 
      intact older adults with a letter n-back task to determine if previously observed 
      increases in ε4 carriers' working-memory-related brain activation are compensatory 
      such that they serve to maintain working memory function. Using multiple regression 
      models, we identified interactions of APOE variant and age in bilateral hippocampus 
      independently from task performance: ε4 carriers only showed a decrease in 
      activation with increasing age, suggesting high sensitivity of fMRI data for 
      detecting changes in Alzheimer's disease-relevant brain areas before cognitive 
      decline. Moreover, we identified ε4 carriers to show higher activations in 
      task-negative medial and task-positive inferior frontal areas along with better 
      performance under high working memory load relative to non-ε4 carriers. The 
      increased frontal recruitment is compatible with models of neuronal compensation, 
      extends on existing evidence, and suggests that ε4 carriers require additional 
      neuronal resources to successfully perform a demanding working memory task.

TI  - Differences in cortico-striatal-cerebellar activation during working memory in 
      syndromal and nonsyndromal children with prenatal alcohol exposure.
PG  - 1931-45

AB  - Although children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure may exhibit the distinctive 
      facial dysmorphology seen in full or partial fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS/PFAS), many 
      lack that dysmorphology. This study examined the functional organization of working 
      memory in the brain in three groups of children-those meeting diagnostic criteria 
      for FAS or PFAS, heavily exposed (HE) nonsyndromal children, and healthy controls. A 
      verbal n-back task (1-back and 0-back) was administered to 47 children (17 with 
      FAS/PFAS, 13 HE, and 17 controls) during fMRI. Intra-group one-sample t-tests were 
      used to identify activity regions of interest central to verbal working memory 
      including the dorsal prefrontal cortex (dPFC), inferior frontal gyrus, 
      caudate/putamen, parietal cortex, and cerebellar Crus I/lobule VI and lobule 
      VIIB-IX. Whereas groups did not differ in task sensitivity, fMRI analyses suggested 
      different patterns of sub-network recruitment across groups. Controls primarily 
      recruited left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area). By contrast, HE primarily 
      recruited an extensive set of fronto-striatal regions, including left dPFC and left 
      caudate, and the FAS/PFAS group relied primarily on two cerebellar subregions and 
      parietal cortex. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate 
      differential recruitment of critical brain regions that subserve basic function in 
      children with different fetal alcohol spectrum disorders compared to controls. The 
      distinct activation patterns seen in the two exposed groups may be related to 
      substantial differences in alcohol dose/occasion to which these groups were exposed 
      in utero.

AB  - AIM: To assess the working memory and explore the differential activations of brain 
      areas in children with primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE) by performing functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans using the categorical N-Back task. METHODS: 
        Thirteen right-handed PNE children (M/F = 7:6, average age 11.4 ± 0.8 years) and 
      15 age-matched, right-handed, healthy controls (M/F = 9:6, 11.3 ± 1.0 years) were 
      recruited for the study. First, intelligence tests were performed using Chinese 
      Wechsler Young Children Scales of Intelligence in PNE children and controls. The 
      full intelligence quotient (FIQ), verbal IQ (VIQ), performance IQ (PIQ) and 
      memory/caution (M/C) factor were measured. After intelligence tests, event-related 
      fMRI scans were performed using the categorical N-Back working memory task on a 3.0T 
      MR scanner. The percent of correct responses (PCR) and the mean reaction time to 
      correct response (mRT) were recorded and compared; fMRI data were analysed using 
      SPM2, the differences in activation were compared with the single subject and 
      between-group levels. RESULTS: The FIQ, VIQ and PIQ in the PNE group were within the 
      normal range and did not significantly differ from the control group (P > 0.05). The 
      M/C factor was statistically significantly lower in the PNE group (P < 0.05). In the 
      N-Back test, PNE children had lower PCR and longer mRT than controls (P < 0.05). A 
      between-group analysis of fMRI data revealed significant attenuation in the left 
      posterior cerebellar lobes of PNE children. CONCLUSION: PNE children had deficits in 
      working memory, and dysfunction in the left cerebella might be associated with their 
      working memory deficits.

AB  - Schizophrenia (SZ) is a psychotic disorder with significant cognitive dysfunction. 
      Abnormal brain activation during cognitive processing has been reported, both in 
      task-positive and task-negative networks. Further, structural cortical and 
      subcortical brain abnormalities have been documented, but little is known about how 
      task-related brain activation is associated with brain anatomy in SZ compared to 
      healthy controls (HC). Utilizing linked independent component analysis (LICA), a 
      data-driven multimodal analysis approach, we investigated structure-function 
      associations in a large sample of SZ (n = 96) and HC (n = 142). We tested for 
      associations between task-positive (fronto-parietal) and task-negative 
      (default-mode) brain networks derived from fMRI activation during an n-back working 
      memory task, and brain structural measures of surface area, cortical thickness, and 
      gray matter volume, and to what extent these associations differed in SZ compared to 
      HC. A significant association (p < .05, corrected for multiple comparisons) was 
      found between a component reflecting the task-positive fronto-parietal network and 
      another component reflecting cortical thickness in fronto-temporal brain regions in 
      SZ, indicating increased activation with increased thickness. Other 
      structure-function associations across, between and within groups were generally 
      moderate and significant at a nominal p-level only, with more numerous and stronger 
      associations in SZ compared to HC. These results indicate a complex pattern of 
      moderate associations between brain activation during cognitive processing and brain 
      morphometry, and extend previous findings of fronto-temporal brain abnormalities in 
      SZ by suggesting a coupling between cortical thickness of these brain regions and 
      working memory-related brain activation.

AB  - Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a pervasive neurodevelopmental 
      disorder characterized by 3 clusters of age-inappropriate cardinal symptoms: 
      inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. These clinical/behavioural symptoms are 
      assumed to result from disturbances within brain systems supporting executive 
      functions including working memory (WM), which refers to the ability to transiently 
      store and flexibly manipulate task-relevant information. Ongoing or past 
      medications, co-morbidity and differences in task performance are potential, 
      independent confounds in assessing the integrity of cerebral patterns in ADHD. In 
      the present study, we recorded WM-related cerebral activity during a memory updating 
      N-back task using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in control children 
      and never medicated, prepubescent children with ADHD but without comorbid symptoms. 
      Despite similar updating performance than controls, children with ADHD exhibited 
      decreased, below baseline WM-related activation levels in a widespread 
      cortico-subcortical network encompassing bilateral occipital and inferior parietal 
      areas, caudate nucleus, cerebellum and functionally connected brainstem nuclei. 
      Distinctive functional connectivity patterns were also found in the ADHD in these 
      regions, with a tighter coupling in the updating than in the control condition with 
      a distributed WM-related cerebral network. Especially, cerebellum showed tighter 
      coupling with activity in an area compatible with the brainstem red nucleus. These 
      results in children with clinical core symptoms of ADHD but without comorbid 
      affections and never treated with medication yield evidence for a core functional 
      neuroanatomical network subtending WM-related processes in ADHD, which may 
      participate to the pathophysiology and expression of clinical symptoms.

AB  - This case study examined the effects of auditory working memory (WM) training on 
      neuroplastic changes in stroke survivors and how such effects might be influenced by 
      self-perceived stress. Two participants with a history of stroke participated in the 
      study. One of them had a higher level of self-perceived stress. Both participants 
      underwent a course of auditory WM training and completed baseline and post-training 
      assessments such as self-perceived stress, performance satisfaction questionnaires, 
      behavioral task performance, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. They were 
      trained on a computerized auditory WM task (n-back) 5 days a week for 6 weeks, for a 
      total of 20 h. Participant 1 had high levels of perceived stress, both pre- and 
      post-training, and showed improvement on the satisfaction aspect of functional 
      engagement only. Participant 2 had lower levels of perceived stress and demonstrated 
      improvements on all performance tasks. Neuroimaging results showed evidence of 
      improved neural efficiency on the trained task for participant 2. The results shed 
      light on the need to evaluate psychological influences, e.g., stress, when studying 
      the neuroplastic changes in people with stroke. However, the case design approach 
      and other factors that might have positively influenced outcomes mean that these 
      results must be interpreted with a great deal of caution. Future studies using a 
      larger sample are recommended to verify the findings.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disease, frequently affecting 
      attention and working memory functions. Functional imaging studies investigating 
      those functions in MS patients are hard to compare, as they include heterogeneous 
      patient groups and use different paradigms for cognitive testing. The aim of this 
      study was to investigate alterations in neuronal activation between MS patients and 
      healthy controls performing attention and working memory tasks. Two meta-analyses of 
      previously published fMRI studies investigating attention and working memory were 
      conducted for MS patients and healthy controls, respectively. Resulting maps were 
      contrasted to compare brain activation in patients and healthy controls. 
      Significantly increased brain activation in the inferior parietal lobule and the 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was detected for healthy controls. In contrast, 
      higher neuronal activation in MS patients was obtained in the left ventrolateral 
      prefrontal cortex and the right premotor area. With this meta-analytic approach 
      previous results of investigations examining cognitive function using fMRI are 
      summarized and compared. Therefore a more general view on cognitive dysfunction in 
      this heterogeneous disease is enabled.

TI  - Auditory working memory load impairs visual ventral stream processing: toward a 
      unified model of attentional load.
PG  - 437-46
LID - 10.1162/jocn.2009.21204 [doi]
AB  - Attentional interference between tasks performed in parallel is known to have strong 
      and often undesired effects. As yet, however, the mechanisms by which interference 
      operates remain elusive. A better knowledge of these processes may facilitate our 
      understanding of the effects of attention on human performance and the debilitating 
      consequences that disruptions to attention can have. According to the load theory of 
      cognitive control, processing of task-irrelevant stimuli is increased by attending 
      in parallel to a relevant task with high cognitive demands. This is due to the 
      relevant task engaging cognitive control resources that are, hence, unavailable to 
      inhibit the processing of task-irrelevant stimuli. However, it has also been 
      demonstrated that a variety of types of load (perceptual and emotional) can result 
      in a reduction of the processing of task-irrelevant stimuli, suggesting a uniform 
      effect of increased load irrespective of the type of load. In the present study, we 
      concurrently presented a relevant auditory matching task [n-back working memory 
      (WM)] of low or high cognitive load (1-back or 2-back WM) and task-irrelevant images 
      at one of three object visibility levels (0%, 50%, or 100%). fMRI activation during 
      the processing of the task-irrelevant visual stimuli was measured in the lateral 
      occipital cortex and found to be reduced under high, compared to low, WM load. In 
      combination with previous findings, this result is suggestive of a more generalized 
      load theory, whereby cognitive load, as well as other types of load (e.g., 
      perceptual), can result in a reduction of the processing of task-irrelevant stimuli, 
      in line with a uniform effect of increased load irrespective of the type of load.

TI  - fMRI: blood oxygen level-dependent activation during a working memory-selective 
      attention task in children born extremely preterm.
PG  - 196-205
LID - 10.1038/pr.2013.79 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extremely preterm (EPT)/extremely low-birth-weight (ELBW) children 
      attaining school age and adolescence often have problems with executive functions 
      such as working memory and selective attention. Our aim was to investigate a 
      hypothesized difference in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activation during a 
      selective attention-working memory task in EPT/ELBW children as compared with 
      term-born controls. METHODS: A regional cohort of 28 EPT/ELBW children and 28 
      term-born controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning 
      at 11 y of age while performing a combined Stroop n-back task. Group differences in 
      BOLD activation were analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 analysis 
      software package, and reaction times (RTs) and response accuracy (RA) were compared 
      in a multifactorial ANOVA test. RESULTS: The BOLD activation pattern in the preterm 
      group involved the same areas (cingulate, prefrontal, and parietal cortexes), but 
      all areas displayed significantly less activation than those in the control group, 
      particularly when the cognitive load was increased. The RA results corresponded with 
      the activation data in that the preterm group had significantly fewer correct 
      responses. No group difference was found regarding RTs. CONCLUSION: Children born 
      EPT/ELBW displayed reduced working memory and selective attention capacity as 
      compared with term-born controls. These impairments had neuronal correlates with 
      reduced BOLD activation in areas responsible for online stimulus monitoring, working 
      memory, and cognitive control.

TI  - Persistent infection by HSV-1 is associated with changes in functional architecture 
      of iPSC-derived neurons and brain activation patterns underlying working memory 
      performance.
PG  - 123-32
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbu032 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1) commonly produces lytic mucosal 
      lesions. It invariably initiates latent infection in sensory ganglia enabling 
      persistent, lifelong infection. Acute HSV-1 encephalitis is rare and definitive 
      evidence of latent infection in the brain is lacking. However, exposure untraceable 
      to encephalitis has been repeatedly associated with impaired working memory and 
      executive functions, particularly among schizophrenia patients. METHODS: Patterns of 
      HSV-1 infection and gene expression changes were examined in human induced 
      pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. Separately, differences in blood 
      oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses to working memory challenges using 
      letter n-back tests were investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) among schizophrenia cases/controls. RESULTS: HSV-1 induced lytic changes in 
      iPSC-derived glutamatergic neurons and neuroprogenitor cells. In neurons, HSV-1 also 
      entered a quiescent state following coincubation with antiviral drugs, with 
      distinctive changes in gene expression related to functions such as glutamatergic 
      signaling. In the fMRI studies, main effects of schizophrenia (P = .001) and HSV-1 
      exposure (1-back, P = 1.76 × 10(-4); 2-back, P = 1.39 × 10(-5)) on BOLD responses 
      were observed. We also noted increased BOLD responses in the frontoparietal, 
      thalamus, and midbrain regions among HSV-1 exposed schizophrenia cases and controls, 
      compared with unexposed persons. CONCLUSIONS: The lytic/quiescent cycles in 
      iPSC-derived neurons indicate that persistent neuronal infection can occur, altering 
      cellular function. The fMRI studies affirm the associations between nonencephalitic 
      HSV-1 infection and functional brain changes linked with working memory impairment. 
      The fMRI and iPSC studies together provide putative mechanisms for the cognitive 
      impairments linked to HSV-1 exposure.

      behavioral performance.
PG  - 3204-15

AB  - Although resting-state brain activity has been demonstrated to correspond with 
      task-evoked brain activation, the relationship between intrinsic and evoked brain 
      activity has not been fully characterized. For example, it is unclear whether 
      intrinsic activity can also predict task-evoked deactivation and whether the 
      rest-task relationship is dependent on task load. In this study, we addressed these 
      issues on 40 healthy control subjects using resting-state and task-driven [N-back 
      working memory (WM) task] functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected in 
      the same session. Using amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) as an index of 
      intrinsic resting-state activity, we found that ALFF in the middle frontal gyrus and 
      inferior/superior parietal lobules was positively correlated with WM task-evoked 
      activation, while ALFF in the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, 
      superior frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and fusiform gyrus was negatively 
      correlated with WM task-evoked deactivation. Further, the relationship between the 
      intrinsic resting-state activity and task-evoked activation in lateral/superior 
      frontal gyri, inferior/superior parietal lobules, superior temporal gyrus, and 
      midline regions was stronger at higher WM task loads. In addition, both 
      resting-state activity and the task-evoked activation in the superior parietal 
      lobule/precuneus were significantly correlated with the WM task behavioral 
      performance, explaining similar portions of intersubject performance variance. 
      Together, these findings suggest that intrinsic resting-state activity facilitates 
      or is permissive of specific brain circuit engagement to perform a cognitive task, 
      and that resting activity can predict subsequent task-evoked brain responses and 
      behavioral performance.

TI  - Genetically determined measures of striatal D2 signaling predict prefrontal activity 
      during working memory performance.
PG  - e9348
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0009348 [doi]
LID - e9348
AB  - BACKGROUND: Variation of the gene coding for D2 receptors (DRD2) has been associated 
      with risk for schizophrenia and with working memory deficits. A functional intronic 
      SNP (rs1076560) predicts relative expression of the two D2 receptors isoforms, D2S 
      (mainly pre-synaptic) and D2L (mainly post-synaptic). However, the effect of 
      functional genetic variation of DRD2 on striatal dopamine D2 signaling and on its 
      correlation with prefrontal activity during working memory in humans is not known. 
      METHODS: Thirty-seven healthy subjects were genotyped for rs1076560 (G>T) and 
      underwent SPECT with [123I]IBZM (which binds primarily to post-synaptic D2 
      receptors) and with [123I]FP-CIT (which binds to pre-synaptic dopamine transporters, 
      whose activity and density is also regulated by pre-synaptic D2 receptors), as well 
      as BOLD fMRI during N-Back working memory. RESULTS: Subjects carrying the T allele 
      (previously associated with reduced D2S expression) had striatal reductions of 
      [123I]IBZM and of [123I]FP-CIT binding. DRD2 genotype also differentially predicted 
      the correlation between striatal dopamine D2 signaling (as identified with factor 
      analysis of the two radiotracers) and activity of the prefrontal cortex during 
      working memory as measured with BOLD fMRI, which was positive in GG subjects and 
      negative in GT. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that this functional SNP within 
      DRD2 predicts striatal binding of the two radiotracers to dopamine transporters and 
      D2 receptors as well as the correlation between striatal D2 signaling with 
      prefrontal cortex activity during performance of a working memory task. These data 
      are consistent with the possibility that the balance of excitatory/inhibitory 
      modulation of striatal neurons may also affect striatal outputs in relationship with 
      prefrontal activity during working memory performance within the 
      cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical pathway.

TI  - Brain activity in cigarette smokers performing a working memory task: effect of 
      smoking abstinence.
PG  - 143-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: When nicotine-dependent human subjects abstain from cigarette smoking, 
      they exhibit deficits in working memory. An understanding of the neural substrates 
      of such impairments may help to understand how nicotine affects cognition. Our aim, 
      therefore, was to identify abnormalities in the circuitry that mediates working 
      memory in nicotine-dependent subjects after they initiate abstinence from smoking. 
      METHODS: We used blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) to study eight smokers while they performed a letter version of the 
      N-Back working memory task under satiety (< or = 1.5 hours abstinence) and 
      abstinence (> or = 14 hours abstinence) conditions. RESULTS: Task-related activity 
      in the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) showed a significant 
      interaction between test session (satiety, abstinence) and task load (1-back, 
      2-back, and 3-back). This interaction reflected the fact that task-related activity 
      in the satiety condition was relatively low during performance of the 1-back task 
      but greater at the more difficult task levels, whereas task-related activity in the 
      abstinence condition was relatively high at the 1-back level and did not increase at 
      the more difficult task levels. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that neural processing 
      related to working memory in the left DLPFC is less efficient during acute 
      abstinence from smoking than at smoking satiety.

LID - 86
AB  - N-back working memory (WM) tasks necessitate the maintenance and updating of dynamic 
      rehearsal sets during performance. The delayed matching-to-sample (dMTS) task is 
      another WM task, which in turn involves the encoding, maintenance, and retrieval of 
      stimulus representations in sequential order. Because both n-back and dMTS engage WM 
      function, we hypothesized that compared to a control task not taxing WM, training on 
      the n-back task would be associated with better performance on dMTS by virtue of 
      training a shared mental capacity. We tested this hypothesis by randomly assigning 
      subjects (N = 43) to train on either the n-back (including 2-back and 3-back levels) 
      or an active control task. Following training, dMTS was administered in the fMRI 
      scanner. The n-back group performed marginally better than the active control group 
      on dMTS. In addition, although the n-back group improved more on the less difficult 
      2-back level than the more difficult 3-back level across training sessions, it was 
      improvement on the 3-back level that accounted for 21% of the variance in dMTS 
      performance. For the control group, improvement in training across sessions was 
      unrelated to dMTS performance. At the neural level, greater activation in the left 
      inferior frontal gyrus, right posterior parietal cortex, and the cerebellum 
      distinguished the n-back group from the control group in the maintenance phase of 
      dMTS. Degree of improvement on the 3-back level across training sessions was 
      correlated with activation in right lateral prefrontal and motor cortices in the 
      maintenance phase of dMTS. Our results suggest that although n-back training is more 
      likely to improve performance in easier blocks, it is improvement in more difficult 
      blocks that is predictive of performance on a target task drawing on WM. In 
      addition, the extent to which training on a task can transfer to another task is 
      likely due to the engagement of shared cognitive capacities and underlying neural 
      substrates-in this case WM.

TI  - Functional brain imaging in survivors of critical illness: A prospective feasibility 
      study and exploration of the association between delirium and brain activation 
      patterns.

AB  - PURPOSE: We undertook this pilot prospective cohort investigation to examine the 
      feasibility of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) assessments in survivors 
      of critical illness and to analyze potential associations between delirium and brain 
      activation patterns observed during a working memory task (N-back) at hospital 
      discharge and 3-month follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At hospital discharge and 3 
      months later, fMRI assessed subjects' functional activity during an N-back task. 
      Multiple linear regression was used to examine associations between duration of 
      delirium and brain activity, and elastic net regression was used to assess the 
      relationship between brain activation patterns at 3 months and cognitive outcomes at 
      12 months. RESULTS: Of 47 patients who underwent fMRI at discharge, 38 (80%) 
      completed the protocol; of 37 who underwent fMRI at 3 months, 34 (91%) completed the 
      protocol. At discharge, the mean (SD) percentage of correct responses on the most 
      challenging version (the N2 version) of the N-back task was 70.4 (23.2; range of 
      20-100) compared with 76 (23.4; range of 33-100) at 3 months. No association was 
      observed between delirium duration in the hospital and brain region activity in any 
      brain region at discharge or 3 months after adjusting for relevant covariates (P 
      values across all 11 brain regions of interest were >.25). CONCLUSIONS: Our data 
      support the feasibility of using fMRI in survivors of critical illness at 3-month 
      follow-up but not at discharge. In this small study, delirium was not associated 
      with distinct or abnormal brain activation patterns, although overall performance on 
      a cognitive task of working memory was poorer than observed in other cohorts of 
      individuals with medically related executive dysfunction, mild cognitive impairment, 
      and mild traumatic brain injury.

TI  - Dietary saturated fat and monounsaturated fat have reversible effects on brain 
      function and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in young women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous literature suggests that a higher ratio of palmitic acid 
      (PA)/oleic acid (OA) in the diet induces inflammation, which may result in deficient 
      brain insulin signaling, and, secondarily, impaired physical activity, sleep 
      efficiency, and cognitive functioning. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that lowering the 
      typical dietary PA/OA would affect the activation of relevant brain networks during 
      a working memory task and would also lower secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. 
      DESIGN: In 12 female subjects participating in a randomized, cross-over trial 
      comparing 3-week high PA diet (HPA) and low PA and a high OA diet (HOA), we 
      evaluated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using an N-back test of 
      working memory, cytokine secretion by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated peripheral 
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and plasma cytokine concentrations. RESULTS: Brain 
      activation during the HPA diet compared to the HOA diet was increased in regions of 
      the basal ganglia including the caudate and putamen (p<0.005). In addition, compared 
      to the HOA diet, during the HPA diet, the plasma concentrations of IL-6 (p=0.04) and 
      IL-1β (p=0.05) were higher, and there was a higher secretion of IL-18 (p=0.015) and 
      a trend for higher IL-1β secretion (p=0.066) from LPS-stimulated PBMCs. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The HPA diet resulted in increased brain activation in the basal ganglia compared to 
      the HOA diet as well as increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These 
      data provide evidence that short-term (2week) diet interventions impact brain 
      network activation during a working memory task and that these effects are 
      reversible since the order of the study diets was randomized. These data are 
      consistent with the hypothesis that lowering the dietary PA content via substitution 
      with OA also could affect cognition.

TI  - Physiological dysfunction of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia 
      revisited.
PG  - 1078-92
AB  - Evidence implicates subtle neuronal pathology of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in 
      schizophrenia, but how this pathology is reflected in physiological neuroimaging 
      experiments remains controversial. We investigated PFC function in schizophrenia 
      using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a parametric version of the 
      n-back working memory (WM) task. In a group of patients who performed relatively 
      well on this task, there were three fundamental deviations from the 'healthy' 
      pattern of PFC fMRI activation to varying WM difficulty. The first characteristic 
      was a greater magnitude of PFC fMRI activation in the context of slightly impaired 
      WM performance (i.e. physiological inefficiency). The second was that the 
      significant correlations between behavioral WM performance and dorsal PFC fMRI 
      activation were in opposite directions in the two groups. Third, the magnitude of 
      the abnormal dorsal PFC fMRI response was predicted by an assay of N-acetylaspartate 
      concentrations (NAA) in dorsal PFC, a measure of neuronal pathology obtained using 
      proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Patients had significantly lower dorsal PFC 
      NAA than controls and dorsal PFC NAA inversely predicted the fMRI response in dorsal 
      PFC (areas 9, 46) to varying WM difficulty - supporting the assumption that abnormal 
      PFC responses arose from abnormal PFC neurons. These data suggest that under certain 
      conditions the physiological ramifications of dorsal PFC neuronal pathology in 
      schizophrenia includes exaggerated and inefficient cortical activity, especially of 
      dorsal PFC.

AB  - Emerging evidence indicates that repetitive head impacts, even at a sub-concussive 
      level, may result in exacerbated or prolonged neurological deficits in athletes. 
      This study aimed to: 1) quantify the effect of repetitive head impacts on the 
      alteration of neuronal activity based on functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) of working memory after a high school football season; and 2) determine 
      whether a neck collar that applies mild jugular vein compression designed to reduce 
      brain energy absorption in head impact through "slosh" mitigation can ameliorate the 
      altered fMRI activation during a working memory task. Participants were recruited 
      from local high school football teams with 27 and 25 athletes assigned to the 
      non-collar and collar group, respectively. A standard N-Back task was used to engage 
      working memory in the fMRI at both pre- and post-season. The two study groups 
      experienced similar head impact frequency and magnitude during the season (all 
      p > 0.05). fMRI blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal response (a reflection of 
      the neuronal activity level) during the working memory task increased significantly 
      from pre- to post-season in the non-collar group (corrected p < 0.05), but not in 
      the collar group. Areas displaying less activation change in the collar group 
      (corrected p < 0.05) included the precuneus, inferior parietal cortex, and dorsal 
      lateral prefrontal cortex. Additionally, BOLD response in the non-collar group 
      increased significantly in direct association with the total number of impacts and 
      total g-force (p < 0.05). Our data provide initial neuroimaging evidence for the 
      effect of repetitive head impacts on the working memory related brain activity, as 
      well as a potential protective effect that resulted from the use of the purported 
      brain slosh reducing neck collar in contact sports.

TI  - Developmental neural networks in children performing a Categorical N-Back Task.
PG  - 980-90
AB  - The prefrontal and temporal networks subserving object working memory tasks in 
      adults have been reported as immature in young children; yet children are adequately 
      capable of performing such tasks. We investigated the basis of this apparent 
      contradiction using a complex object working memory task, a Categorical n-back 
      (CN-BT). We examined whether the neural networks engaged by the CN-BT in children 
      consist of the same brain regions as those in adults, but with a different magnitude 
      of activation, or whether the networks are qualitatively different. Event-related 
      fMRI was used to study differences in brain activation between healthy children ages 
      6 and 10 years, and young adults (20-28 years). Performance accuracy and RTs in 
      10-year-olds and adults were comparable, but the performance in 6-year-olds was 
      lower. In adults, the CN-BT was highly effective in engaging the bilateral (L>R) 
      ventral prefrontal cortex, the bilateral fusiform gyrus, posterior cingulate and 
      precuneus, thus suggesting an involvement of the ventral visual stream, with related 
      feature extraction and semantic labeling strategies. In children, the brain networks 
      were distinctly different. They involved the premotor and parietal cortex, anterior 
      insula, caudate/putamen, and the cerebellum, thus suggesting a predominant 
      involvement of the visual dorsal and sensory-motor pathways, with related 
      visual-spatial and action cognitive strategies. The findings indicate engagement of 
      developmental networks in children reflecting task-effective brain activation. The 
      age-related pattern of fMRI activation suggests a working hypothesis of a 
      developmental shift from reliance on the dorsal visual stream and 
      premotor/striatal/cerebellar networks in young children to reliance on the ventral 
      prefrontal and inferior temporal networks in adults.

AB  - AIMS: Disturbed levels of thyroid hormones are associated with neuropsychiatric 
      disorders, including memory impairments. The aim of this study was to evaluate 
      effects of mild induced thyrotoxicosis on working memory and its neural correlates. 
      METHODS: Twenty-nine healthy, male subjects with normal thyroid state participated 
      in the study. Functional MRI was acquired during a working memory task (n-back task) 
      before and after ingesting 250 μg L-thyroxin per day for a period of eight weeks. In 
      addition, neuropsychological tests were performed. RESULTS: In the hyperthyroid 
      condition the subjects showed slower reaction times, but a higher accuracy in the 
      0-back version of the memory tasks. Fewer differences between euthyroid and 
      hyperthyroid state were seen for the more difficult conditions of the n-back task. 
      FMRI revealed effects of difficulty in the parahippocampal gyrus, supplementary 
      motor area, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cerebellum, 
      rolandic operculum and insula (p<0.05, FWE corrected). When comparing euthyroid and 
      hyperthyroid condition in relation to task-induced activation, differences of 
      activation were found in the right prefrontal cortex as well as in the right 
      parahippocampal area. In the psychological assessment, the alerting effect in the 
      Attention Network Task (ANT) and four out of five parameters of the auditory verbal 
      learning test (AVLT) showed an increase from euthyroid to hyperthyroid state. 
      CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that even a short-term intake of thyroid hormones 
      leads to an activation of brain areas associated with working memory and to an 
      improvement of accuracy of working memory tasks.

TI  - Statistical parametric network analysis of functional connectivity dynamics during a 
      working memory task.

AB  - Network analysis has become a tool of choice for the study of functional and 
      structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. Little research, however, has 
      investigated connectivity dynamics in relation to varying cognitive load. In fMRI, 
      correlations among slow (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations of blood oxygen level dependent 
      (BOLD) signal can be used to construct functional connectivity networks. Using an 
      anatomical parcellation scheme, we produced undirected weighted graphs linking 90 
      regions of the brain representing major cortical gyri and subcortical nuclei, in a 
      population of healthy adults (n=43). Topological changes in these networks were 
      investigated under different conditions of a classical working memory task - the 
      N-back paradigm. A mass-univariate approach was adopted to construct statistical 
      parametric networks (SPNs) that reflect significant modifications in functional 
      connectivity between N-back conditions. Our proposed method allowed the extraction 
      of 'lost' and 'gained' functional networks, providing concise graphical summaries of 
      whole-brain network topological changes. Robust estimates of functional networks are 
      obtained by pooling information about edges and vertices over subjects. Graph 
      thresholding is therefore here supplanted by inference. The analysis proceeds by 
      firstly considering changes in weighted cost (i.e. mean between-region correlation) 
      over the different N-back conditions and secondly comparing small-world topological 
      measures integrated over network cost, thereby controlling for differences in mean 
      correlation between conditions. The results are threefold: (i) functional networks 
      in the four conditions were all found to satisfy the small-world property and 
      cost-integrated global and local efficiency levels were approximately preserved 
      across the different experimental conditions; (ii) weighted cost considerably 
      decreased as working memory load increased; and (iii) subject-specific weighted 
      costs significantly predicted behavioral performances on the N-back task (Wald 
      F=13.39,df(1)=1,df(2)=83,p<0.001), and therefore conferred predictive validity to 
      functional connectivity strength, as measured by weighted cost. The results were 
      found to be highly sensitive to the frequency band used for the computation of the 
      between-region correlations, with the relationship between weighted cost and 
      behavioral performance being most salient at very low frequencies (0.01-0.03 Hz). 
      These findings are discussed in relation to the integration/specialization 
      functional dichotomy. The pruning of functional networks under increasing cognitive 
      load may permit greater modular specialization, thereby enhancing performance.

TI  - Prefrontal hyperactivation during working memory task in untreated individuals with 
      major depressive disorder.
PG  - 158-66
AB  - The prefrontal cortex, a part of the limbic-thalamic-cortical network, participates 
      in regulation of mood, cognition and behavior and has been implicated in the 
      pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). Many neuropsychological studies 
      demonstrate impairment of working memory in patients with MDD. However, there are 
      few functional neuroimaging studies of MDD patients during working memory 
      processing, and most of the available ones included medicated patients or patients 
      with both MDD and bipolar disorder. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) to measure prefrontal cortex function during working memory processing in 
      untreated depressed patients with MDD. Fifteen untreated individuals with Diagnostic 
      and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition recurrent MDD (mean 
      age+/-s.d.=34.3+/-11.5 years) and 15 healthy comparison subjects (37.7+/-12.1 years) 
      matched for age, sex and race were studied using a GE/Elscint 2T MR system. An 
      echo-planar MRI sequence was used to acquire 24 axial slices. The n-back task 
      (0-back, 1-back and 2-back) was used to elicit frontal cortex activation. Data were 
      analyzed with a multiple regression analysis using the FSL-FEAT software. MDD 
      patients showed significantly greater left dorsolateral cortex activation during the 
      n-back task compared to the healthy controls (P<0.01), although task performance was 
      similar in the two groups. Furthermore, the patients showed significant anterior 
      cingulate cortex activation during the task, but the comparison subjects did not 
      (P<0.01). This study provides in vivo imaging evidence of abnormal frontolimbic 
      circuit function during working memory processing in individuals with MDD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study explores the functional and structural patterns of 
      connectivity underlying working memory impairment after severe traumatic axonal 
      injury. METHODS: We performed an fMRI n-back task and acquired diffusion tensor 
      images (DTI) in a group of 19 chronic-stage patients with severe traumatic brain 
      injury (TBI) and evidence of traumatic axonal injury and 19 matched healthy 
      controls. We performed image analyses with FSL software and fMRI data were analyzed 
      using probabilistic independent component analysis. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps 
      from DTI images were analyzed with FMRIB's Diffusion Toolbox. RESULTS: We identified 
      working memory and default mode networks. Global FA values correlated with both 
      networks and FA whole-brain analysis revealed correlations in several tracts 
      associated with the functional activation. Furthermore, working memory performance 
      in the patient group correlated with the functional activation patterns and with the 
      FA values of the associative fasciculi. CONCLUSION: Combining structural and 
      functional neuroimaging data, we were able to describe structural white matter 
      changes related to functional network alterations and to lower performance in 
      working memory in chronic TBI.

TI  - Enhancement of functional connectivity, working memory and inhibitory control on 
      multi-modal brain MR imaging with Rifaximin in Cirrhosis: implications for the 
      gut-liver-brain axis.
PG  - 1017-25

AB  - Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) impairs daily functioning in cirrhosis, but its 
      functional brain impact is not completely understood. To evaluate the effect of 
      rifaximin, a gut-specific antibiotic, on the gut-liver-brain axis in MHE. 
      HYPOTHESIS: Rifaximin will reduce endotoxemia, enhance cognition, increase 
      activation during working memory(N-back) and reduce activation needed for inhibitory 
      control tasks. METHODS: Cirrhotics with MHE underwent baseline endotoxin and 
      cognitive testing, then underwent fMRI, diffusion tensor imaging and MR 
      spectroscopy(MRS). On fMRI, two tasks; N-back (outcome: correct responses) and 
      inhibitory control tests(outcomes: lure inhibition) were performed. All procedures 
      were repeated after 8 weeks of rifaximin. RESULTS were compared before/after 
      rifaximin. RESULTS: 20 MHE patients (59.7 years) were included; sixteen completed 
      pre/post-rifaximin scanning with 92% medication compliance. Pre-rifaximin patients 
      had cognitive impairment. At trial-end, there was a significantly higher correct 
      2-back responses, ICT lure inhibitions and reduced endotoxemia(p = 0.002). This was 
      accompanied by significantly higher activation from baseline in subcortical 
      structures (thalamus, caudate, insula and hippocampus) and left parietal operculum 
      (LPO) during N-back, decrease in fronto-parietal activation required for inhibiting 
      lures, including LPO during ICT compared to baseline values. Connectivity studies in 
      N-back showed significant shifts in linkages after therapy in fronto-parietal 
      regions with a reduction in fractional anisotropy (FA) but not mean diffusivity 
      (MD), and no change in MRS metabolites at the end of the trial. A significant 
      improvement in cognition including working memory and inhibitory control, and 
      fractional anisotropy without effect on MD or MRS, through modulation of 
      fronto-parietal and subcortical activation and connectivity was seen after 
      open-label rifaximin therapy in MHE.

TI  - A pilot study of changes in functional brain activity during a working memory task 
      after mSMT treatment: The MEMREHAB trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Working memory deficits are common in multiple sclerosis (MS). The 
      modified Story Memory Technique (mSMT) has been shown to improve new learning and 
      memory in MS, but its effects on working memory (WM) are currently unknown. 
      OBJECTIVE: The present study presents a secondary analysis of data from a larger 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial and examines changes in 
      cerebral activation on a WM task following mSMT treatment. METHODS: Sixteen 
      participants with clinically definite MS were randomly assigned to treatment (n=7) 
      or placebo-control groups (n=9) matched for gender, age and education. Baseline and 
      immediate follow-up functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was obtained for 
      all subjects. During fMRI participants completed an N-back task, consisting of 0-, 
      1-and 2-back conditions. RESULTS: Significant increases in cerebral activation were 
      noted in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area and inferior 
      parietal lobule at follow-up in the treatment group. No significant changes were 
      noted in the placebo control group. CONCLUSION: Due to the small sample size, 
      results of the current study should be interpreted as preliminary. However, the 
      observed pattern of activation of the frontoparietal network involved in WM found in 
      the treatment group, suggests that mSMT training increases recruitment of attention- 
      and WM-related neural networks. We conclude that mSMT treatment leads to changes in 
      WM-related cerebral activation.

TI  - Disorder-dissociated effects of fluoxetine on brain function of working memory in 
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder.
PG  - 1195-205
LID - 10.1017/S0033291714002232 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum 
      disorder (ASD) are often co-morbid and share performance and brain dysfunctions 
      during working memory (WM). Serotonin agonists modulate WM and there is evidence of 
      positive behavioural effects in both disorders. We therefore used functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate shared and disorder-specific brain 
      dysfunctions of WM in these disorders, and the effects of a single dose of the 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine. METHOD: Age-matched boys 
      with ADHD (n = 17), ASD (n = 17) and controls (n = 22) were compared using fMRI 
      during an N-back WM task. Patients were scanned twice, under either an acute dose of 
      fluoxetine or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized design. 
      Repeated-measures analyses within patients assessed drug effects on performance and 
      brain function. To test for normalization effects of brain dysfunctions, patients 
      under each drug condition were compared to controls. RESULTS: Under placebo, 
      relative to controls, both ADHD and ASD boys shared underactivation in the right 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Fluoxetine significantly normalized the 
      DLPFC underactivation in ASD relative to controls whereas it increased posterior 
      cingulate cortex (PCC) deactivation in ADHD relative to control boys. Within-patient 
      analyses showed inverse effects of fluoxetine on PCC deactivation, which it enhanced 
      in ADHD and decreased in ASD. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show that fluoxetine 
      modulates brain activation during WM in a disorder-specific manner by normalizing 
      task-positive DLPFC dysfunction in ASD boys and enhancing task-negative default mode 
      network (DMN) deactivation in ADHD.

TI  - Polymorphism in schizophrenia risk gene MIR137 is associated with the posterior

AB  - MIR137 gene has been repeatedly reported as a schizophrenia risk gene in genome-wide 
      association studies (GWAS). A polymorphism (rs1625579) at the MIR137 gene has been 
      associated with both neural activation and behavioral performance during a working 
      memory task. This study examined MIR137's associations with task-related (N-back 
      working memory) fMRI, resting state fMRI, and diffusion tensor images (DTI) data in 
      177 healthy adults. We found less deactivation of the PCC in risk allele homozygotes 
      (TT) as compared to the GT heterozygotes (cluster size = 630 voxels, cluster level 
      P(FWE) < 0.001) during the N-back task, which replicated previous findings. Using 
      the identified cluster within the PCC as the seed, we further found decreased 
      functional connectivity between the PCC and the anterior cingulate cortex and its 
      adjacent medial prefrontal cortex (ACC/MPFC) in risk allele homozygotes during both 
      resting state (cluster size = 427 voxels, cluster level P(FWE) = 0.001) and the 
      N-back task (cluster size = 73 voxels, cluster level P(FWE) = 0.05). Finally, an 
      analysis of our DTI data showed decreased white matter integrity of the posterior 
      cingulum in risk allele homozygotes (cluster size = 214 voxels, cluster level 
      P(FWE) = 0.03). Taken together, rs1625579 seems to play an important role in both 
      functional and structural connectivity between the PCC and the ACC/MPFC, which may 
      serve as the brain mechanisms for the link between rs1625579 and schizophrenia.

PG  - 1150-7
AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI studies involving n-back spatial 
      working memory (WM) tasks were conducted in adults and children with Fetal Alcohol 
      Spectrum Disorders (FASD), and in age- and sex-matched controls. FMRI experiments 
      demonstrated consistent activations in regions of the brain associated with working 
      memory. Children with FASD displayed greater inferior-middle frontal lobe activity, 
      while greater superior frontal and parietal lobe activity was observed in controls. 
      Control children also showed an overall increase in frontal lobe activity with 
      increasing task difficulty, while children with FASD showed decreased activity. FASD 
      adults demonstrated less functional brain activity overall, but greater 
      inferior-middle frontal lobe activity during the simpler tasks, relative to 
      controls. Control adults demonstrated greater inferior frontal activity with 
      increasing task difficulty, while this pattern was not consistently observed in FASD 
      adults. All four groups showed increasing activity with increases in task difficulty 
      in the parietal and frontal regions at more superior slice levels. The results 
      suggest impairment in spatial working memory in those with FASD that does not 
      improve with age, and that fMRI may be useful in evaluation of brain function in 
      these individuals.

AB  - A recent model by Postma and colleagues posits that the encoding of object location 
      associations (OLAs) requires the coordination of several cognitive processes 
      mediated by ventral (object perception) and dorsal (spatial perception) visual 
      pathways as well as the hippocampus (feature binding) [1]. Within this model, 
      frontoparietal network recruitment is believed to contribute to both the spatial 
      processing and working memory task demands. The current study used functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test each step of this model in 15 participants 
      who encoded OLAs and performed standard n-back tasks. As expected, object processing 
      resulted in activation of the ventral visual stream. Object in location processing 
      resulted in activation of both the ventral and dorsal visual streams as well as a 
      lateral frontoparietal network. This condition was also the only one to result in 
      medial temporal lobe activation, supporting its role in associative learning. A 
      conjunction analysis revealed areas of shared activation between the working memory 
      and object in location phase within the lateral frontoparietal network, anterior 
      insula, and basal ganglia; consistent with prior working memory literature. Overall, 
      findings support Postma and colleague's model and provide clear evidence for the 
      role of working memory during OLA encoding.

TI  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val(66)Met genotype and ovarian steroids 
      interactively modulate working memory-related hippocampal function in women: a 
      multimodal neuroimaging study.
PG  - 1066-1075
LID - 10.1038/mp.2017.72 [doi]
AB  - Preclinical evidence suggests that the actions of ovarian steroid hormones and 
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are highly convergent on brain function. 
      Studies in humanized mice document an interaction between estrus cycle-related 
      changes in estradiol secretion and BDNF Val(66)Met genotype on measures of 
      hippocampal function and anxiety-like behavior. We believe our multimodal imaging 
      data provide the first demonstration in women that the effects of the BDNF Val/Met 
      polymorphism on hippocampal function are selectively modulated by estradiol. In a 
      6-month pharmacological hormone manipulation protocol, healthy, regularly 
      menstruating, asymptomatic women completed positron emission tomography (PET) and 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans while performing the n-back 
      working memory task during three hormone conditions: ovarian suppression induced by 
      the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, leuprolide acetate; leuprolide plus 
      estradiol; and leuprolide plus progesterone. For each of the three hormone 
      conditions, a discovery data set was obtained with oxygen-15 water regional cerebral 
      blood flow PET in 39 healthy women genotyped for BDNF Val(66)Met, and a confirmatory 
      data set was obtained with fMRI in 27 women. Our results, in close agreement across 
      the two imaging platforms, demonstrate an ovarian hormone-by-BDNF interaction on 
      working memory-related hippocampal function (PET: F(2,37)=9.11, P=0.00026 
      uncorrected, P=0.05, familywise error corrected with small volume correction; fMRI: 
      F(2,25)=5.43, P=0.01, uncorrected) that reflects differential hippocampal 
      recruitment in Met carriers but only in the presence of estradiol. These findings 
      have clinical relevance for understanding the neurobiological basis of individual 
      differences in the cognitive and behavioral effects of ovarian steroids in women, 
      and may provide a neurogenetic framework for understanding neuropsychiatric 
      disorders related to reproductive hormones as well as illnesses with sex differences 
      in disease expression and course.

AB  - Network neuroscience provides tools that can easily be used to verify main 
      assumptions of the global workspace theory (GWT), such as the existence of highly 
      segregated information processing during effortless tasks performance, engagement of 
      multiple distributed networks during effortful tasks and the critical role of 
      long-range connections in workspace formation. A number of studies support the 
      assumptions of GWT by showing the reorganization of the whole-brain functional 
      network during cognitive task performance; however, the involvement of specific 
      large scale networks in the formation of workspace is still not well-understood. The 
      aims of our study were: (1) to examine changes in the whole-brain functional network 
      under increased cognitive demands of working memory during an n-back task, and their 
      relationship with behavioral outcomes; and (2) to provide a comprehensive 
      description of local changes that may be involved in the formation of the global 
      workspace, using hub detection and network-based statistic. Our results show that 
      network modularity decreased with increasing cognitive demands, and this change 
      allowed us to predict behavioral performance. The number of connector hubs 
      increased, whereas the number of provincial hubs decreased when the task became more 
      demanding. We also found that the default mode network (DMN) increased its 
      connectivity to other networks while decreasing connectivity between its own 
      regions. These results, apart from replicating previous findings, provide a valuable 
      insight into the mechanisms of the formation of the global workspace, highlighting 
      the role of the DMN in the processes of network integration. Hum Brain Mapp

TI  - Specific versus nonspecific brain activity in a parametric N-back task.
PG  - 688-97
AB  - In this study functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine 
      cerebral activity patterns in relation to increasing mental load of a working memory 
      task. Aim of the experiment was to distinguish nonspecific task-related processes 
      from specific workload processes analytically. Twelve healthy volunteers engaged in 
      a spatial n-back task with four levels. FMRI data were acquired with the 3D-PRESTO 
      pulse sequence. Analysis entailed a two-step multiple regression algorithm, which 
      was specifically designed to measure and separate load-sensitive and 
      load-insensitive activity simultaneously, while preserving the original high spatial 
      resolution of the fMRI signal. Load-sensitive and load-insensitive activity was 
      found in both dorsolateral-prefrontal and parietal cortex, predominantly 
      bilaterally, and in the anterior cingulate. As expected, the left primary 
      sensorimotor cortex showed predominantly load-insensitive activity. Load-sensitive 
      activity reflects specific working memory functions, such as temporary retention and 
      manipulation of information, while load-insensitive activity reflects supportive 
      functions, such as visual orientation, perception, encoding, and response selection 
      and execution. Good performance was correlated with a large area of load-sensitive 
      activity in anterior cingulate, and with a small area of load-insensitive activity 
      in the right parietal cortex. The findings indicate that nonspecific and specific 
      working memory processes colocalize and are represented in multiple frontal and 
      parietal regions. Implication of this analytical strategy for application in 
      research on psychiatric disorders is discussed.

AB  - Working memory is sensitive to aging-related decline. Evidence exists that aging is 
      accompanied by a reorganization of the working-memory circuitry, but the underlying 
      neurocognitive mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we examined aging-related 
      changes in prefrontal activation during working-memory performance using functional 
      Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), a noninvasive neuroimaging technique. Seventeen 
      healthy young (21-32 years) and 17 healthy older adults (64-81 years) performed a 
      verbal working-memory task (n-back). Oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin 
      concentration changes were registered by two fNIRS channels located over the left 
      and right prefrontal cortex. Increased working-memory load resulted in worse 
      performance compared to the control condition in older adults, but not in young 
      participants. In both young and older adults, prefrontal activation increased with 
      rising working-memory load. Young adults showed slight right-hemispheric dominance 
      at low levels of working-memory load, while no hemispheric differences were apparent 
      in older adults. Analysis of the time-activation curve during the high 
      working-memory load condition revealed a continuous increase of the hemodynamic 
      response in the young. In contrast to that, a quadratic pattern of activation was 
      found in the older participants. Based on these results it could be hypothesized 
      that young adults were better able to keep the prefrontal cortex recruited over a 
      prolonged period of time. To conclude, already at low levels of working-memory load 
      do older adults recruit both hemispheres, possibly in an attempt to compensate for 
      the observed aging-related decline in performance. Also, our study shows that aging 
      effects on the time course of the hemodynamic response must be taken into account in 
      the interpretation of the results of neuroimaging studies that rely on blood oxygen 
      levels, such as fMRI.

TI  - Histamine H(3) receptor density is negatively correlated with neural activity

AB  - BACKGROUND: The histamine H(3) receptor is regarded as a drug target for cognitive 
      impairments in psychiatric disorders. H(3) receptors are expressed in neocortical 
      areas, including the prefrontal cortex, the key region of cognitive functions such 
      as working memory. However, the role of prefrontal H(3) receptors in working memory 
      has not yet been clarified. Therefore, using functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) techniques, we aimed to investigate 
      the association between the neural activity of working memory and the density of 
      H(3) receptors in the prefrontal cortex. FINDINGS: Ten healthy volunteers underwent 
      both fMRI and PET scans. The N-back task was used to assess the neural activities 
      related to working memory. H(3) receptor density was measured with the selective PET 
      radioligand [(11)C] TASP457. The neural activity of the right dorsolateral 
      prefrontal cortex during the performance of the N-back task was negatively 
      correlated with the density of H(3) receptors in this region. CONCLUSIONS: Higher 
      neural activity of working memory was associated with lower H(3) receptor density in 
      the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This finding elucidates the role of H(3) 
      receptors in working memory and indicates the potential of H(3) receptors as a 
      therapeutic target for the cognitive impairments associated with neuropsychiatric 
      disorders.

AB  - Brain phenotypes showing environmental influence may help clarify unexplained 
      associations between urban exposure and psychiatric risk. Heritable prefrontal fMRI 
      activation during working memory (WM) is such a phenotype. We hypothesized that 
      urban upbringing (childhood urbanicity) would alter this phenotype and interact with 
      dopamine genes that regulate prefrontal function during WM. Further, dopamine has 
      been hypothesized to mediate urban-associated factors like social stress. WM-related 
      prefrontal function was tested for main effects of urbanicity, main effects of three 
      dopamine genes-catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1), and 
      dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2)-and, importantly, dopamine gene-by-urbanicity 
      interactions. For COMT, three independent human samples were recruited (total n = 
      487). We also studied 253 subjects genotyped for DRD1 and DRD2. 3T fMRI activation 
      during the N-back WM task was the dependent variable, while childhood urbanicity, 
      dopamine genotype, and urbanicity-dopamine interactions were independent variables. 
      Main effects of dopamine genes and of urbanicity were found. Individuals raised in 
      an urban environment showed altered prefrontal activation relative to those raised 
      in rural or town settings. For each gene, dopamine genotype-by-urbanicity 
      interactions were shown in prefrontal cortex-COMT replicated twice in two 
      independent samples. An urban childhood upbringing altered prefrontal function and 
      interacted with each gene to alter genotype-phenotype relationships. 
      Gene-environment interactions between multiple dopamine genes and urban upbringing 
      suggest that neural effects of developmental environmental exposure could mediate, 
      at least partially, increased risk for psychiatric illness in urban environments via 
      dopamine genes expressed into adulthood.

TI  - A special role for numbers in working memory? An fMRI study.
PG  - 1-14
AB  - Although numbers carry averbal semantics (i.e., magnitude), they are often utilized 
      in verbal Working Memory (vWM) tasks. However, vWM is thought to rely on a purely 
      phonological code. Here, we tested the influence of (a) averbal semantics and (b) 
      different tasks on performance in a vWM context by examining stimulus and 
      task-specific variation of activity in the horizontal parts of the intraparietal 
      sulcus (hIPS). The hIPS has previously been shown to subserve magnitude processing 
      modulated by (a) specific stimuli and (b) specific tasks. Two variants of an n-back 
      paradigm (comparison and identity match tasks) utilizing letters and numbers as 
      stimulus material at different levels of vWM load were administered in 16 
      participants. Behavioral and functional imaging data reveal stimulus-specific 
      modulation of activity in the hIPS suggesting a semantic influence of numbers. In 
      the identity match task, numbers induced additional hIPS activation compared to 
      letters while letters never induced additional hIPS activation when compared to 
      numbers. Letters as compared to numbers only induced additional hIPS activation in 
      the comparison task. These results question the assumption of a purely phonological 
      code in vWM because hIPS activation subserving magnitude processing is modulated by 
      stimulus semantics and task demands.

TI  - Working memory capacity in schizophrenia: a parametric fMRI study.
PG  - 159-71
AB  - Impaired working memory (WM) function in schizophrenia has been associated with 
      abnormal activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). It is, however, 
      not clear whether abnormal activation is a sign of DLPFC pathology, or a correlate 
      of poor performance. We address this question by examining activity in the WM brain 
      system at different levels of task difficulty. A parametric fMRI paradigm is used to 
      examine how the WM system responds to increasing load. A parametric fMRI design with 
      four levels of a spatial N-back task was used to examine the relationships between 
      working memory load, functional output (performance) and brain activity in 10 
      schizophrenic patients on atypical antipsychotic medication and to compare these to 
      10 healthy controls. In spite of increasingly poor performance in schizophrenic 
      patients, activity increased normally in DLPFC and inferior parietal cortex 
      bilaterally and in anterior cingulate, with increasing load. At 3-back, activity 
      dropped in DLPFC in comparison with controls, but not in the other regions. The 
      results indicate that peak activation of the WM-system is reached at a lower 
      processing load in schizophrenic patients than in healthy controls. As a decline of 
      DLPFC activity at high processing loads in itself is not abnormal, WM dysfunction in 
      schizophrenia appears to be the result of an impaired functional output of the whole 
      WM system, causing elevation of the effective burden imposed by WM tasks.

TI  - Increased orbitofrontal cortex activation associated with "pro-obsessive" 
      antipsychotic treatment in patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 89-99
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with schizophrenia have an approximately 10-fold higher risk 
      for obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) than the general population. A large 
      subgroup seems to experience OCS as a consequence of second-generation antipsychotic 
      agents (SGA), such as clozapine. So far little is known about underlying neural 
      mechanisms. METHODS: To investigate the role of SGA treatment on neural processing 
      related to OCS in patients with schizophrenia, we stratified patients according to 
      their monotherapy into 2 groups (group I: clozapine or olanzapine; group II: 
      amisulpride or aripiprazole). We used an fMRI approach, applying a go/no-go task 
      assessing inhibitory control and an n-back task measuring working memory. RESULTS: 
      We enrolled 21 patients in group I and 19 patients in group II. Groups did not 
      differ regarding age, sex, education or severity of psychotic symptoms. Frequency 
      and severity of OCS were significantly higher in group I and were associated with 
      pronounced deficits in specific cognitive abilities. Whereas brain activation 
      patterns did not differ during working memory, group I showed significantly 
      increased activation in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) during response inhibition. 
      Alterations in OFC activation were associated with the severity of obsessions and 
      mediated the association between SGA treatment and co-occurring OCS on a trend 
      level. LIMITATIONS: The main limitation of this study is its cross-sectional design. 
      CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first imaging study conducted to elucidate 
      SGA effects on neural systems related to OCS. We propose that alterations in brain 
      functioning reflect a pathogenic mechanism in the development of SGA-induced OCS in 
      patients with schizophrenia. Longitudinal studies and randomized interventions are 
      needed to prove the suggested causal interrelations.

TI  - Brain activity during a post-stress working memory task differs between the 
      hormone-present and hormone-absent phase of hormonal contraception.

AB  - Taking hormonal contraceptives (HCs) affects the magnitude of the hormonal stress 
      response and cognition. HCs are usually administered in a monthly cycle with both 
      synthetic-hormone-containing and synthetic-hormone-absent phases. The synthetic 
      hormones contained in HCs affect a wide range of neurophysiological systems, 
      suggesting that effects of the medication might only be observed during the 
      synthetic-hormone-containing phase of the HC cycle. To test this, women were seen 
      twice, once during the hormone-present phase and once during the hormone-absent 
      phase of the HC cycle. In each session, women performed an n-back working memory 
      task to assess pre-stress performance outside of the magnetic resonance imaging 
      scanner, were then exposed to cold pressor stress, and again completed the n-back 
      task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The free cortisol response to 
      stress remained the same across the HC cycle. Women also performed comparably on the 
      n-back task after stress exposure across the two phases. However, despite these 
      similarities, women displayed greater disengagement of default mode network as task 
      demands increased during the hormone-present phase only, a pattern more in line with 
      working memory-related brain activation under non-stressful conditions reported in 
      other studies. The results suggest that the synthetic hormones contained in HCs may 
      mitigate stress-related disruptions of typical brain activation patterns during the 
      hormone-present phase of the HC cycle, despite exhibiting comparable cortisol 
      responses across the HC cycle. Additional research is required to determine the 
      mechanisms contributing to, and the extent of, such mitigating effects.

TI  - Increased brain activation during working memory processing after pediatric mild 
      traumatic brain injury (mTBI).
PG  - 297-308
LID - 10.3233/PRM-150348 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The neural substrate of post-concussive symptoms following the initial 
      injury period after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in pediatric populations 
      remains poorly elucidated. This study examined neuropsychological, behavioral, and 
      brain functioning in adolescents post-mTBI to assess whether persistent differences 
      were detectable up to a year post-injury. METHODS: Nineteen adolescents on average 
      7.5 months post-mTBI completed neuropsychological testing and an fMRI 
      auditory-verbal N-back working memory task. Parents completed behavioral ratings. 
      The comparison group included 19 healthy controls matched to the mTBI group for 
      demographic variables and N-back task performance. RESULTS: There were no 
      between-group differences for cognition or behavior ratings. The expected decreased 
      accuracy and increased reaction time as N-back task difficulty increased were 
      apparent. The mTBI group showed significantly greater brain activation than controls 
      during the most difficult working memory load condition. CONCLUSION: Greater working 
      memory task-related activation was found in adolescents up to one year post-mTBI 
      relative to controls, potentially indicating compensatory activation to support 
      normal task performance. Differences in brain activation in the mTBI group so long 
      after injury may indicate residual alterations in brain function much later than 
      would be expected based on the typical pattern of symptom recovery, which could have 
      important clinical implications.

AB  - The subjective experience of cognitive dysfunction ("fibrofog") is common in 
      fibromyalgia. This study investigated the relation between subjective appraisal of 
      cognitive function, objective cognitive task performance, and brain activity during 
      a cognitive task using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Sixteen 
      fibromyalgia patients and 13 healthy pain-free controls completed a battery of 
      questionnaires, including the Multiple Ability Self-Report Questionnaire (MASQ), a 
      measure of self-perceived cognitive difficulties. Participants were evaluated for 
      working memory performance using a modified N-back working memory task while 
      undergoing Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI measurements. Fibromyalgia 
      patients and controls did not differ in working memory performance. Subjective 
      appraisal of cognitive function was associated with better performance (accuracy) on 
      the working memory task in healthy controls but not in fibromyalgia patients. In 
      fibromyalgia patients, increased perceived cognitive difficulty was positively 
      correlated with the severity of their symptoms. BOLD response during the working 
      memory task did not differ between the groups. BOLD response correlated with task 
      accuracy in control subjects but not in fibromyalgia patients. Increased subjective 
      cognitive impairment correlated with decreased BOLD response in both groups but in 
      different anatomic regions. In conclusion, "fibrofog" appears to be better 
      characterized by subjective rather than objective impairment. Neurologic correlates 
      of this subjective experience of impairment might be separate from those involved in 
      the performance of cognitive tasks.

TI  - Brain activity associated with memory and cognitive function during jaw-tapping 
      movement in healthy subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether jaw-tapping movement, a classically described as an 
      indication of personal well-being and mental health, stimulates the memory and the 
      cognitive regions of the brain and is associated with improved brain performance. 
      METHODS: Twelve healthy right-handed female subjects completed the study. Each 
      patient performed a jaw-tapping task and an n-back task during functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI). The subjects were trained to carry out the jaw-tapping 
      movement at home twice a day for 4 weeks. The fMRI was repeated when they returned. 
      RESULTS: During the first and second jaw-tapping session, both sides of precentral 
      gyrus and the right middle frontal gyrus (BA 6) were activated. And during the 
      second session of the jaw-tapping task, parts of frontal lobe and temporal lobe 
      related to memory function were more activated. In addition, the total percent task 
      accuracy in n-back task significantly increased after 4 weeks of jawtapping 
      movement. After jaw-tapping training for 4 weeks, brain areas related to memory 
      showed significantly increased blood oxygen level dependent signals. CONCLUSION: 
      Jaw-tapping movement might be a useful exercise for stimulating the memory and 
      cognitive regions of the brain.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate how alcohol intoxication at two blood 
      alcohol concentrations (BAC) affected neuronal activation during increasing levels 
      of cognitive load. For this purpose we used functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) together with a working memory n-back paradigm with three levels of 
      difficulty. Twenty-five healthy male participants were scanned twice on two separate 
      days. Participants in the control group (N=13) were scanned after drinking a 
      soft-drink at both scanning sessions, while participants in the alcohol group (N=12) 
      were scanned once after drinking an alcoholic beverage resulting in a BAC of 0.02%, 
      and once after drinking an alcoholic beverage resulting in a BAC of 0.08%. A 
      decrease in neuronal activation was seen in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex 
      (dACC) and in the cerebellum in the alcohol group at the BAC of 0.08% when the 
      participants performed the most demanding task. The dACC is important in cognitive 
      control, working memory, response inhibition, decision making and in error 
      monitoring. The results have revealed that the effect of alcohol intoxication on 
      brain activity is dependent on BAC and of cognitive load.

TI  - Functional brain organization of working memory in adolescents varies in relation to 
      family income and academic achievement.
LID - 10.1111/desc.12450 [doi]
AB  - Working memory (WM) capacity reflects executive functions associated with 
      performance on a wide range of cognitive tasks and education outcomes, including 
      mathematics achievement, and is associated with dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal 
      cortices. Here we asked if family income is associated with variation in the 
      functional brain organization of WM capacity among adolescents, and whether that 
      variation is associated with performance on a statewide test of academic achievement 
      in mathematics. Participants were classified into higher-income and lower-income 
      groups based on family income, and performed a WM task with a parametric 
      manipulation of WM load (N-back task) during functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI). Behaviorally, the higher-income group had greater WM capacity and higher 
      mathematics achievement scores. Neurally, the higher-income group showed greater 
      activation as a function of WM load in bilateral prefrontal, parietal, and other 
      regions, although the lower-income group exhibited greater activation at the lowest 
      load. Both groups exhibited positive correlations between parietal activations and 
      mathematics achievement scores, but only the higher-income group exhibited a 
      positive correlation between prefrontal activations and mathematics scores. Most of 
      these findings were maintained when higher- and lower-income groups were matched on 
      WM task performance or nonverbal IQ. Findings indicate that the functional neural 
      architecture of WM varies with family income and is associated with education 
      measures of mathematics achievement.

AB  - Schizoaffective patients can have neurocognitive deficits and default mode network 
      dysfunction while being acutely ill. It remains unclear to what extent these 
      abnormalities persist when they go into clinical remission. Memory and executive 
      function were tested in 22 acutely ill schizoaffective patients; they also underwent 
      fMRI scanning during performance of the n-back working memory test. The same 
      measures were obtained after they had been in remission for ≥ 2 months. Twenty-two 
      matched healthy individuals were also examined. In clinical remission, schizomanic 
      patients showed an improvement of memory but not of executive function, while 
      schizodepressive patients did not change in either domain. All schizoaffective 
      patients in clinical remission showed memory and executive impairment compared to 
      the controls. On fMRI, acutely ill schizomanic patients had reversible frontal 
      hypo-activation when compared to clinical remission, while activation patterns in 
      ill and remitted schizodepressive patients were similar. The whole group of 
      schizoaffective patients in clinical remission showed a failure of de-activation in 
      the medial frontal gyrus compared to the healthy controls. There was evidence for 
      memory improvement and state dependent changes in activation in schizomanic patients 
      across relapse and remission. Medial frontal failure of de-activation in remitted 
      schizoaffective patients, which probably reflects default mode network dysfunction, 
      appears to be a state independent feature of the illness.

AB  - In the present study, we applied high-resolution functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) of the human auditory cortex (AC) and adjacent areas to compare 
      activations during spatial discrimination and spatial n-back memory tasks that were 
      varied parametrically in difficulty. We found that activations in the anterior 
      superior temporal gyrus (STG) were stronger during spatial discrimination than 
      during spatial memory, while spatial memory was associated with stronger activations 
      in the inferior parietal lobule (IPL). We also found that wide AC areas were 
      strongly deactivated during the spatial memory tasks. The present AC activation 
      patterns associated with spatial discrimination and spatial memory tasks were highly 
      similar to those obtained in our previous study comparing AC activations during 
      pitch discrimination and pitch memory (Rinne et al., 2009). Together our previous 
      and present results indicate that discrimination and memory tasks activate anterior 
      and posterior AC areas differently and that this anterior-posterior division is 
      present both when these tasks are performed on spatially invariant (pitch 
      discrimination vs. memory) or spatially varying (spatial discrimination vs. memory) 
      sounds. These results also further strengthen the view that activations of human AC 
      cannot be explained only by stimulus-level parameters (e.g., spatial vs. nonspatial 
      stimuli) but that the activations observed with fMRI are strongly dependent on the 
      characteristics of the behavioral task. Thus, our results suggest that in order to 
      understand the functional structure of AC a more systematic investigation of 
      task-related factors affecting AC activations is needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Impairment in working memory (WM) is a core symptom in schizophrenia. 
      However, little is known about how clinical features influence functional brain 
      activity specific to WM processing during the development of first-episode psychosis 
      (FEP) to schizophrenia (SZ). We compared functional WM-specific brain activity in 
      FEP and SZ patients, including the effects of the duration of illness, 
      psychopathological factors and antipsychotic medication. METHODS: Cross-sectional 
      study of male FEP (n=22) and SZ (n=20) patients performing an n-back task when 
      undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Clinical features were 
      collected by semi-structured interviews and medical records. RESULTS: The SZ group 
      performed significantly worse than the FEP group in the 2-back condition. The SZ 
      group also showed significantly higher activation in the left superior frontal gyrus 
      in the 2-back versus 0-back condition (2-back>0-back). This frontal activation 
      correlated positively with negative symptoms and with cumulative antipsychotic 
      medication during the year before the fMRI examination. There were no significant 
      correlations between activation and duration of illness. CONCLUSION: There was 
      greater frontal neural activation in SZ than in FEP. This indicated differences in 
      WM processing, and was significantly related to cumulative antipsychotic exposure 
      and negative symptoms, but not to the duration of illness.

AB  - Recent investigations addressing the role of the synaptic multiadaptor molecule 
      AKAP5 in human emotion and behavior suggest that the AKAP5 Pro100Leu polymorphism 
      (rs2230491) contributes to individual differences in affective control. Carriers of 
      the less common Leu allele show a higher control of anger as indicated by behavioral 
      measures and dACC brain response on emotional distracters when compared to Pro 
      homozygotes. In the current fMRI study we used an emotional working memory task 
      according to the n-back scheme with neutral and negative emotional faces as target 
      stimuli. Pro homozygotes showed a performance advantage at the behavioral level and 
      exhibited enhanced activation of the amygdala and fusiform face area during working 
      memory for emotional faces. On the other hand, Leu carriers exhibited increased 
      activation of the dACC during performance of the 2-back condition. Our results 
      suggest that AKAP5 Pro100Leu effects on emotion processing might be task-dependent 
      with Pro homozygotes showing lower control of emotional interference, but more 
      efficient processing of task-relevant emotional stimuli.

TI  - Increased neural activity during high working memory load predicts low relapse risk 
      in alcohol dependence.
PG  - 402-14
LID - 10.1111/adb.12103 [doi]
AB  - Working memory (WM) impairments are often observed in alcohol-dependent individuals, 
      especially in early abstinence, which may contribute to an increased relapse risk 
      after detoxification. Brain imaging studies on visuospatial WM in alcohol-dependent 
      patients compared to controls indicate that information processing requires 
      compensatory increased neural activation to perform at a normal level. However, to 
      date, no study tested whether such increased neural WM activation patterns or the 
      lack thereof predict relapse behavior in alcohol-dependent individuals, and whether 
      such differences persist when adequately correcting for individual grey matter 
      differences. We combined analyses of neural activation during an n-back task and 
      local grey matter volumes using Biological Parametric Mapping in 40 detoxified 
      alcohol-dependent patients and 40 matched healthy controls (HC), and assessed 
      prospective relapse risk during a 7-month follow-up period. Despite equal task 
      performance, we found increased functional activation during high versus low 
      cognitive WM load (2-back-0-back) in bilateral rostral prefrontal cortex (BA10) and 
      bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (BA45,47) in prospective abstainers versus 
      relapsers, and further in left/right lateral/medial premotor cortex (BA6,8) in 
      abstainers versus HC. In prospective abstainers, but not relapsers, subtle cognitive 
      impairment was associated with increased neural task activity in the premotor 
      cortex. These findings suggest that in prospective abstainers, higher functional 
      engagement of presumably less impaired neural resources in executive behavioral 
      control brain areas (BA10, 45, 47, 6, 8) may constitute a resilience factor 
      associated with good treatment outcome.

TI  - Effects of androgen deprivation on brain function in prostate cancer patients - a 
      prospective observational cohort analysis.
PG  - 371
LID - 10.1186/1471-2407-12-371 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite a lack of consensus regarding effectiveness, androgen 
      deprivation therapy (ADT) is a common treatment for non-metastatic, low-risk 
      prostate cancer. To examine a particular clinical concern regarding the possible 
      impact of ADT on cognition, the current study combined neuropsychological testing 
      with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess both brain activation 
      during cognitive performance as well as the integrity of brain connectivity. 
      METHODS: In a prospective observational cohort analysis of men with non-metastatic 
      prostate cancer at a Veterans Affairs medical center, patients receiving ADT were 
      compared with patients not receiving ADT at baseline and at 6 months. Assessments 
      included fMRI, the N-back task (for working memory), the stop-signal task (for 
      cognitive control), and a quality of life questionnaire. RESULTS: Among 36 patients 
      enrolled (18 in each group), 30 completed study evaluations (15 in each group); 5 
      withdrew participation and 1 died. Results for the N-back task, stop-signal task, 
      and quality of life were similar at 6 months vs. baseline in each group. In 
      contrast, statistically significant associations were found between ADT use (vs. non 
      use) and decreased medial prefrontal cortical activation during cognitive control, 
      as well as decreased connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex and other 
      regions involved with cognitive control. CONCLUSIONS: Although ADT for 6 months did 
      not affect selected tests of cognitive function, brain activations during cognitive 
      control and functional brain connectivity were impaired on fMRI. The long-term 
      clinical implications of these changes are not known and warrant future study.

PG  - 14108-14

AB  - Substantial neuroimaging evidence suggests that spontaneous engagement of the 
      default network impairs performance on tasks requiring executive control. We 
      investigated whether this impairment depends on the congruence between executive 
      control demands and internal mentation. We hypothesized that activation of the 
      default network might enhance performance on an executive control task if control 
      processes engage long-term memory representations that are supported by the default 
      network. Using fMRI, we scanned 36 healthy young adult humans on a novel two-back 
      task requiring working memory for famous and anonymous faces. In this task, 
      participants (1) matched anonymous faces interleaved with anonymous face, (2) 
      matched anonymous faces interleaved with a famous face, or (3) matched a famous 
      faces interleaved with an anonymous face. As predicted, we observed a facilitation 
      effect when matching famous faces, compared with anonymous faces. We also observed 
      greater activation of the default network during these famous face-matching trials. 
      The results suggest that activation of the default network can contribute to task 
      performance during an externally directed executive control task. Our findings 
      provide evidence that successful activation of the default network in a contextually 
      relevant manner facilitates goal-directed cognition.

TI  - Cholinergic blockade under working memory demands encountered by increased rehearsal 
      strategies: evidence from fMRI in healthy subjects.
PG  - 329-39
LID - 10.1007/s00406-011-0267-6 [doi]
AB  - The connection between cholinergic transmission and cognitive performance has been 
      established in behavioural studies. The specific contribution of the muscarinic 
      receptor system on cognitive performance and brain activation, however, has not been 
      evaluated satisfyingly. To investigate the specific contribution of the muscarinic 
      transmission on neural correlates of working memory, we examined the effects of 
      scopolamine, an antagonist of the muscarinic receptors, using functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI). Fifteen healthy male, non-smoking subjects performed a 
      fMRI scanning session following the application of scopolamine (0.4 mg, i.v.) or 
      saline in a placebo-controlled, repeated measure, pseudo-randomized, single-blind 
      design. Working memory was probed using an n-back task. Compared to placebo, 
      challenging the cholinergic transmission with scopolamine resulted in 
      hypoactivations in parietal, occipital and cerebellar areas and hyperactivations in 
      frontal and prefrontal areas. These alterations are interpreted as compensatory 
      strategies used to account for downregulation due to muscarinic acetylcholine 
      blockade in parietal and cerebral storage systems by increased activation in frontal 
      and prefrontal areas related to working memory rehearsal. Our results further 
      underline the importance of cholinergic transmission to working memory performance 
      and determine the specific contribution of muscarinic transmission on cerebral 
      activation associated with executive functioning.

TI  - Prenatal tobacco exposure predicts differential brain function during working memory 
      in early adolescence: a preliminary investigation.

AB  - Children prenatally exposed to tobacco exhibit higher rates of learning and 
      emotional-behavioral problems related to worse working memory performance. Brain 
      function, however, among tobacco exposed children while performing a working memory 
      task has not previously been examined. This study compared the brain function of 
      tobacco-exposed (n = 7) and unexposed (n = 11) 12-year-olds during a number N-back 
      working memory task using an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) design. Prenatal alcohol exposure, neonatal medical problems, environmental 
      risk, and sex were statistically controlled. Tobacco-exposed children showed greater 
      activation in inferior parietal regions, whereas unexposed children showed greater 
      activation in inferior frontal regions. These differences were observed in the 
      context of correct responses, suggesting that exposed and unexposed children use 
      different brain regions and approaches to succeed in working memory tasks. 
      Implications for future research and intervention are discussed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cognitive deficits are a side-effect of chemotherapy, however 
      pre-treatment research is limited. This study examines neurofunctional differences 
      during working memory between breast cancer (BC) patients and controls, prior to 
      chemotherapy. METHODS: Early stage BC females (23), scanned after surgery but before 
      chemotherapy, were individually matched to non-cancer controls. Participants 
      underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a 
      Visuospatial N-back task and data was analyzed by multiple group comparisons. fMRI 
      task performance, neuropsychological tests, hospital records, and salivary 
      biomarkers were also collected. RESULTS: There were no significant group differences 
      on neuropsychological tests, estrogen, or cortisol. Patients made significantly 
      fewer commission errors but had less overall correct responses and were slower than 
      controls during the task. Significant group differences were observed for the fMRI 
      data, yet results depended on the type of analysis. BC patients presented with 
      increased activations during working memory compared to controls in areas such as 
      the inferior frontal gyrus, insula, thalamus, and midbrain. Individual group 
      regressions revealed a reverse relationship between brain activity and commission 
      errors. CONCLUSION: This is the first fMRI investigation to reveal 
      neurophysiological differences during visuospatial working memory between BC 
      patients pre-chemotherapy and controls. These results also increase the knowledge 
      about the effects of BC and related factors on the working memory network. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: This highlights the need to better understand the pre-chemotherapy BC 
      patient and the effects of associated confounding variables.

TI  - A longitudinal fMRI study of working memory in severe TBI patients with diffuse 
      axonal injury.
PG  - 421-9

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients have working memory deficits and altered 
      patterns of brain activation during this function. The evolution of the impairment 
      has not been examined to date. This study investigated longitudinal changes in brain 
      activation during a working memory task. Twelve patients with severe and diffuse TBI 
      and ten healthy matched controls were fMRI scanned twice at a 6-month interval 
      during an n-back task (0-, 2- and 3-back). All the TBI patients selected presented 
      signs of diffuse axonal injury on CT but had no evidence of focal lesions on MRI 
      clinical examination. Significant changes in brain activation over time were 
      observed in patients, but not in controls. During the first examination, though both 
      groups engaged bilateral fronto-parietal regions known to be involved in working 
      memory, activation of the right superior frontal gyrus was low in the TBI group. 
      However, the difference between TBI and controls had decreased significantly after 6 
      months. A factor analysis confirmed the greater increase in activation in the right 
      superior frontal cortex in the TBI group than in healthy controls, leading to 
      normalization of the brain activation pattern. In conclusion, this longitudinal 
      study provides evidence of a progressive normalization of the working memory 
      activation pattern after diffuse axonal injury in severe TBI, coinciding with an 
      improvement in performance on this function.

TI  - Estradiol treatment altered anticholinergic-related brain activation during working

AB  - Estradiol has been shown to affect cholinergic modulation of cognition in human and 
      nonhuman animal models. This study examined the brain-based interaction of estradiol 
      treatment and anticholinergic challenge in postmenopausal women during the 
      performance of a working memory task and functional MRI. Twenty-four postmenopausal 
      women were randomly and blindly placed on 1mg oral 17-β estradiol or matching 
      placebo pills for three months after which they participated in three 
      anticholinergic challenge sessions. During the challenge sessions, subjects were 
      administered the antimuscarinic drug scopolamine, the antinicotinic drug 
      mecamylamine, or placebo. After drug administration, subjects completed an fMRI 
      session during which time they performed a visual verbal N-back test of working 
      memory. Results showed that scopolamine increased activation in the left medial 
      frontal gyrus (BA 10) and mecamylamine increased activation in the left inferior 
      frontal gyrus (BA 46). Estradiol treatment compared to placebo treatment 
      significantly reduced the activation in this left medial frontal region during 
      scopolamine challenge. Estradiol treatment also increased activation in the 
      precuneus (BA 31) during mecamylamine challenge. These data are the first to show 
      that estradiol modulated antimuscarinic- and anitnicotinic-induced brain activity 
      and suggest that estradiol affected cholinergic system regulation of 
      cognition-related brain activation in humans.

TI  - Neural correlates of working memory in pure and polyvalent ecstasy (MDMA) users.
PG  - 1983-7
AB  - Poor cognitive performance in ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; MDMA) 
      users has been related to the well-recognized neurotoxic effects of the drug upon 
      central serotonergic and possibly also dopaminergic systems. However, concomitant 
      use of other drugs has been a critical confound in most investigations. In this 
      study we used an n-back task and fMRI to investigate working memory performance and 
      related cerebral activation in eight, currently abstinent pure MDMA users and two 
      matched groups of polyvalent MDMA users and non-users. Pure MDMA users presented 
      lower activations than controls and/or polyvalent users, most notably in inferior 
      temporal regions, the angular gyrus and the striate cortex, whereas polyvalent users 
      did not differ from controls. Our results suggest that altered brain activation 
      patterns during cognitive processing in ecstasy users may be mainly associated with 
      prior MDMA use. Concomitant use of other drugs may modify this effect.

TI  - The effects of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) treatment on brain function in individuals 
      with phenylketonuria.
PG  - 539-47
LID - 10.1016/j.nicl.2013.08.012 [doi]
AB  - Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare genetic condition characterized by an absence or 
      mutation of the PAH enzyme, which is necessary for the metabolism of the amino acid 
      phenylalanine into tyrosine. Recently, sapropterin dihydrochloride, a synthetic form 
      of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), has been introduced as a supplemental treatment to 
      dietary phe control for PKU. Very little is known regarding BH4 treatment and its 
      effect on brain and cognition. The present study represents the first examination of 
      potential changes in neural activation in patients with PKU during BH4 treatment. To 
      this end, we utilized an n-back working memory task in conjunction with functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate functional brain integrity in a sample 
      of individuals with PKU at three timepoints: Just prior to BH4 treatment, after 
      4 weeks of treatment, and after 6 months of treatment. Neural activation patterns 
      observed for the PKU treatment group were compared with those of a 
      demographically-matched sample of healthy non-PKU individuals who were assessed at 
      identical time intervals. Consistent with past research, baseline evaluation 
      revealed impaired working memory and atypical brain activation in the PKU group as 
      compared to the non-PKU group. Most importantly, BH4 treatment was associated with 
      improvements in both working memory and brain activation, with neural changes 
      evident earlier (4-week timepoint) than changes in working memory performance 
      (6-month timepoint).

AB  - Impaired hippocampal function is believed to be important in the pathogenesis of 
      depression. The hippocampus contains a high concentration of both mineralocorticoid 
      (MR) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR), and the experimental administration of 
      corticosteroids has been reported to mimic memory impairments seen in depression. 
      Using pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) we investigated 
      whether hippocampal function is altered after acute administration of 
      hydrocortisone. Changes in BOLD signal following infusion of 100mg hydrocortisone 
      given as a rapid intravenous bolus were measured in 14 healthy volunteers in a 
      within-subject placebo-controlled crossover design. Subsequently, subjects completed 
      an n-back task during an fMRI scan. Hydrocortisone infusion caused a significant, 
      time-dependent increase in fMRI BOLD signal in hippocampus reaching a maximal effect 
      at 11-19min. The n-back task increased BOLD signal in prefrontal and parietal 
      cortical areas and decreased it in the hippocampus. After hydrocortisone the left 
      hippocampal decrease in BOLD signal was attenuated with the magnitude of attenuation 
      correlating with the increase seen after hydrocortisone infusion. No difference in 
      behavioural task performance was observed. The results suggest acute hydrocortisone 
      has rapid direct and modulatory influences on hippocampal function, probably acting 
      through non-genomic GR or MR signalling. Hydrocortisone infusion phMRI may be a 
      useful tool to investigate hippocampal corticosteroid receptor function in 
      depression.

TI  - Functional MRI in NPSLE patients reveals increased parietal and frontal brain 
      activation during a working memory task compared with controls.
PG  - 50-3
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Anatomical MRI brain scans may not reflect neurological dysfunction in 
      patients with NPSLE. We used blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI) 
      to investigate working memory function in NPSLE patients. METHODS: Twenty-seven 
      females took part: nine NPSLE patients (mean age 40 yrs; SLEDAI 10.9); nine RA 
      patients and nine healthy controls. Subjects were tested using the n-back paradigm 
      for working memory, where patients indicate when a stimulus matches one presented n 
      trials previously. Functional scans used 3 mm slices x 30, repetition time 2570 ms, 
      echo time 50 ms. Echo planar images were superimposed onto T1w anatomical images 
      (Siemens 1.5 T). Data analysis used Brain Voyager QX Version 1.7. RESULTS: During 
      the memory task, there was activation in areas serving working memory, executive 
      function and attention in all groups. Nine regions of interest were selected for 
      activation during working memory (N-back task vs fixation, P < or = 0.005). In six 
      out of nine regions, there was greater activation in the NPSLE group. This reached 
      significance in three regions: the posterior inferior parietal lobules of both 
      hemispheres [Brodmann area (BA) 7] separately and combined (P = 0.014, 0.016 and 
      0.004, respectively), and the supplementary motor area (mid-line frontal lobe) 
      (BA32/6; P = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: NPSLE patients showed greater frontoparietal 
      activation than the other groups during the memory task, suggesting a greater need 
      to recruit extra cortical pathways, possibly to supplement impaired function of 
      standard pathways.

TI  - Functional imaging studies of cognition using 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT: empirical 
      validation using the n-back working memory paradigm.
PG  - 695-703
LID - 10.1007/s00259-007-0635-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Functional activation protocols are widely applied for the study of 
      brain-cognition relations. Only few take advantage of the intrinsic characteristics 
      of SPECT, particularly those allowing cognitive assessment outside of the camera, in 
      settings close to the standard clinical or laboratory ones. The purpose of the study 
      was to assess the feasibility of a split-dose activation protocol with (99m)Tc-HMPAO 
      using low irradiation dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A two-scans protocol was applied 
      to 12 healthy young volunteers using 270 MBq of (99m)Tc-HMPAO per scan, with each 
      image associated to a particular experimental condition of the verbal n-back working 
      memory task (0-back, 2-back). Subtraction method was used to identify regional brain 
      activity related to the task. RESULTS: Voxel-wise statistical analysis showed left 
      lateralized activity associated with the 2-back task, compared to the 0-back task. 
      Activated regions, mainly prefrontal and parietal, were similar to those observed in 
      previous fMRI and (15)O-PET studies. CONCLUSION: The results support the use of 
      (99m)Tc-HMPAO SPECT for the investigation of brain-cognition relations and 
      demonstrate the feasibility of optimal quality images despite low 
      radiopharmaceutical doses. The findings also acknowledge the use of HMPAO as a 
      radioligand to capture neuro-energetic modulations linked to cognitive activity. 
      They encourage extending the application of the described activation protocol to 
      clinical populations.

TI  - Neural representation of binding lexical signs and words in the episodic buffer of 
      working memory.
PG  - 2258-76
AB  - The episodic buffer accommodates formation and maintenance of unitary 
      multidimensional representations based on information in different codes from 
      different sources. Formation, based on submorphemic units, engages posterior brain 
      regions, while maintenance engages frontal regions. Using a hybrid fMRI design, that 
      allows separate analysis of transient and sustained components, an n-back task and 
      an experimental group of 13 hearing native signers, with experience of Swedish Sign 
      Language and Swedish since birth, we investigated binding of lexical signs and words 
      in working memory. Results show that the transient component of these functions is 
      supported by a buffer-specific network of posterior regions including the right 
      middle temporal lobe, possibly relating to binding of phonological loop 
      representations with semantic representations in long-term memory, as well as a 
      loop-specific network, in line with predictions of a functional relationship between 
      loop and buffer. The left hippocampus was engaged in transient and sustained 
      components of buffer processing, possibly reflecting the meaningful nature of the 
      stimuli. Only a minor role was found for executive functions in line with other 
      recent work. A novel representation of the sustained component of working memory for 
      audiovisual language in the right inferior temporal lobe may be related to 
      perception of speech-related facial gestures. Previous findings of sign and speech 
      loop representation in working memory were replicated and extended. Together, these 
      findings support the notion of a module that mediates between codes and sources, 
      such as the episodic buffer, and further our understanding of its nature.

      in bipolar disorder.
PG  - 605-15
LID - 10.3109/15622975.2011.585662 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Emotional dysregulation in bipolar disorder is thought to arise from 
      dysfunction within prefrontal cortical regions involved in cognitive control coupled 
      with increased or aberrant activation within regions engaged in emotional 
      processing. The aim of this study was to determine the common and distinct patterns 
      of functional brain abnormalities during reward and working memory processing in 
      patients with bipolar disorder. METHODS: Participants were 36 euthymic bipolar 
      disorder patients and 37 healthy comparison subjects matched for age, sex and IQ. 
      Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was conducted during the Iowa Gambling 
      Task (IGT) and the n-back working memory task. RESULTS: During both tasks, patients 
      with bipolar disorder demonstrated a pattern of inefficient engagement within the 
      ventral frontopolar prefrontal cortex with evidence of segregation along the 
      medial-lateral dimension for reward and working memory processing, respectively. 
      Moreover, patients also showed greater activation in the anterior cingulate cortex 
      during the Iowa Gambling Task and in the insula during the n-back task. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our data implicate ventral frontopolar dysfunction as a core abnormality 
      underpinning bipolar disorder and confirm that overactivation in regions involved in 
      emotional arousal is present even in tasks that do not typically engage emotional 
      systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, we reported a significantly negative association of 
      cyclothymic temperament scores with activations of the left lingual gyrus during 
      esthetic judgments of paintings, suggesting that cyclothymic temperament may be 
      associated with the left lingual gyrus. In view of potential associations of 
      cyclothymic temperament, bipolar disorder and dementia, this study examined the 
      relationship of temperament to lingual gyrus activity using a working memory task as 
      a new context. METHODS: N-back tasks (0-, 1-, 2- and 3-back tasks) were performed on 
      34 healthy subjects using functional MRI. Multiple regression analyses were applied 
      to measure the association between cyclothymic temperament scores and each of 4 beta 
      images corresponding to 0-, 1-, 2- and 3-back tasks with gender, age and the other 
      temperament scores (depressive, hyperthymic, irritable and anxious) as covariates. 
      RESULTS: The whole brain analysis corrected for multiple comparisons revealed a 
      significant activation of the left lingual gyrus associated with cyclothymic 
      temperament scores in a new context-working memory for both 2- and 3-back tasks. 
      LIMITATIONS: The number of subjects was relatively small. The subjects were almost 
      medical staff or students and the results should be interpreted with caution. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The present findings reconfirm that cyclothymic temperament may be 
      associated with the left lingual gyrus.

TI  - Effects of acute smoking on brain activity vary with abstinence in smokers 
      performing the N-Back task: a preliminary study.
PG  - 103-9
AB  - We previously reported that compared with a non-deprivation state, overnight 
      abstinence from cigarette smoking was associated with higher brain activity in the 
      left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) during a low demanding working memory 
      challenge, and little increase beyond this activity level during more taxing working 
      memory conditions. In the present study, we aimed to assess how recent smoking 
      (overnight abstinence vs. smoking ad libitum) influenced the effect of smoking a 
      cigarette on brain activity related to a working memory challenge. Six smokers 
      performed the N-Back working memory task during functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) both before and after smoking a cigarette in each of two test 
      sessions: one following overnight abstinence from smoking ( approximately 13 h) and 
      the other following ad libitum smoking. Task-related activity in L-DLPFC showed a 
      significant interaction between the effects of acute smoking, test session, and task 
      load. After overnight abstinence, post-smoking brain activity in L-DLPFC was lower 
      than before smoking at low task load and higher at high task load; corresponding 
      activity on a day of ad libitum smoking was higher at low load and lower at high 
      task load after smoking during the session. These data suggest that the effect of 
      acute smoking on working memory processing depends on recent prior smoking and task 
      load. In particular, they provide preliminary evidence that functional efficiency of 
      working memory is improved by smoking a cigarette during abstinence, while the 
      effect of a cigarette in a non-deprived state varies with the nature and difficulty 
      of the working memory challenge. This interaction merits further examination in 
      larger studies specifically designed to consider this issue.

AB  - Working memory (WM) performance declines with age. However, several studies have 
      shown that WM training may lead to performance increases not only in the trained 
      task, but also in untrained cognitive transfer tasks. It has been suggested that 
      transfer effects occur if training task and transfer task share specific processing 
      components that are supposedly processed in the same brain areas. In the current 
      study, we investigated whether single-task WM training and training-related 
      alterations in neural activity might support performance in a dual-task setting, 
      thus assessing transfer effects to higher-order control processes in the context of 
      dual-task coordination. A sample of older adults (age 60-72) was assigned to either 
      a training or control group. The training group participated in 12 sessions of an 
      adaptive n-back training. At pre and post-measurement, a multimodal dual-task was 
      performed in all participants to assess transfer effects. This task consisted of two 
      simultaneous delayed match to sample WM tasks using two different stimulus 
      modalities (visual and auditory) that were performed either in isolation 
      (single-task) or in conjunction (dual-task). A subgroup also participated in 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the performance of the n-back 
      task before and after training. While no transfer to single-task performance was 
      found, dual-task costs in both the visual modality (p < 0.05) and the auditory 
      modality (p < 0.05) decreased at post-measurement in the training but not in the 
      control group. In the fMRI subgroup of the training participants, neural activity 
      changes in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during one-back predicted 
      post-training auditory dual-task costs, while neural activity changes in right DLPFC 
      during three-back predicted visual dual-task costs. Results might indicate an 
      improvement in central executive processing that could facilitate both WM and 
      dual-task coordination.

TI  - Modeling distinct imaging hemodynamics early after TBI: the relationship between 
      signal amplitude and connectivity.
PG  - 285-301
LID - 10.1007/s11682-014-9306-z [doi]
AB  - Over the past decade, fMRI studies of cognitive change following traumatic brain 
      injury (TBI) have investigated blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activity during 
      working memory (WM) performance in individuals in early and chronic phases of 
      recovery. Recently, BOLD fMRI work has largely shifted to focus on WM and resting 
      functional connectivity following TBI. However, fundamental questions in WM remain. 
      Specifically, the effects of injury on the basic relationships between local and 
      interregional functional neuroimaging signals during WM processing early following 
      moderate to severe TBI have not been examined. This study employs a mixed effects 
      model to examine prefrontal cortex and parietal lobe signal change during a WM task, 
      the n-back, and whether there is covariance between regions of high amplitude signal 
      change, (synchrony of elicited activity (SEA) very early following TBI. We also 
      examined whether signal change and SEA differentially predict performance during WM. 
      Overall, percent signal change in the right prefrontal cortex (rPFC) was and 
      important predictor of both reaction time (RT) and SEA in early TBI and matched 
      controls. Right prefrontal cortex (rPFC) percent signal change positively predicted 
      SEA within and between persons regardless of injury status, suggesting that the link 
      between these neurodynamic processes in WM-activated regions remains unaffected even 
      very early after TBI. Additionally, rPFC activity was positively related to RT 
      within and between persons in both groups. Right parietal (rPAR) activity was 
      negatively related to RT within subjects in both groups. Thus, the local signal 
      intensity of the rPFC in TBI appears to be a critical property of network 
      functioning and performance in WM processing and may be a precursor to recruitment 
      observed in chronic samples. The present results suggest that as much research moves 
      toward large scale functional connectivity modeling, it will be essential to develop 
      integrated models of how local and distant neurodynamics promote WM performance 
      after TBI.

TI  - Evidence for structural and functional abnormality in the subgenual anterior 
      cingulate cortex in major depressive disorder.
PG  - 3263-73
LID - 10.1017/S0033291714000841 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) is considered to be an 
      important site of abnormality in major depressive disorder. However, structural 
      alterations in this region have not been a consistent finding and functional imaging 
      studies have also implicated additional areas. METHOD: A total of 32 patients with 
      major depressive disorder, currently depressed, and 64 controls underwent structural 
      imaging with MRI. Also, 26 patients and 52 controls were examined using functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during performance of the n-back working memory 
      task. Structural and functional changes were evaluated using whole-brain, 
      voxel-based methods. RESULTS: The depressed patients showed volume reductions in the 
      sgACC and orbitofrontal cortex bilaterally, plus in both temporal poles and the 
      hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus on the left. Functional imaging revealed 
      task-related hypo-activation in the left lateral prefrontal cortex and other 
      regions, as well as failure of deactivation in a subcallosal medial frontal cortical 
      area which included the sgACC. CONCLUSIONS: Whole-brain, voxel-based analysis finds 
      evidence of both structural and functional abnormality in the sgACC in major 
      depressive disorder. The fact that the functional changes in this area took the form 
      of failure of deactivation adds to previous findings of default mode network 
      dysfunction in the disorder.

TI  - Prolonged reaction time to a verbal working memory task predicts increased power of 
      posterior parietal cortical activation.
PG  - 495-503
AB  - We used multislice functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the 
      association between behavioral and neurophysiological measures of working memory 
      task performance in 20 right-handed male healthy volunteers. Images were acquired 
      over a 5-min period at 1.5 Tesla. We used a periodic design, alternating 30-s blocks 
      of the "n-back" working memory task with 30-s blocks of a sensorimotor control task 
      to activate verbal working memory systems. The power of functional response to the 
      task was estimated by sinusoidal regression at each voxel. The relationship between 
      power of fMRI response and mean reaction time over all 11 working memory trials was 
      explored by multiple regression, with age and mean reaction time to the control task 
      as covariates, at voxel and regional levels of analysis. All subjects were able to 
      perform the n-back task accurately. A spatially distributed network was activated, 
      including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, lateral premotor 
      cortex, and supplementary motor area (SMA) in the frontal lobes. More posteriorly, 
      there were major foci of activation in parietal and occipitoparietal cortex, 
      precuneus, lingual, and fusiform gyri of the ventral occipital lobe, inferior 
      temporal gyrus, and cerebellum. The power of functional response was positively 
      correlated with reaction time in bilateral posterior parietal cortex (Talairach 
      coordinates in x, y, z (mm) 35, -44, 37 and -32, -56, 42), indicating that subjects 
      who found the task difficult, and responded with a slower reaction time, tended to 
      activate these regions more powerfully. One interpretation of this regionally 
      specific relationship between prolonged reaction time and increased power of 
      posterior parietal activation is consistent with prior studies identifying similar 
      areas of parietal cortex as the site of the phonological storage function in verbal 
      working memory.

TI  - Differential working memory load effects after mild traumatic brain injury.
PG  - 1004-12
AB  - The objective of this study was to explore the effects of increasing working memory 
      (WM) processing load on previously observed abnormalities in activation of WM 
      circuitry shortly after mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). Brain activation 
      patterns in response to increasing WM processing load (auditory n-back: 0-, 1-, 2-, 
      and 3-back conditions) were assessed with fMRI in 18 MTBI patients within 1 month of 
      their injury and in 12 healthy controls. Performance accuracy on these tasks was 
      also measured. Brain activation patterns differed between MTBI patients and controls 
      in response to increasing WM processing loads. Controls maintained their ability to 
      increase activation in regions of WM circuitry with each increase in WM processing 
      load. MTBI patients showed disproportionately increased activation during the 
      moderate processing load condition, but very little increase in activation 
      associated with the highest processing load condition. Task performance did not 
      differ significantly between groups on any task condition. MTBI patients showed a 
      different pattern of allocation of processing resources associated with a high 
      processing load condition compared to healthy controls, despite similar task 
      performance. This suggests that injury-related changes in ability to activate or 
      modulate WM processing resources might underlie some of the memory complaints after 
      MTBI.

TI  - Does the default-mode functional connectivity of the brain correlate with 
      working-memory performances?
PG  - 11-20
AB  - The "default-mode" network is an ensemble of cortical regions that are typically 
      deactivated during demanding cognitive tasks in functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) studies. Using functional connectivity analysis, this network can be 
      studied as a "stand-alone" brain system whose functional role is supposed to consist 
      in the dynamic control of intrinsic processing activities like attention focusing 
      and task-unrelated thought generation and suppression. Independent component 
      analysis (ICA) is the method of choice for generating a statistical image of the 
      "default-mode" network (DMN) using a task- and seed-independent distributed model of 
      fMRI functional connectivity without prior specification of node region extent and 
      timing of neural activation. We used a standard graded working-memory task (n-back) 
      to induce fMRI changes in the default-mode regions and ICA to evaluate to DMN 
      functional connectivity in nineteen healthy volunteers. Based on the known spatial 
      variability of the ICA-DMN maps with the task difficulty levels, we hypothesized the 
      ICA-DMN may also correlate with the subject performances. We confirmed that the 
      relative extent of the anterior and posterior midline spots within the DMN were 
      oppositely (resp. positively in the anterior and negatively in the posterior 
      cingulate cortex) correlated with the level of task difficulty and found out that 
      the spatial distribution of DMN also correlates with the individual task 
      performances. We conclude that the working-memory function is related to a spatial 
      re-configuration of the DMN functional connectivity, and that the relative 
      involvement of the cingulate regions within the DMN might function as a novel 
      predictor of the working-memory efficiency.

AB  - We investigated whether intensive computerized cognitive training in schizophrenia 
      could improve working memory performance and increase signal efficiency of 
      associated middle frontal gyri (MFG) circuits in a functionally meaningful manner. 
      Thirty schizophrenia participants and 13 healthy comparison participants underwent 
      fMRI scanning during a letter N-back working memory task. Schizophrenia participants 
      were then randomly assigned to either 80 h (16 weeks) of cognitive training or a 
      computer games control condition. After this intervention, participants completed a 
      second fMRI N-back scanning session. At baseline, during 2-back working memory 
      trials, healthy participants showed the largest and most significant activation in 
      bilateral MFG, which correlated with task performance. Schizophrenia participants 
      showed impaired working memory, hypoactivation in left MFG, and no correlation 
      between bilateral MFG signal and task performance. After training, schizophrenia 
      participants improved their 2-back working memory performance and showed increased 
      activation in left MFG. They also demonstrated a significant association between 
      enhanced task performance and right MFG signal, similar to healthy participants. 
      Both task performance and brain activity in right MFG after training predicted 
      better generalized working memory at 6-month follow-up. Furthermore, task 
      performance and brain activity within bilateral MFG predicted better occupational 
      functioning at 6-month follow-up. No such findings were observed in the computer 
      games control participants. Working memory impairments in schizophrenia and its 
      underlying neural correlates in MFG can be improved by intensive computerized 
      cognitive training; these improvements generalize beyond the trained task and are 
      associated with enduring effects on cognition and functioning 6 months after the 
      intervention.

AB  - We used fMRI to investigate activations within human auditory cortex (AC) to vowels 
      during vowel discrimination, vowel (categorical n-back) memory, and visual tasks. 
      Based on our previous studies, we hypothesized that the vowel discrimination task 
      would be associated with increased activations in the anterior superior temporal 
      gyrus (STG), while the vowel memory task would enhance activations in the posterior 
      STG and inferior parietal lobule (IPL). In particular, we tested the hypothesis that 
      activations in the IPL during vowel memory tasks are associated with categorical 
      processing. Namely, activations due to categorical processing should be higher 
      during tasks performed on nonphonemic (hard to categorize) than on phonemic (easy to 
      categorize) vowels. As expected, we found distinct activation patterns during vowel 
      discrimination and vowel memory tasks. Further, these task-dependent activations 
      were different during tasks performed on phonemic or nonphonemic vowels. However, 
      activations in the IPL associated with the vowel memory task were not stronger 
      during nonphonemic than phonemic vowel blocks. Together these results demonstrate 
      that activations in human AC to vowels depend on both the requirements of the 
      behavioral task and the phonemic status of the vowels.

TI  - The effect of body posture on cognitive performance: a question of sleep quality.
PG  - 171
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00171 [doi]
LID - 171
AB  - Nearly all functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies are conducted in the 
      supine body posture, which has been discussed as a potential confounder of such 
      examinations. The literature suggests that cognitive functions, such as problem 
      solving or perception, differ between supine and upright postures. However, the 
      effect of posture on many cognitive functions is still unknown. Therefore, the aim 
      of the present study was to investigate the effects of body posture (supine vs. 
      sitting) on one of the most frequently used paradigms in the cognitive sciences: the 
      N-back working memory paradigm. Twenty-two subjects were investigated in a 
      randomized within-subject design. Subjects performed the N-back task on two 
      consecutive days in either the supine or the upright posture. Subjective sleep 
      quality and chronic stress were recorded as covariates. Furthermore, changes in mood 
      dimensions and heart rate variability (HRV) were assessed during the experiment. 
      Results indicate that the quality of sleep strongly affects reaction times when 
      subjects performed a working memory task in a supine posture. These effects, 
      however, could not be observed in the sitting position. The findings can be 
      explained by HRV parameters that indicated differences in autonomic regulation in 
      the upright vs. the supine posture. The finding is of particular relevance for fMRI 
      group comparisons when group differences in sleep quality cannot be ruled out.

TI  - Emotion perception and executive control interact in the salience network during 
      emotionally charged working memory processing.
PG  - 5606-16
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22573 [doi]
AB  - Processing of emotional stimuli can either hinder or facilitate ongoing working 
      memory (WM); however, the neural basis of these effects remains largely unknown. 
      Here we examined the neural mechanisms of these paradoxical effects by implementing 
      a novel emotional WM task in an fMRI study. Twenty-five young healthy participants 
      performed an N-back task with fearful and neutral faces as stimuli. Participants 
      made more errors when performing 0-back task with fearful versus neutral faces, 
      whereas they made fewer errors when performing 2-back task with fearful versus 
      neutral faces. These emotional impairment and enhancement on behavioral performance 
      paralleled significant interactions in distributed regions in the salience network 
      including anterior insula (AI) and dorsal cingulate cortex (dACC), as well as in 
      emotion perception network including amygdala and temporal-occipital association 
      cortex (TOC). The dorsal AI (dAI) and dACC were more activated when comparing 
      fearful with neutral faces in 0-back task. Contrarily, dAI showed reduced 
      activation, while TOC and amygdala showed stronger responses to fearful as compared 
      to neutral faces in the 2-back task. These findings provide direct neural evidence 
      to the emerging dual competition model suggesting that the salience network plays a 
      critical role in mediating interaction between emotion perception and executive 
      control when facing ever-changing behavioral demands.

TI  - Impaired working-memory after cerebellar infarcts paralleled by changes in BOLD 
      signal of a cortico-cerebellar circuit.
PG  - 2016-24
AB  - A considerable body of evidence supports the notion that cerebellar lesions lead to 
      neuropsychological deficits, including impairments in working-memory, executive 
      tasks and verbal fluency. Studies employing functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) and anatomical tracing in primates provide evidence for a cortico-cerebellar 
      circuitry as the functional substrate of working-memory. The present fMRI study 
      explores the activation pattern during an n-back working-memory task in patients 
      with an isolated cerebellar infarct. To determine each patient's cognitive 
      impairment, neuropsychological tests of working-memory and attention were carried 
      out. We conducted fMRI in nine patients and nine healthy age-matched controls while 
      they performed a 2-back task in a blocked-design. In both groups we found bilateral 
      activations in a widespread cortico-cerebellar network, consisting of the 
      ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 44, 45), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 9, 
      46), parietal cortex (BA 7, 40), pre-supplementary motor area (BA 6) anterior 
      cingulate (BA 32). Relative to healthy controls, patients with isolated cerebellar 
      infarcts demonstrated significantly more pronounced BOLD-activations in the 
      precuneus and the angular gyrus during the 2-back task. The significant increase in 
      activation in the posterior parietal areas of the cerebellar patients could be 
      attributed to a compensatory recruitment to maintain task performance. We conclude 
      that cerebellar lesions affect remote cortical regions that are part of a putative 
      cortico-cerebellar network.

TI  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging assessment of cognitive function in 
      childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus: a pilot study.
PG  - 4151-63
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate changes in brain activation patterns detected by 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), and the relationship between FMRI 
      activation patterns and results of formal neuropsychological testing, in patients 
      with childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Ten patients with 
      childhood-onset SLE underwent formal neuropsychological testing and FMRI using 3 
      paradigms: a continuous performance task (CPT) to evaluate attention, an N-Back task 
      to assess working memory, and verb generation to evaluate language processing. 
      Composite Z maps were generated to summarize the brain activation patterns for each 
      FMRI paradigm in patients with childhood-onset SLE and to compare these patterns 
      with those observed in healthy controls. Between-group comparison Z maps showing 
      differences in activation between childhood-onset SLE patients and controls were 
      generated, using a significance level of P < 0.05 in a general linear model. 
      RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the childhood-onset SLE group showed 
      statistically significant increased activation of brain areas involved in the CPT, 
      N-Back, and verb generation tasks. In contrast, in the absence of active stimulus, 
      e.g., during times of the paradigm control tasks, childhood-onset SLE patients 
      consistently undersuppressed activity in the expected brain areas. Activation in 
      selected cortical areas was found to correlate negatively with results of a subset 
      of individual neuropsychological test scores. CONCLUSION: FMRI abnormalities are 
      present in childhood-onset SLE, manifesting as an imbalance between active and 
      inhibitory responses to an array of stimuli. Differences in brain activation 
      patterns compared with those observed in controls suggest that childhood-onset SLE 
      may be associated with abnormalities in white matter connectivity resulting in 
      neuronal network dysfunction, rather than injury of specific gray matter areas.

TI  - Gender-specific hemodynamics in prefrontal cortex during a verbal working memory 
      task by near-infrared spectroscopy.
PG  - 148-53
LID - 10.1016/j.bbr.2010.01.033 [doi]
AB  - The presence or absence of gender differences in working memory, localized in the 
      prefrontal cortex (PFC), has been debated in a few fMRI studies. However, the 
      hypothesis of gender differences in PFC function has not been elaborated, and 
      comparisons among hemodynamic parameters designed to test for gender differences are 
      scarce. We utilized near-infrared spectroscopy during verbal N-back tasks on 26 male 
      and 24 female healthy volunteers. Changes in the concentrations of oxy- 
      (Delta[oxy-Hb]), deoxy- (Delta[deoxy-Hb]) and total hemoglobin (Delta[tot-Hb]) were 
      recorded simultaneously. Delta[oxy-Hb] and Delta[tot-Hb] exhibited obvious gender 
      differences, but Delta[deoxy-Hb] did not. Males showed bilateral activation with 
      slight left-side dominance, whereas females showed left activation. The activation 
      in males was more wide-spread and stronger than in females. Furthermore, females 
      required a lower hemodynamic supply than males to obtain comparable performance, and 
      only females exhibited positive correlations between hemodynamic parameters and 
      behavioral performance. The results reinforce the existence of a gender effect in 
      hemodynamic-based functional imaging studies. Our findings suggest that females 
      possess more efficient hemodynamics in the PFC during working memory and emphasize 
      the importance of studying the PFC to further a scientific understanding of gender 
      differences.

TI  - Working memory representation in atypical language dominance.
PG  - 2032-43
LID - 10.1002/hbm.20645 [doi]
AB  - One of the most important factors controlling material specific processing in the 
      human brain is language dominance, i.e. hemispheric specialization in semantic 
      processes. Although previous studies have shown that lateralized long-term memory 
      processes in the medial temporal lobes are modified in subjects with atypical 
      (right) language dominance, the effect of language dominance on the neural basis of 
      working memory (WM) has remained unknown. Here, we used functional MRI (fMRI) to 
      study the impact of language dominance on the neural representation of WM. We 
      conducted an n-back task in three different load conditions and with both verbal and 
      nonverbal (spatial) material in matched groups of left and right language dominant 
      subjects. This approach allowed us to investigate regions showing significant 
      interactions between language dominance and material. Overall, right dominant 
      subjects showed an increased inter-individual variability of WM-related activations. 
      Verbal WM involved more pronounced activation of the left fusiform cortex in left 
      dominant subjects and of the right inferior parietal lobule in the right dominant 
      group. Spatial WM, on the other hand, induced activation of right hemispheric 
      regions in left dominant subjects, but no specific activations in right dominant 
      subjects. Taken together, these findings indicate that the neural basis of verbal WM 
      processes depends on language dominance and is more mutable in right dominant 
      subjects. The increased variability in right dominant subjects strongly suggests 
      that a standard network of material-dependent WM processes exists in left dominant 
      subjects, and that right dominant subjects use variable alternative networks.

AB  - Working memory training has been widely used to investigate working memory 
      processes. We have shown previously that visual working memory benefits only from 
      intra-modal visual but not from across-modal auditory working memory training. In 
      the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study we examined whether auditory 
      working memory processes can also be trained specifically and which training-induced 
      activation changes accompany theses effects. It was investigated whether working 
      memory training with strongly distinct auditory materials transfers exclusively to 
      an auditory (intra-modal) working memory task or whether it generalizes to a 
      (across-modal) visual working memory task. We used adaptive n-back training with 
      tonal sequences and a passive control condition. The memory training led to a 
      reliable training gain. Transfer effects were found for the (intra-modal) auditory 
      but not for the (across-modal) visual transfer task. Training-induced activation 
      decreases in the auditory transfer task were found in two regions in the right 
      inferior frontal gyrus. These effects confirm our previous findings in the visual 
      modality and extents intra-modal effects in the prefrontal cortex to the auditory 
      modality. As the right inferior frontal gyrus is frequently found in maintaining 
      modality-specific auditory information, these results might reflect increased neural 
      efficiency in auditory working memory processes. Furthermore, task-unspecific 
      (amodal) activation decreases in the visual and auditory transfer task were found in 
      the right inferior parietal lobule and the superior portion of the right middle 
      frontal gyrus reflecting less demand on general attentional control processes. These 
      data are in good agreement with amodal activation decreases within the same brain 
      regions on a visual transfer task reported previously.

TI  - Gender differences in the cognitive control of emotion: An fMRI study.
PG  - 2744-54
AB  - The interaction of emotion and cognition has become a topic of major interest. 
      However, the influence of gender on the interplay between the two processes, along 
      with its neural correlates have not been fully analysed so far. In this functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study we induced negative emotion using negative 
      olfactory stimulation while male (n=21) and female (n=19) participants performed an 
      n-back verbal working memory task. Based on findings indicating increased emotional 
      reactivity in women, we expected the female participants to exhibit stronger 
      activation in characteristically emotion-associated areas during the interaction of 
      emotional and cognitive processing in comparison to the male participants. Both 
      groups were found to be significantly impaired in their working memory performance 
      by negative emotion induction. However, fMRI analysis revealed distinct differences 
      in neuronal activation between groups. In men, cognitive performance under negative 
      emotion induction was associated with extended activation patterns in mainly 
      prefrontal and superior parietal regions. In women, the interaction between emotion 
      and working memory yielded a significantly stronger response in the amygdala and the 
      orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) compared to their male counterparts. Our data suggest 
      that in women the interaction of verbal working memory and negative emotion is 
      associated with relative hyperactivation in more emotion-associated areas whereas in 
      men regions commonly regarded as important for cognition and cognitive control are 
      activated. These results provide new insights in gender-specific cerebral 
      mechanisms.

TI  - Acute psychological stress reduces working memory-related activity in the 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 25-32
LID - 10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.03.006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute psychological stress impairs higher-order cognitive function such 
      as working memory (WM). Similar impairments are seen in various psychiatric 
      disorders that are associated with higher susceptibility to stress and with 
      prefrontal cortical dysfunctions, suggesting that acute stress may play a potential 
      role in such dysfunctions. However, it remains unknown whether acute stress has 
      immediate effects on WM-related prefrontal activity. METHODS: Using functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated neural activity of 27 healthy 
      female participants during a blocked WM task (numerical N-back) while moderate 
      psychological stress was induced by viewing strongly aversive (vs. neutral) movie 
      material together with a self-referencing instruction. To assess stress 
      manipulation, autonomic and endocrine, as well as subjective, measurements were 
      acquired throughout the experiment. RESULTS: Successfully induced acute stress 
      resulted in significantly reduced WM-related activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal 
      cortex (DLPFC), and was accompanied by less deactivation in brain regions that are 
      jointly referred to as the default mode network. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      demonstrates that experimentally induced acute stress in healthy volunteers results 
      in a reduction of WM-related DLPFC activity and reallocation of neural resources 
      away from executive function networks. These effects may be explained by 
      supraoptimal levels of catecholamines potentially in conjunction with elevated 
      levels of cortisol. A similar mechanism involving acute stress as a mediating factor 
      may play an important role in higher-order cognitive deficits and hypofrontality 
      observed in various psychiatric disorders.

TI  - Combining HF rTMS over the Left DLPFC with Concurrent Cognitive Activity for the 
      Offline Modulation of Working Memory in Healthy Volunteers: A Proof-of-Concept 
      Study.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci10020083 [doi]
LID - 83
AB  - It has been proposed that the effectiveness of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) 
      as a cognitive enhancement technique may be enhanced by combining the stimulation 
      with concurrent cognitive activity. However, the benefits of such a combination in 
      comparison to protocols without ongoing cognitive activity have not yet been 
      studied. In the present study, we investigate the effects of fMRI-guided 
      high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF rTMS) over the left 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on working memory (WM) in healthy volunteers, 
      using an n-back task with spatial and verbal stimuli and a spatial span task. In two 
      combined protocols (TMS + WM + (maintenance) and TMS + WM + (rest)) trains of 
      stimuli were applied in the maintenance and rest periods of the modified Sternberg 
      task, respectively. We compared them to HF rTMS without a cognitive load (TMS + WM-) 
      and control stimulation (TMS - WM + (maintenance)). No serious adverse effects 
      appeared in this study. Among all protocols, significant effects on WM were shown 
      only for the TMS + WM- with oppositely directed influences of this protocol on 
      storage and manipulation in spatial WM. Moreover, there was a significant difference 
      between the effects of TMS + WM- and TMS + WM + (maintenance), suggesting that 
      simultaneous cognitive activity does not necessarily lead to an increase in TMS 
      effects.

TI  - Abnormal fMRI response of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in cognitively intact 
      siblings of patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 709-19
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The identification of neurobiological intermediate phenotypes may hasten 
      the search for susceptibility genes in complex psychiatric disorders such as 
      schizophrenia. Earlier family studies have suggested that deficits in executive 
      cognition and working memory may be related to genetic susceptibility for 
      schizophrenia, but the biological basis for this behavioral phenotype has not been 
      identified. METHOD: The authors used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
      during performance of the N-back working memory task to assess working 
      memory-related cortical physiology in nonschizophrenic, cognitively intact siblings 
      of patients with schizophrenia. They compared 23 unaffected siblings of 
      schizophrenic patients to 18 matched comparison subjects. As a planned replication, 
      they studied another 25 unaffected siblings and 15 comparison subjects. RESULTS: In 
      both cohorts, there were no group differences in working memory performance. 
      Nevertheless, both groups of siblings showed an exaggerated physiological response 
      in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that was qualitatively similar to 
      results of earlier fMRI studies of patients with schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      fMRI data provide direct evidence of a primary physiological abnormality in 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex function in individuals at greater genetic risk for 
      schizophrenia, even in the absence of a manifest cognitive abnormality. This 
      exaggerated fMRI response implicates inefficient processing of memory information at 
      the level of intrinsic prefrontal circuitry, similar to earlier findings in patients 
      with schizophrenia. These data predict that inheritance of alleles that contribute 
      to inefficient prefrontal information processing will increase risk for 
      schizophrenia.

PG  - 484-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate effects and functional mechanism of compound Congrongyizhi 
      Capsule (CCRC), a Chinese medicine, on cognitive functions against amnestic mild 
      cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients with functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) based on n-back task. METHODS: Forty-one aMCI participants from hospital and 
      local communities in Beijing and randomly divided into treatment (16 patients with 
      CCRC capsule treatment), placebo (12 patients with placebo capsules) and control 
      group (13 patients with no treatment). The duration of intervention lasted for 3 
      months. Neuropsychological tests and fMRI were applied to assess cognitive ability 
      and brain activation changes after three months treatment. RESULTS: Drug group 
      (n=16) presented increased significance in the MMSE (P=0.008) and digit span 
      (P<0.001) tests, while other scores of neuropsychological tests showed no 
      statistical significance. fMRI results showed an increased brain negative activation 
      in drug group during performing the n-back working-memory task in posterior 
      cingulate (PCC), inferior frontal gyrus and lingual gyrus regions after 3 months; 
      placebo and control group did not show the same effect. Meanwhile, there were 
      negative correlations between left PCC activation levels and changed values of MMSE 
      and digit span separately since increased negative activation was associated with 
      better performance on the scores of MMSE and Digit Span tests. CONCLUSIONS: CCRC can 
      increase negative activation degree of PCC under performing working memory tasks 
      while this modulation are associated with better performance on the MMSE and Digit 
      Span.

AB  - Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an optical neuroimaging method that 
      detects temporal concentration changes of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin 
      within the cortex, so that neural activation can be inferred. However, even though 
      fNIRS is a very practical and well-tolerated method with several advantages 
      particularly in methodically challenging measurement situations (e.g., during tasks 
      involving movement or open speech), it has been shown to be confounded by systemic 
      compounds of non-cerebral, extra-cranial origin (e.g. changes in blood pressure, 
      heart rate). Especially event-related signal patterns induced by dilation or 
      constriction of superficial forehead and temple veins impair the detection of 
      frontal brain activation elicited by cognitive tasks. To further investigate this 
      phenomenon, we conducted a simultaneous fNIRS-fMRI study applying a working memory 
      paradigm (n-back). Extra-cranial signals were obtained by extracting the BOLD signal 
      from fMRI voxels within the skin. To develop a filter method that corrects for 
      extra-cranial skin blood flow, particularly intended for fNIRS data sets recorded by 
      widely used continuous wave systems with fixed optode distances, we identified 
      channels over the forehead with probable major extra-cranial signal contributions. 
      The averaged signal from these channels was then subtracted from all fNIRS channels 
      of the probe set. Additionally, the data were corrected for motion and non-evoked 
      systemic artifacts. Applying these filters, we can show that measuring brain 
      activation in frontal brain areas with fNIRS was substantially improved. The 
      resulting signal resembled the fMRI parameters more closely than before the 
      correction. Future fNIRS studies measuring functional brain activation in the 
      forehead region need to consider the use of different filter options to correct for 
      interfering extra-cranial signals.

AB  - A growing interest in cerebellar function and its involvement in higher cognition 
      have prompted much research in recent years. Cerebellar presence in a wide range of 
      cognitive functions examined within an increasing body of neuroimaging literature 
      has been observed. We applied a meta-analytic approach, which employed the 
      activation likelihood estimate method, to consolidate results of cerebellar 
      involvement accumulated in different cognitive tasks of interest and systematically 
      identified similarities among the studies. The current analysis included 88 
      neuroimaging studies demonstrating cerebellar activations in higher cognitive 
      domains involving emotion, executive function, language, music, timing and working 
      memory. While largely consistent with a prior meta-analysis by Stoodley and 
      Schmahmann ([2009]: Neuroimage 44:489-501), our results extended their findings to 
      include music and timing domains to provide further insights into cerebellar 
      involvement and elucidate its role in higher cognition. In addition, we conducted 
      inter- and intradomain comparisons for the cognitive domains of emotion, language, 
      and working memory. We also considered task differences within the domain of verbal 
      working memory by conducting a comparison of the Sternberg with the n-back task, as 
      well as an analysis of the differential components within the Sternberg task. 
      Results showed a consistent cerebellar presence in the timing domain, providing 
      evidence for a role in time keeping. Unique clusters identified within the domain 
      further refine the topographic organization of the cerebellum.

AB  - Earlier studies have shown widespread alterations of functional connectivity of 
      various brain networks in schizophrenia, including the default mode network (DMN). 
      The DMN has also an important role in the performance of cognitive tasks. 
      Furthermore, treatment with second-generation antipsychotic drugs may ameliorate to 
      some degree working memory (WM) deficits and related brain activity. The aim of this 
      study was to evaluate the effects of treatment with olanzapine monotherapy on 
      functional connectivity among brain regions of the DMN during WM. Seventeen patients 
      underwent an 8-week prospective study and completed two functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) scans at 4 and 8 weeks of treatment during the performance 
      of the N-back WM task. To control for potential repetition effects, 19 healthy 
      controls also underwent two fMRI scans at a similar time interval. We used spatial 
      group-independent component analysis (ICA) to analyze fMRI data. Relative to 
      controls, patients with schizophrenia had reduced connectivity strength within the 
      DMN in posterior cingulate, whereas it was greater in precuneus and inferior 
      parietal lobule. Treatment with olanzapine was associated with increases in DMN 
      connectivity with ventromedial prefrontal cortex, but not in posterior regions of 
      DMN. These results suggest that treatment with olanzapine is associated with the 
      modulation of DMN connectivity in schizophrenia. In addition, our findings suggest 
      critical functional differences in the regions of DMN.

AB  - In recent years, several theories have been proposed in attempts to identify the 
      neural mechanisms underlying successful cognitive aging. Old subjects show increased 
      neural activity during the performance of tasks, mainly in prefrontal areas, which 
      is interpreted as a compensatory mechanism linked to functional brain efficiency. 
      Moreover, resting-state studies have concluded that elders show disconnection or 
      disruption of large-scale functional networks. We used functional MRI during 
      resting-state and a verbal n-back task with different levels of memory load in a 
      cohort of young and old healthy adults to identify patterns of networks associated 
      with working memory and brain default mode. We found that the disruption of 
      resting-state networks in the elderly coexists with task-related overactivations of 
      certain brain areas and with reorganizations within these functional networks. 
      Moreover, elders who were able to activate additional areas and to recruit a more 
      bilateral frontal pattern within the task-related network achieved successful 
      performance on the task. We concluded that the balanced and plastic reorganization 
      of brain networks underlies successful cognitive aging. This observation allows the 
      integration of several theories that have been proposed to date regarding the aging 
      brain.

TI  - Effects of task-irrelevant emotional stimuli on working memory processes in mild 
      cognitive impairment.
PG  - 439-53
LID - 10.3233/JAD-141848 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research suggests generally impaired cognitive control functions in 
      working memory (WM) processes in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 
      incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD). Little is known how emotional salience of 
      task-irrelevant stimuli may modulate cognitive control of WM performance and 
      neurofunctional activation in MCI and AD individuals. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the 
      impact of emotional task-irrelevant visual stimuli on cortical activation during 
      verbal WM. METHODS: Twelve AD/MCI individuals and 12 age-matched healthy individuals 
      performed a verbal WM (nback-) task with task-irrelevant emotionally neutral and 
      emotionally negative background pictures during fMRI measurement. RESULTS: AD/MCI 
      individuals showed decreased WM performance compared with controls; both AD/MCI and 
      control groups reacted slower during presentation of negative pictures, regardless 
      of WM difficulty. The AD/MCI group showed increased activation in the left 
      hemispheric prefrontal network, higher amygdala and less cerebellar activation with 
      increasing WM task difficulty compared to healthy controls. Correlation analysis 
      between neurofunctional activation and WM performance revealed a negative 
      correlation between task sensitivity and activation in the dorsal anterior cingulum 
      for the healthy controls but not for the AD/MCI group. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest 
      compensatory activation in prefrontal cortex and amygdala, but also dysfunctional 
      inhibition of distracting information in the AD/MCI group during higher WM task 
      difficulty. Additionally, attentional processes affecting the correlation between WM 
      performance and neurofunctional activation seem to be different between incipient AD 
      and healthy aging.

AB  - A comprehensive neuropsychological/psychiatric, MR imaging, (MRI), MR spectroscopy 
      (MRS), and functional MRI (fMRI) assessment was administered to children with fetal 
      alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) to determine if global and/or focal abnormalities 
      could be identified, and distinguish diagnostic subclassifications across the 
      spectrum. The four study groups included: 1. FAS/Partial FAS; 2. Static 
      Encephalopathy/Alcohol Exposed (SE/AE); 3. Neurobehavioral Disorder/Alcohol Exposed 
      (ND/AE); and 4. healthy peers with no prenatal alcohol exposure. fMRI outcomes are 
      reported here. The neuropsychological/psychiatric, MRI, and MRS outcomes are 
      reported separately. fMRI was used to assess activation in seven brain regions 
      during performance of N-back working memory tasks. Children across the full spectrum 
      of FASD exhibited significant working memory deficits and altered activation 
      patterns in brain regions that are known to be involved in working memory. These 
      results demonstrate the potential research and diagnostic value of this non-invasive 
      MR tool in the field of FASD.

TI  - Abnormal anterior cingulate cortical activity during emotional n-back task 
      performance distinguishes bipolar from unipolar depressed females.
PG  - 1417-28
LID - 10.1017/S003329171100242X [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression in the context of bipolar disorder (BDd) is often 
      misdiagnosed as unipolar disorder depression (UDd) leading to poor clinical outcomes 
      for many bipolar sufferers. We examined neural circuitry supporting emotion 
      regulation in females with either BDd or UDd as a first stage toward identifying 
      biomarkers that may differentiate BDd from UDd. METHOD: Fifty-seven females aged 
      18-45 years participated in this study: 23 with UDd, 18 with bipolar disorder type I 
      depression (BDId) and 16 healthy females. During 3-T functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI), the participants performed an emotional face n-back (EFNBACK) task, 
      that is an n-back task with high (2-back) and low (0-back) memory load conditions 
      flanked by two positive, negative or neutral face distracters. This paradigm 
      examines executive control with emotional distracters-emotion regulation. RESULTS: 
      High memory load with neutral face distracters elicited greater bilateral and left 
      dorsal anterior midcingulate cortex (dAMCC) activity in UDd than in healthy and BDId 
      females respectively, and greater bilateral putamen activity in both depressed 
      groups versus healthy females. High memory load with happy face distracters elicited 
      greater left putamen activity in UDd than in healthy females. Psychotropic 
      medication was associated with greater putamen activity to these contrasts in UDd 
      females. CONCLUSIONS: During high memory load with neutral face distracters, 
      elevated dAMCC activity in UDd suggests abnormal recruitment of attentional control 
      circuitry to maintain task performance, whereas elevated putamen activity unrelated 
      to psychotropic medication in BDId females may suggest an attentional bias toward 
      ambiguous neutral face distracters. Differential patterns of functional 
      abnormalities in neural circuitry supporting attentional control during emotion 
      regulation, especially in the dAMCC, is a promising neuroimaging measure to 
      distinguish UDd from BDId in females.

TI  - Evidence that altered amygdala activity in schizophrenia is related to clinical 
      state and not genetic risk.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although amygdala dysfunction is reported in schizophrenia, it is unknown 
      whether this deficit represents a heritable phenotype that is related to risk for 
      schizophrenia or whether it is related to disease state. The purpose of the present 
      study was to examine amygdala response to threatening faces among healthy siblings 
      of schizophrenia patients in whom a subtler heritable deficit might be observed. 
      METHOD: Participants were 34 schizophrenia patients, 29 unaffected siblings, and 20 
      healthy comparison subjects. Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) was conducted during an implicit facial information 
      processing task. The N-back working memory task, which has been shown to elicit 
      prefrontal cortex abnormalities in unaffected siblings of schizophrenia patients, 
      was employed as a positive experimental control. RESULTS: Schizophrenia patients 
      demonstrated a deficit in amygdala reactivity to negative face stimuli and an 
      alteration, correlated with neuroleptic drug dosage, in the functional coupling 
      between the amygdala and subgenual cingulate. In contrast, unaffected siblings 
      showed a pattern that was not statistically different from that of healthy 
      comparison subjects. During the N-back working memory task, both schizophrenia 
      patients and their unaffected siblings demonstrated a pattern of inefficient 
      prefrontal cortex engagement, which is consistent with earlier evidence that this 
      pattern is related to genetic risk for schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: These data 
      suggest that the pathophysiological mechanism underlying the inability of 
      individuals with schizophrenia to normally engage the amygdala in processing fearful 
      and angry facial representations is more likely a phenomenon related to the disease 
      state, specifically to treatment.

TI  - Inefficiently increased anterior cingulate modulation of cortical systems during 
      working memory in young offspring of schizophrenia patients.
PG  - 1067-76

AB  - BACKGROUND: Children and adolescent offspring of schizophrenia patients are at 
      increased risk for schizophrenia and are also characterized by impairments in brain 
      structure and function. To date, few studies have investigated whether functional 
      interactions between brain regions are intact or altered. Using an established 
      verbal working memory paradigm with variable levels of memory load, we investigated 
      the modulatory effect of activity in cognitive control regions of the brain 
      (specifically the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) on activity in core working 
      memory regions, in particular the dorsal prefrontal cortex and the parietal lobe. 
      METHODS: Forty four subjects participated. An n-back task with two levels of working 
      memory load (1- and 2-back) was employed during fMRI (4 T Bruker MedSpec system). 
      Data were processed with SPM5 and the modulatory effects of the anterior cingulate 
      were investigated using psycho-physiological interaction (PPI). RESULTS: In spite of 
      only subtle activation differences, and no significant differences in performance 
      accuracy, a significant group x memory load interaction in the parietal lobe, 
      indicated aberrantly increased modulatory inputs to this region under conditions of 
      high working memory load in schizophrenia offspring. DISCUSSION: Increased 
      modulatory inputs from a central control region like the anterior cingulate 
      presumably reflect relative inefficiency in intra-cortical interactions in the 
      vulnerable brain. This inefficiency may reflect a developmentally mediated 
      impairment in functional brain interactions in this important vulnerable population. 
      It is highly plausible that the resultant effect of these altered interactions is an 
      increased vulnerability to impaired brain development, and therefore to psychiatric 
      disorders including schizophrenia.

AB  - Within cognitive neuroscience, in nearly every experimental setting, subjects are 
      presented with stimuli that appear at either constant or variable points in time, 
      referred to as interstimulus intervals (ISIs). These temporal patterns differ in the 
      degree to which an exact stimulus onset may be predicted. We investigated whether 
      this experimental feature affects brain and behavior, and whether the impact is 
      modulated by the cognitive demands of a task. Subjects (N=26) were assessed via fMRI 
      while solving three different tasks under either temporally predictable (constant 
      ISI) or unpredictable (variable ISI) conditions. The tasks differed with regard to 
      demands on working memory and response uncertainty. Compared to constant ISIs, 
      variable (i.e., less predictable) ISIs led to a general increase in reaction time 
      and in right amygdala activation. Depending on the cognitive demands required by the 
      specific task, the left amygdala, the parietal cortex, the supplementary motor area, 
      and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were engaged as well. The results indicate 
      that the temporal structure in a stimulus sequence affects both overt and covert 
      behaviors. Implicit temporal uncertainty increases activation in several brain 
      regions depending on cognitive demands. Thus, an often-overlooked basic design 
      feature, the application of constant or variable ISIs, may contribute to 
      heterogeneity in cognitive neuroscience findings.

AB  - Demanding cognitive tasks are sometimes carried out under stressful conditions. 
      Several studies indicate that whereas severe stress impairs performance, moderate 
      stress can enhance cognitive performance. In this study, we investigated how 
      moderate stress influences the neural systems supporting working memory. We embedded 
      an N-back working memory task in a moderately stressful context, as indicated by our 
      physiological stress measures, and probed phasic and tonic human brain activity 
      using two fMRI-techniques: conventional blood oxygen level dependent fMRI and 
      arterial spin labeling (ASL). The results showed that the stress induction, as 
      compared to the neutral control condition, led to slightly faster reaction times 
      without changes in accuracy. In general, working memory processing was associated 
      with increased activity in a frontoparietal network and reduced activity in the 
      medial temporal lobe (MTL). The stress induction led to enhanced reduction of phasic 
      MTL responses, specifically the hippocampus and amygdala. In addition, ASL showed 
      that stress increased tonic amygdala activity, while tonic hippocampal activity was 
      unaffected. These findings suggest that the influence of stress on MTL deactivation 
      during working memory processing is task-related rather than a general consequence 
      of the stressful state. The temporal suspension of hippocampal processing in favor 
      of more task relevant processes may allow subjects to maintain normal performance 
      levels under moderate stress.

TI  - The neural system that bridges reward and cognition in humans: an fMRI study.
PG  - 5669-74
AB  - We test the hypothesis that motivational and cognitive processes are linked by a 
      specific neural system to reach maximal efficiency. We studied six normal subjects 
      performing a working memory paradigm (n-back tasks) associated with different levels 
      of monetary reward during an fMRI session. The study showed specific brain 
      activation in relation with changes in both the cognitive loading and the reward 
      associated with task performance. First, the working memory tasks activated a 
      network including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [Brodmann area (BA) 9/46] and, 
      in addition, in the lateral frontopolar areas (BA 10), but only in the more 
      demanding condition (3-back task). This result suggests that lateral prefrontal 
      areas are organized in a caudo-rostral continuum in relation with the increase in 
      executive requirement. Second, reward induces an increased activation in the areas 
      already activated by working memory processing and in a supplementary region, the 
      medial frontal pole (BA 10), regardless of the level of cognitive processing. It is 
      postulated that the latter region plays a specific role in monitoring the reward 
      value of ongoing cognitive processes. Third, we detected areas where the signal 
      decreases (ventral-BA 11/47 and subgenual prefrontal cortices) in relation with both 
      the increase of cognitive demand and the reward. The deactivation may represent an 
      emotional gating aimed at inhibiting adverse emotional signals to maximize the level 
      of performance. Taken together, these results suggest a balance between increasing 
      activity in cortical cognitive areas and decreasing activity in the limbic and 
      paralimbic structures during ongoing higher cognitive processing.

AB  - To investigate which neural correlates are associated with successful working memory 
      performance, fMRI was recorded in healthy younger and older adults during 
      performance on an n-back task with varying task demands. To identify functional 
      networks supporting working memory processes, we used independent component analysis 
      (ICA) decomposition of the fMRI data. Compared to younger adults, older adults 
      showed a larger neural (BOLD) response in the more complex (2-back) than in the 
      baseline (0-back) task condition, in the ventral lateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) 
      and in the right fronto-parietal network (FPN). Our results indicated that a higher 
      BOLD response in the VLPFC was associated with increased performance accuracy in 
      older adults, in the more complex task condition. This 'BOLD-performance' 
      relationship suggests that the neural correlates linked with successful performance 
      in the older adults are related to specific working memory processes present in the 
      complex but not in the baseline task condition [corrected].Furthermore, the 
      selective presence of this relationship in older but not in younger adults suggests 
      that increased neural activity in the VLPFC serves a compensatory role in the aging 
      brain which benefits task performance in the elderly.

AB  - In adults, cognitive control is supported by several brain regions including the 
      limbic system and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) when processing 
      emotional information. However, in adolescents, some theories hypothesize a 
      neurobiological imbalance proposing heightened sensitivity to affective material in 
      the amygdala and striatum within a cognitive control context. Yet, direct 
      neurobiological evidence is scarce. Twenty-four adolescents (12-16) and 28 adults 
      (25-35) completed an emotional n-back working memory task in response to happy, 
      angry, and neutral faces during fMRI. Importantly, participants either paid 
      attention to the emotion (task-relevant condition) or judged the gender 
      (task-irrelevant condition). Behaviorally, for both groups, when happy faces were 
      task-relevant, performance improved relative to when they were task-irrelevant, 
      while performance decrements were seen for angry faces. In the dlPFC, angry faces 
      elicited more activation in adults during low relative to high cognitive load 
      (2-back vs. 0-back). By contrast, happy faces elicited more activation in the 
      amygdala in adolescents when they were task-relevant. Happy faces also generally 
      increased nucleus accumbens activity (regardless of relevance) in adolescents 
      relative to adults. Together, the findings are consistent with neurobiological 
      models of adolescent brain development and identify neurodevelopmental differences 
      in cognitive control emotion interactions.

TI  - Failing to deactivate: the association between brain activity during a working 
      memory task and creativity.
PG  - 681-7
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.11.052 [doi]
AB  - Working memory (WM) is an essential component for human higher order cognitive 
      activities. Creativity has been essential to the development of human civilization. 
      Previous studies from different fields have suggested creativity and capacity of WM 
      have opposing characteristics possibly in terms of diffuse attention. However, 
      despite a number of functional imaging studies on creativity, how creativity relates 
      to brain activity during WM has never been investigated. In this functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we investigated this issue using an n-back WM 
      paradigm and a psychometric measure of creativity (a divergent thinking test). A 
      multiple regression analysis revealed that individual creativity was significantly 
      and positively correlated with brain activity in the precuneus during the 2-back 
      task (WM task), but not during the non-WM 0-back task. As the precuneus shows 
      deactivation during cognitive tasks, our findings show that reduced task induced 
      deactivation (TID) in the precuneus is associated with higher creativity measured by 
      divergent thinking. The precuneus is included in the default mode network, which is 
      deactivated during cognitive tasks. The magnitude of TID in the default mode network 
      is considered to reflect the reallocation of cognitive resources from networks 
      irrelevant to the performance of the task. Thus, our findings may indicate that 
      individual creativity, as measured by the divergent thinking test, is related to the 
      inefficient reallocation of attention, congruent with the idea that diffuse 
      attention is associated with individual creativity.

TI  - Brain activation during working memory after traumatic brain injury in children.
PG  - 16-24
AB  - Eight children with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and eight 
      matched, uninjured control children underwent fMRI during an N-back task to test 
      effects of TBI on working memory performance and brain activation. Two patterns in 
      the TBI group were observed. Patients whose criterion performance was reached at 
      lower memory loads than control children demonstrated less extensive frontal and 
      extrafrontal brain activation than controls. Patients who performed the same, 
      highest (3-back) memory load as controls demonstrated more frontal and extrafrontal 
      activation than controls. Our findings of performance and brain activation changes 
      in children after TBI await longitudinal investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are thought to play an 
      important role in cognitive function and nicotine dependence. The 
      catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor tolcapone, an FDA-approved treatment 
      for Parkinson's disease, increases prefrontal dopamine levels, with cognitive 
      benefits that may vary by COMT genotype. We tested whether tolcapone alters working 
      memory-related brain activity and performance in abstinent smokers. METHODS: In this 
      double-blind crossover study, 20 smokers completed 8 days of treatment with 
      tolcapone and placebo. In both medication periods, smokers completed blood oxygen 
      level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI scans while performing a working memory N-back task 
      after 24h of abstinence. Smokers were genotyped prospectively for the COMT 
      val(158)met polymorphism for exploratory analysis. RESULTS: Compared to placebo, 
      tolcapone modestly improved accuracy (p=0.017) and enhanced suppression of 
      activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) (p=0.002). There were no 
      effects of medication in other a priori regions of interest (dorsolateral PFC, 
      dorsal cingulate/medial prefrontal cortex, or posterior cingulate cortex). 
      Exploratory analyses suggested that tolcapone led to a decrease in BOLD signal in 
      several regions among smokers with val/val genotypes, but increased or remained 
      unchanged among met allele carriers. Tolcapone did not attenuate craving, mood, or 
      withdrawal symptoms compared to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this 
      proof-of-concept study do not provide strong support for further evaluation of COMT 
      inhibitors as smoking cessation aids.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Working memory (WM) deficits are among the most frequently impaired 
      cognitive domains in patients with Bipolar Disorder (BD), being considered promising 
      cognitive endophenotype of the disorder. However, the related neurobiological 
      correlates still deserve further investigation. The present study was aimed to 
      explore whether dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity during WM processing 
      was abnormal in euthymic bipolar patients and may represent a potential 
      trait-related phenotype associated with the disorder. METHODS: Using 3 Tesla 
      functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (3T fMRI), we studied 28 euthymic bipolar 
      patients (15 BDI and 13 BDII), and 27 healthy controls (HCs), matched for a series 
      of socio-demographic variables, while performing the N-back task for WM assessment. 
      RESULTS: We found that euthymic bipolar patients showed increased right middle 
      frontal gyrus engagement compared with HCs (FWE-corrected p = 1 × 10(-3)), 
      regardless of WM load, and in spite of similar WM behavioral performance between 
      groups. In particular, BDI patients had greater BOLD signal change compared to HCs 
      (post-hoc Tukey HSD, p = 1 × 10(-3)), while BDII patients expressed an intermediate 
      pattern of activation between BDI patients and HCs. No other significant effects 
      were detected in the corrected whole-brain analysis. LIMITATIONS: Sample size, 
      cross-sectional assessment and potential influence of some clinical variables. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Results provide direct evidence of a primary physiological abnormality 
      in DLPFC function in BDI and II, even in the absence of behavioral differences with 
      HCs. Such exaggerated fMRI response suggests inefficient WM processing in prefrontal 
      circuitry, and further studies are warranted to investigate whether the dysfunction 
      is related to the genetic risk for the disorder.

TI  - An investigation into aripiprazole's partial D₂ agonist effects within the 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during working memory in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 1415-26

AB  - RATIONALE: Working memory impairments in schizophrenia have been attributed to 
      dysfunction of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) which in turn may be due 
      to low DLPFC dopamine innervation. Conventional antipsychotic drugs block DLPFC D2 
      receptors, and this may lead to further dysfunction and working memory impairments. 
      Aripiprazole is a D2 receptor partial agonist hypothesised to enhance PFC dopamine 
      functioning, possibly improving working memory. OBJECTIVES: We probed the 
      implications of the partial D2 receptor agonist actions of aripiprazole within the 
      DLPFC during working memory. Investigations were carried out in healthy volunteers 
      to eliminate confounds of illness or medication status. Aripiprazole's prefrontal 
      actions were compared with the D2/5-HT2A blocker risperidone to separate 
      aripiprazole's unique prefrontal D2 agonist actions from its serotinergic and 
      striatal D2 actions that it shares with risperidone. METHOD: A double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled, parallel design was implemented. Participants received a single 
      dose of either 5 mg aripiprazole, 1 mg risperidone or placebo before performing the 
      n-back task whilst undergoing fMRI scanning. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, the 
      aripiprazole group demonstrated enhanced DLPFC activation associated with a trend 
      for improved discriminability (d') and speeded reaction times. In contrast to 
      aripiprazole's neural effects, the risperidone group demonstrated a trend for 
      reduced DLPFC recruitment. Unexpectedly, the risperidone group demonstrated similar 
      effects to aripiprazole on d' and additionally had reduced errors of commission 
      compared with placebo. CONCLUSION: Aripiprazole has unique DLPFC actions attributed 
      to its prefrontal D2 agonist action. Risperidone's serotinergic action that results 
      in prefrontal dopamine release may have protected against any impairing effects of 
      its prefrontal D2 blockade.

TI  - Functional dissociations within the inferior parietal cortex in verbal working 
      memory.
PG  - 562-73
AB  - Neuroimaging studies of working memory have revealed two sites in the left 
      supramarginal gyrus that may support the short-term storage of phonological 
      information. Activation in the left dorsal aspect of the inferior parietal cortex 
      (DIPC) has been observed in contrasts of working memory load, whereas activation in 
      the ventral aspect of the inferior parietal cortex (VIPC) has been found primarily 
      in contrast of information type (verbal vs. nonverbal). Our goal was to determine 
      whether these two areas are functionally distinct or if instead they are part of a 
      homogeneous region with large variations in the focus of peak activity. Toward this 
      end, we used fMRI to assess the neural response in two working memory tasks (N-back 
      and item recognition) in which we also manipulated memory load and the type of 
      information to be recalled (verbal vs. nonverbal). We found both DIPC and VIPC 
      activation in the same group of subjects and further demonstrated that they have 
      differential sensitivity to our experimental factors. Only the DIPC showed robust 
      load effects, whereas only the VIPC showed reliable effects of information type. 
      These results help to account for the differences observed in between-subject 
      comparisons, and they indicate that the two regions are functionally dissociable. In 
      contrast to the DIPC, activity of the VIPC was also recruited in the fixation and 
      low-load conditions, a surprising result that has not been fully explored in prior 
      studies. Despite their distinctive patterns of performance, neither of these regions 
      displayed a pattern of activity that entirely corresponds to common assumptions of a 
      dedicated phonological short-term store (STS). Instead, we hypothesize that the DIPC 
      may support domain-general executive processes, while the VIPC may support 
      phonological encoding-recoding processes central to a variety of language tasks.

TI  - Independent component model of the default-mode brain function: Assessing the impact 
      of active thinking.
PG  - 263-9
AB  - The "default-mode" network is an ensemble of cortical regions, which are typically 
      deactivated during demanding cognitive tasks in functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) studies. Using functional connectivity, this network can be 
      conceptualized and studied as a "stand-alone" function or system. Regardless of the 
      task, independent component analysis (ICA) produces a picture of the "default-mode" 
      function even when the subject is performing a simple sensori-motor task or just 
      resting in the scanner. This has boosted the use of default-mode fMRI for 
      non-invasive research in brain disorders. Here, we studied the effect of cognitive 
      load modulation of fMRI responses on the ICA-based pictures of the default-mode 
      function. In a standard graded working memory study based on the n-back task, we 
      used group-level ICA to explore the variability of the default-mode network related 
      to the engagement in the task, in 10 healthy volunteers. The analysis of the 
      default-mode components highlighted similarities and differences in the layout under 
      three different cognitive loads. We found a load-related general increase of 
      deactivation in the cortical network. Nonetheless, a variable recruitment of the 
      cingulate regions was evident, with greater extension of the anterior and lesser 
      extension of the posterior clusters when switching from lower to higher working 
      memory loads. A co-activation of the hippocampus was only found under no working 
      memory load. As a generalization of our results, the variability of the default-mode 
      pattern may link the default-mode system as a whole to cognition and may more 
      directly support use of the ICA model for evaluating cognitive decline in brain 
      disorders.

AB  - While behavioural trials of working memory (WM) training have received much 
      attention in recent years, a lesser explored parallel approach is functional 
      neuroimaging. A small literature has suggested a complex time course for functional 
      activation pattern changes following WM training (i.e. not simply increasing or 
      decreasing due to training); however, no study to date has examined such 
      neuroplastic effects in both the training task (dual n-back) and the fluid 
      intelligence transfer task to which the training is purported to transfer (Raven's 
      Matrices). This study investigated neural correlates of WM training in healthy young 
      adults randomized to six weeks of WM training, or an active control condition 
      (processing speed training) with a pre- and post-training fMRI design. Results 
      indicated significant reductions in activation for the WM trained group in key 
      WM-task related areas for trained WM tasks after training compared to the processing 
      speed active control group. The same pattern of training related decreases in 
      activation for the WM trained group was not observed for the transfer task, which is 
      consistent with null results for all cognitive outcomes of the present trial. The 
      observed pattern of results suggests that repetitive practice with a complex task 
      does indeed lead to neuroplastic processes that very likely represent the reduced 
      demand for attentional control while sub-components of the task become more 
      routinized with practice. We suggest that future research investigate neural 
      correlates of WM training in populations for which WM itself is impaired and/or 
      behavioural trials of WM training have returned more promising results.

TI  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging response to increased verbal working memory 
      demands among patients with multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 28-36
AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients frequently experience impaired verbal working 
      memory (VWM). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may help identify neural 
      mechanisms underlying these deficits. Neuroimaging studies of healthy adults have 
      characterized responses associated with increased VWM demands during the n-Back 
      task, suggesting that this experimental paradigm could help identify neural 
      correlates of VWM deficits among MS patients. Fifteen MS patients and 15 matched 
      control participants completed the n-Back during whole-brain fMRI. Mean signal 
      during adjacent 0-Back blocks was subtracted, on a voxel-wise basis, from mean 
      signal observed during n-Back blocks. Resulting difference scores for 1-, 2-, and 
      3-Back were compared across groups and difficulty levels. Signal intensity was 
      positively related to difficulty level in anterior regions, including premotor, 
      supplementary motor, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. MS patients exhibited 
      significantly greater intensity in these areas compared to controls during the 
      1-Back, while portions of the left superior frontal gyrus, cingulate, and 
      parahippocampal gyri were relatively less intense at more difficult levels. MS group 
      responses were slower during the 1-Back and tended to be slower during the 3-Back; 
      however, accuracy did not differ at any level. Lesion load was positively related to 
      only 1-Back activity and unrelated to any performance measure. Results suggest that 
      compensatory activity occurs among MS patients matched on performance accuracy. 
      Furthermore, compensatory activity occurs predominantly in regions associated with 
      VWM, and this may decline relative to controls as task demands increase. These 
      findings may help to explain why MS patient performance decreases as a function of 
      effort on neuropsychological tests.

      and neural correlates.
PG  - 724-41
AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is often associated with enduring impairments in 
      high-level cognitive functioning, including working memory (WM). We examined WM 
      function in predominantly chronic patients with mild, moderate and severe TBI and 
      healthy comparison subjects behaviorally and, in a small subset of 
      moderate-to-severe TBI patients, with event-related functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI), using a visual n-back task that parametrically varied WM load. TBI 
      patients showed severity-dependent and load-related WM deficits in performance 
      accuracy, but not reaction time. Performance of mild TBI patients did not differ 
      from controls; patients with moderate and severe TBI were impaired, relative to 
      controls and mild TBI patients, but only at higher WM-load levels. fMRI results show 
      that TBI patients exhibit altered patterns of activation in a number of WM-related 
      brain regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and Broca's area. 
      Examination of the pattern of behavioral responding and the temporal course of 
      activations suggests that WM deficits in moderate-to-severe TBI are due to 
      associative or strategic aspects of WM, and not impairments in active maintenance of 
      stimulus representations. Overall, results demonstrate that individuals with 
      moderate-to-severe TBI exhibit WM deficits that are associated with dysfunction 
      within a distributed network of brain regions that support verbally mediated WM.

AB  - Functional neuroimaging studies carried out on healthy volunteers while performing 
      different n-back tasks have shown a common pattern of bilateral frontoparietal 
      activation, especially of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Our objective 
      was to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare the pattern of 
      brain activation while performing two similar n-back tasks which differed in their 
      presentation modality. Thirteen healthy volunteers completed a verbal 2-back task 
      presenting auditory stimuli, and a similar 2-back task presenting visual stimuli. A 
      conjunction analysis showed bilateral activation of frontoparietal areas including 
      the DLPFC. The left DLPFC and the superior temporal gyrus showed a greater 
      activation in the auditory than in the visual condition, whereas posterior brain 
      regions and the anterior cingulate showed a greater activation during the visual 
      than during the auditory task. Thus, brain areas involved in the visual and auditory 
      versions of the n-back task showed an important overlap between them, reflecting the 
      supramodal characteristics of working memory. However, the differences found between 
      the two modalities should be considered in order to select the most appropriate task 
      for future clinical studies.

      genetic imaging study.
PG  - 111-7
LID - 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2007.12.002 [doi]
AB  - Imaging studies have demonstrated that prefrontal and parietal regions are activated 
      during working memory (WM) tasks. Recently some molecular genetic studies reported 
      associations between a functional promoter polymorphism of the tryptophan 
      hydroxylase 2 gene (TPH2), that regulates the synthesis of serotonin, and attention. 
      In 49 healthy Caucasian subjects the role of the TPH2 -703 G/T polymorphism for WM 
      was tested by means of an imaging genomics approach in an n-back task. fMRI data 
      showed an increased activation for the 2-back as compared to the 0-back condition 
      for a large network in prefrontal and parietal areas. Although behavioural data 
      showed no performance differences between the genotype groups of the -703 G/T a 
      significantly stronger activation of the TT genotype carriers in BA 6, BA 46, and BA 
      40 was visible in contrast to the GT and GG groups. Present findings in congruence 
      with previous findings support the hypothesis that TT carriers compensate deficits 
      in executive control functions by increased brain activity.

LID - 10.1002/hbm.21138 [doi]
AB  - Interregional correlations between blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) signals in the resting state have been interpreted as 
      measures of connectivity across the brain. Here we investigate whether such 
      connectivity in the working memory and default mode networks is modulated by changes 
      in cognitive load. Functional connectivity was measured in a steady-state verbal 
      identity N-back task for three different conditions (N = 1, 2, and 3) as well as in 
      the resting state. We found that as cognitive load increases, the functional 
      connectivity within both the working memory the default mode network increases. To 
      test whether functional connectivity between the working memory and the default mode 
      networks changed, we constructed maps of functional connectivity to the working 
      memory network as a whole and found that increasingly negative correlations emerged 
      in a dorsal region of the posterior cingulate cortex. These results provide further 
      evidence that low frequency fluctuations in BOLD signals reflect variations in 
      neural activity and suggests interaction between the default mode network and other 
      cognitive networks.

      cognition: an fMRI study.
PG  - 753-61
LID - 10.1002/hbm.21470 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) is an X-linked urea cycle 
      disorder characterized by hyperammonemia resulting in white matter injury and 
      impairments in working memory and executive cognition. OBJECTIVE: To test for 
      differences in BOLD signal activation between subjects with OTCD and healthy 
      controls during a working memory task. DESIGN, SETTING AND PATIENTS: Nineteen 
      subjects with OTCD and 21 healthy controls participated in a case-control, 
      IRB-approved study at Georgetown University Medical Center. INTERVENTION: An N-back 
      working memory task was performed in a block design using 3T functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging. RESULTS: In subjects with OTCD we observed increased BOLD signal 
      in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex 
      (ACC) relative to healthy age matched controls. CONCLUSIONS: Increased neuronal 
      activation in OTCD subjects despite equivalent task performance points to 
      sub-optimal activation of the working memory network in these subjects, most likely 
      reflecting damage caused by hyperammonemic events. These increases directly relate 
      to our previous finding of reduced frontal white matter integrity in the superior 
      extents of the corpus callosum; key hemispheric connections for these areas. Future 
      studies using higher cognitive load are required to further characterize these 
      effects.

TI  - Activity in fusiform face area modulated as a function of working memory load.
PG  - 355-64
AB  - Previous fMRI results suggest that extrastriate visual areas have a predominant role 
      in perceptual processing while the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has a predominant role in 
      working memory. In contrast, single-unit recording studies in monkeys have 
      demonstrated a relationship between extrastriate visual areas and visual working 
      memory tasks. In this study we tested whether activity in both the PFC and fusiform 
      face area (FFA) changed with increasing demands of an n-back task for gray-scale 
      faces. Since stimulus presentation was identical across conditions, the n-back task 
      allowed us to parametrically vary working memory demands across conditions while 
      holding perceptual and motor demands constant. This study replicated the result of 
      PFC areas of activation that increased directly with load n of the task. The novel 
      finding in all subjects was FFA activation that also increased directly with load n 
      of the task. Since perceptual demands were equivalent across the three task 
      conditions, these findings suggest that activity in both the PFC and the FFA vary 
      with face working memory demands.

TI  - When less is more: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study of verbal working 
      memory in remitted depressed patients.
PG  - 1197-203
LID - 10.1017/S0033291713001682 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with depression show abnormalities in the neural circuitry 
      supporting working memory. However, it is unclear if these abnormalities are present 
      in unmedicated remitted depressed patients. To address this question, the current 
      study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in combination with a 
      simple verbal n-back task, in a cohort of unmedicated remitted depressed patients. 
      METHOD: We studied 15 healthy control subjects (HC) and 15 unmedicated remitted 
      depressed patients (rMDD). Participants performed a verbal working memory task of 
      varying cognitive load (n-back) while undergoing fMRI. We used multiple regression 
      analyses to assess overall capacity (1-, 2-, 3-back versus 0-back) as well as 
      quadratic modulation of cognitive demand. RESULTS: Performance accuracy and response 
      latency did not differ between groups, and overall capacity was similar. However, 
      rMDD showed a positive quadratic load response in the bilateral hippocampus; the 
      converse was true for HC. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that remitted depression was 
      associated with a perturbed pattern of activation in the bilateral hippocampus 
      during a verbal working memory task. We propose that a reduced ability to dampen 
      task-irrelevant activity may reflect a neurobiological risk factor for recurrent 
      depression.

TI  - Increased cortical activity in binge drinkers during working memory task: a 
      preliminary assessment through a functional magnetic resonance imaging study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebral dysfunction is a common feature of both chronic alcohol abusers 
      and binge drinkers. Here, we aimed to study whether, at equated behavioral 
      performance levels, binge drinkers exhibited increased neural activity while 
      performing simple cognitive tasks. METHODS: Thirty-two participants (16 binge 
      drinkers and 16 matched controls) were scanned using functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) while performing an n-back working memory task. In the control 
      zero-back (N0) condition, subjects were required to press a button with the right 
      hand when the number "2" was displayed. In the two-back (N2) condition, subjects had 
      to press a button when the displayed number was identical to the number shown two 
      trials before. RESULTS: fMRI analyses revealed higher bilateral activity in the 
      pre-supplementary motor area in binge drinkers than matched controls, even though 
      behavioral performances were similar. Moreover, binge drinkers showed specific 
      positive correlations between the number of alcohol doses consumed per occasion and 
      higher activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, as well as between the number 
      of drinking occasions per week and higher activity in cerebellum, thalamus and 
      insula while performing the N2 memory task. CONCLUSIONS: Binge alcohol consumption 
      leads to possible compensatory cerebral changes in binge drinkers that facilitate 
      normal behavioral performance. These changes in cerebral responses may be considered 
      as vulnerability factors for developing adult substance use disorders.

TI  - An fMRI study of executive functioning after severe diffuse TBI.
PG  - 919-30
AB  - PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Preliminary study of whether severe diffuse traumatic brain 
      injury (TBI) increases extent of frontal tissue recruited by cognitive control 
      tasks. RESEARCH DESIGN: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on N-back 
      working memory (WM)and arrows inhibition tasks in a 46 year old man who had severe 
      diffuse TBI 1 year earlier, a 44 year old man (inhibition task) and three women 
      (working memory task), age 20-26 years. Images were acquired by 1.5 T magnet with 
      BOLD method and PRESTO pulse sequence and analysed using SPM. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      RESULTS: Frontal activation increased under 2-back relative to 1-back condition of 
      working memory in all participants with more extensive activation in the TBI patient 
      relative to controls. Frontal activation increased with inhibition on the arrows 
      task, but was greater in the TBI patient. CONCLUSION: Severe diffuse TBI results in 
      recruitment of additional neural resources for cognitive control.

TI  - Direct comparison of prefrontal cortex regions engaged by working and long-term 
      memory tasks.
PG  - 48-59
AB  - Neuroimaging studies have suggested the involvement of ventrolateral, dorsolateral, 
      and frontopolar prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions in both working (WM) and long-term 
      memory (LTM). The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to 
      directly compare whether these PFC regions show selective activation associated with 
      one memory domain. In a within-subjects design, subjects performed the n-back WM 
      task (two-back condition) as well as LTM encoding (intentional memorization) and 
      retrieval (yes-no recognition) tasks. Additionally, each task was performed with two 
      different types of stimulus materials (familiar words, unfamiliar faces) in order to 
      determine the influence of material-type vs task-type. A bilateral region of 
      dorsolateral PFC (DL-PFC; BA 46/9) was found to be selectively activated during the 
      two-back condition, consistent with a hypothesized role for this region in active 
      maintenance and/or manipulation of information in WM. Left frontopolar PFC (FP-PFC) 
      was also found to be selectively engaged during the two-back. Although FP-PFC 
      activity has been previously associated with retrieval from LTM, no frontopolar 
      regions were found to be selectively engaged by retrieval. Finally, lateralized 
      ventrolateral PFC (VL-PFC) regions were found to be selectively engaged by 
      material-type, but uninfluenced by task-type. These results highlight the importance 
      of examining PFC activity across multiple memory domains, both for functionally 
      differentiating PFC regions (e.g., task-selectivity vs material-selectivity in 
      DL-PFC and VL-PFC) and for testing the applicability of memory domain-specific 
      theories (e.g., FP-PFC in LTM retrieval).

TI  - Treatment with a nicotine vaccine does not lead to changes in brain activity during 
      smoking cue exposure or a working memory task.
PG  - 1260-7

AB  - AIMS: To assess whether immunization attenuates nicotinic stimulation of the brain 
      and elucidate brain and behavioural responses during exposure to smoking cues and a 
      working memory task. DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled parallel-group, 
      repeated-measures design. SETTING: Maastricht University, the Netherlands. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Forty-eight male smokers were randomized to receive five injections 
      with either 400 μg/ml of the 3'-aminomethylnicotine Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
      r-Exoprotein-conjugated vaccine or placebo. Subjects were tested on two occasions, 
      once after a nicotine challenge and once after a placebo challenge, and were asked 
      to refrain from smoking 10 hours before testing. MEASUREMENTS: Reaction-times and 
      accuracies were recorded during an n-back task. Moreover, regional blood oxygenated 
      level-dependent (BOLD) response was measured during this task and during smoking cue 
      exposure. FINDINGS: Greater activation was found in response to smoking cues 
      compared to neutral cues in bilateral trans-occipital sulcus (P < 0.005); however, 
      this effect did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. There was no 
      difference in brain activity to smoking cues between the treatment groups and no 
      effects of acute nicotine challenge were established. For the n-back task we found 
      working memory load-sensitive increases in brain activity in several frontal and 
      parietal areas (P < 0.0025). However, no effects of immunization or nicotine 
      challenge were observed. CONCLUSION: No significant effects of immunization on brain 
      activity in response to a nicotine challenge were established. Therefore this 
      vaccine is not likely to be an effective aid in smoking cessation.

TI  - Being right is its own reward: load and performance related ventral striatum 
      activation to correct responses during a working memory task in youth.

AB  - The ventral striatum (VS) is a critical brain region for reinforcement learning and 
      motivation. Intrinsically motivated subjects performing challenging cognitive tasks 
      engage reinforcement circuitry including VS even in the absence of external feedback 
      or incentives. However, little is known about how such VS responses develop with 
      age, relate to task performance, and are influenced by task difficulty. Here we used 
      fMRI to examine VS activation to correct and incorrect responses during a standard 
      n-back working memory task in a large sample (n=304) of healthy children, 
      adolescents and young adults aged 8-22. We found that bilateral VS activates more 
      strongly to correct than incorrect responses, and that the VS response scales with 
      the difficulty of the working memory task. Furthermore, VS response was correlated 
      with discrimination performance during the task, and the magnitude of VS response 
      peaked in mid-adolescence. These findings provide evidence for scalable intrinsic 
      reinforcement signals during standard cognitive tasks, and suggest a novel link 
      between motivation and cognition during adolescent development.

AB  - Older adults tend to over-activate regions throughout frontoparietal cortices and 
      exhibit a reduced range of functional modulation during WM task performance compared 
      to younger adults. While recent evidence suggests that reduced functional modulation 
      is associated with poorer task performance, it remains unclear whether reduced range 
      of modulation is indicative of general WM capacity-limitations. In the current 
      study, we examined whether the range of functional modulation observed over multiple 
      levels of WM task difficulty (N-Back) predicts in-scanner task performance and 
      out-of-scanner psychometric estimates of WM capacity. Within our sample (60-77years 
      of age), age was negatively associated with frontoparietal modulation range. 
      Individuals with greater modulation range exhibited more accurate N-Back 
      performance. In addition, despite a lack of significant relationships between N-Back 
      and complex span task performance, range of frontoparietal modulation during the 
      N-Back significantly predicted domain-general estimates of WM capacity. Consistent 
      with previous cross-sectional findings, older individuals with less modulation range 
      exhibited greater activation at the lowest level of task difficulty but less 
      activation at the highest levels of task difficulty. Our results are largely 
      consistent with existing theories of neurocognitive aging (e.g. CRUNCH) but focus 
      attention on dynamic range of functional modulation asa novel marker of WM 
      capacity-limitations in older adults.

TI  - Neural substrates associated with the concurrent performance of dual working memory 
      tasks.
PG  - 613-31
AB  - The neural substrates of the dual working memory (WM) process were investigated 
      using concurrent performance of auditory and visual n-back WM tasks. Based on the 
      pre-fMRI behavioral testing, a lettered 1-back WM paradigm was implemented for an 
      fMRI examination of healthy volunteers who performed (1) auditory, (2) visual, and 
      (3) simultaneous visual and auditory WM tasks. The behavioral performance, as 
      measured by the reaction time, was deteriorated in the dual task condition compared 
      to the single task condition. Group analysis of the fMRI data revealed that the 
      majority of activation identified during each component task was concurrently 
      activated in the dual task condition. However, several neural substrates such as 
      left middle frontal gyrus, left superior parietal lobule, posterior aspect of right 
      inferior temporal gyrus, and bilateral parahippocampal gyri were selectively 
      activated during the dual WM task. These data suggest that new neural networks come 
      into play to assist in the greater load placed on the WM with the incongruent 
      stimulation modality, which may also have implications in crossmodal integrative 
      processes.

PG  - e6626
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0006626 [doi]
LID - e6626
AB  - BACKGROUND: In functional magnetic resonance imaging, the brain's response to 
      experimental manipulation is almost always assumed to be independent of endogenous 
      oscillations. To test this, we addressed the possible interaction between cognitive 
      task performance and endogenous fMRI oscillations in an experiment designed to 
      answer two questions: 1) Does performance of a cognitively effortful task 
      significantly change fractal scaling properties of fMRI time series compared to 
      their values before task performance? 2) If so, can we relate the extent of 
      task-related perturbation to the difficulty of the task? METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL 
      FINDINGS: Using a novel continuous acquisition "rest-task-rest" design, we found 
      that endogenous dynamics tended to recover their pre-task parameter values 
      relatively slowly, over the course of several minutes, following completion of one 
      of two versions of the n-back working memory task and that the rate of recovery was 
      slower following completion of the more demanding (n = 2) version of the task. 
      CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This result supports the model that endogenous low 
      frequency oscillatory dynamics are relevant to the brain's response to exogenous 
      stimulation. Moreover, it suggests that large-scale neurocognitive systems measured 
      using fMRI, like the heart and other physiological systems subjected to external 
      demands for enhanced performance, can take a considerable period of time to return 
      to a stable baseline state.

TI  - Exposure to Blue Light Increases Subsequent Functional Activation of the Prefrontal 
      Cortex During Performance of a Working Memory Task.
PG  - 1671-80
LID - 10.5665/sleep.6090 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Prolonged exposure to blue wavelength light has been shown to have 
      an alerting effect, and enhances performance on cognitive tasks. A small number of 
      studies have also shown that relatively short exposure to blue light leads to 
      changes in functional brain responses during the period of exposure. The extent to 
      which blue light continues to affect brain functioning during a cognitively 
      challenging task after cessation of longer periods of exposure (i.e., roughly 30 
      minutes or longer), however, has not been fully investigated. METHODS: A total of 35 
      healthy participants (18 female) were exposed to either blue (469 nm) (n = 17) or 
      amber (578 nm) (n = 18) wavelength light for 30 minutes in a darkened room, followed 
      immediately by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while undergoing a 
      working memory task (N-back task). RESULTS: Participants in the blue light condition 
      were faster in their responses on the N-back task and showed increased activation in 
      the dorsolateral (DLPFC) and ventrolateral (VLPFC) prefrontal cortex compared to 
      those in the amber control light condition. Furthermore, greater activation within 
      the VLPFC was correlated with faster N-back response times. CONCLUSIONS: This is the 
      first study to suggest that a relatively brief, single exposure to blue light has a 
      subsequent beneficial effect on working memory performance, even after cessation of 
      exposure, and leads to temporarily persisting functional brain changes within 
      prefrontal brain regions associated with executive functions. These findings may 
      have broader implication for using blue-enriched light in a variety of work settings 
      where alertness and quick decision-making are important.

TI  - Limbic over-activity in depression during preserved performance on the n-back task.
PG  - 203-15
AB  - The profile of cognitive dysfunction observed in patients with major depressive 
      disorder (MDD) may be partially attributed to a deficit in the central executive 
      component of working memory (WM). This could be the consequence of a functional 
      deficit in regions of cortex that are associated with WM function in healthy adults. 
      In order to investigate this assertion, ten patients with a diagnosis of MDD and ten 
      matched healthy controls undertook a parametric WM task (i.e. the n-back task) 
      during the acquisition of blood oxygen level dependent echo planar magnetic 
      resonance images (BOLD EPI fMRI). There was no significant difference in the 
      behavioral performance of depressed patients and controls. This was true for both 
      accuracy and reaction time on the n-back task. Random effects analysis of the 
      functional imaging data (using SPM99) revealed a significant difference in 
      load-dependent activation in the medial orbitofrontal cortex/rostral anterior 
      cingulate between patients and controls (cluster size (K(E))/volume = 128/1024 mm3, 
      P(corrected) = 0.025). While both participant groups exhibited a significant 
      decrease in activation in this region with increased task difficulty, the magnitude 
      of this decrease was smaller in patients with MDD than in controls. Therefore, this 
      study implies that the performance of WM tasks is associated with a dysfunctional 
      activation of the medial orbitofrontal and rostral anterior cingulate cortex in MDD. 
      The study thus offers a rationale for explaining depressive cognitive impairment by 
      the abnormal fronto-limbic activation found in clinical depression.

AB  - We report the effects of a 4-week trial of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      (DTMS) on depressive and anxious symptoms and brain activity in a patient (Mrs A) 
      with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The protocol involved a pre- and a 
      post-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan during which Mrs A had to 
      perform a working memory task (i.e., n-back). Her baseline score on the 21-item 
      Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D21) was 24, indicating severe depressive 
      symptoms. Immediately after 4 weeks of daily DTMS treatment applied over the left 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), her HAM-D21 score decreased to 13 (a 46% 
      reduction), and 1 month later, it was 12 (a 50% reduction). Moreover, Mrs A's 
      accuracy scores on the n-back task (i.e., 2-back condition) improved from 79% 
      (baseline) to 96% (after DTMS treatment). At the neural level, Mrs A showed 
      significantly increased brain activity in the working memory network (e.g., DLPFC, 
      parietal cortex) during the execution of the 2-back condition after DTMS treatment 
      compared to baseline.

TI  - The effects of the COMT Val108/158Met polymorphism on BOLD activation during working 
      memory, planning, and response inhibition: a role for the posterior cingulate 
      cortex?
PG  - 763-71
LID - 10.1038/npp.2010.210 [doi]
AB  - Catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) val(108/158)met polymorphism impacts on 
      cortical dopamine levels and may influence functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) 
      measures of task-related neuronal activity. Here, we investigate whether COMT 
      genotype influences cortical activations, particularly prefrontal activations, by 
      interrogating its effect across three tasks that have been associated with the 
      dopaminergic system in a large cohort of healthy volunteers. A total of 50 
      participants (13 met/met, 23 val/met, and 14 val/val) successfully completed N-Back, 
      Go-NoGo, and Tower of London fMRI tasks. Image analysis was performed using 
      statistical parametric mapping. No significant relationships between COMT genotype 
      groups and frontal lobe activations were observed for any contrast of the three 
      tasks studied. However, the val/val group produced significantly greater 
      deactivation of the right posterior cingulate cortex in two tasks: the Go-NoGo (NoGo 
      vs Go deactivation contrast) and N-Back (2-back vs rest deactivation contrast). For 
      the N-Back task, the modulated deactivation cluster was functionally connected to 
      the precuneus, left middle occipital lobe, and cerebellum. These results do not 
      support findings of prefrontal cortical modulation of activity with COMT genotype, 
      but instead suggest that COMT val/val genotype can modulate the activity of the 
      posterior cingulate and may indicate the potential network effects of COMT genotype 
      on the default mode network.

TI  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging brain mapping in psychiatry: methodological 
      issues illustrated in a study of working memory in schizophrenia.
PG  - 186-96
AB  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a potential paradigm shift in 
      psychiatric neuroimaging. The technique provides individual, rather than 
      group-averaged, functional neuroimaging data, but subtle methodological confounds 
      represent unique challenges for psychiatric research. As an exemplar of the unique 
      potential and problems of fMRI, we present a study of 10 inpatients with 
      schizophrenia and 10 controls performing a novel "n back" working memory (WM) task. 
      We emphasize two key design steps: (1) the use of an internal activation standard 
      (i.e., a physiological control region) to address activation validity, and (2) the 
      assessment of signal stability to control for "activation" artifacts arising from 
      unequal signal variance across groups. In the initial analysis, all but one of the 
      patients failed to activate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during the 
      working memory task. However, some patients (and one control) also tended to show 
      sparse control region activation in spite of normal motor performance, a result that 
      raises doubts about the validity of the initial analysis and concerns about unequal 
      subject motion. Subjects were then matched for signal variance (voxel stability), 
      producing a subset of six patients and six controls. In this comparison, the 
      internal activation standard (i.e., motor activation) was similar in both groups, 
      and five of six patients, including two whom were neuroleptic-naive, failed to 
      activate DLPFC. In addition, a tendency for overactivation of parietal cortex was 
      seen. These results illustrate some of the promise and pitfalls of fMRI. Although 
      fMRI generates individual brain maps, a specialized survey of the data is necessary 
      to avoid spurious or unreliable findings, related to artifacts such as motion, which 
      are likely to be frequent in psychiatric patients.

TI  - The effect of ANK3 bipolar-risk polymorphisms on the working memory circuitry 
      differs between loci and according to risk-status for bipolar disorder.
PG  - 188-96
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.32294 [doi]
AB  - Polymorphisms at the rs10994336 and rs9804190 loci of the Ankyrin 3 (ANK3) gene have 
      been strongly associated with increased risk for bipolar disorder (BD). However, 
      their potential pathogenetic effect on BD-relevant neural circuits remains unknown. 
      We examined the effect of BD-risk polymorphisms at rs10994336 and rs9804190 on the 
      working memory (WM) circuit using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data 
      obtained from euthymic patients with BD (n = 41), their psychiatrically healthy 
      first-degree relatives (n = 25) and unrelated individuals without personal or family 
      history of psychiatric disorders (n = 46) while performing the N-back task. In 
      unrelated healthy individuals, the rs10994336-risk-allele was associated with 
      reduced activation of the ventral visual cortical components of the WM circuit while 
      the rs9804190-risk-allele was associated with inefficient hyperactivation of the 
      prefrontal cortical components of the WM. In patients and their healthy relatives, 
      risk alleles at either loci were associated with hyperactivation in the ventral 
      anterior cingulate cortex. Additionally, Rs9804190-risk-allele carriers with BD 
      evidenced abnormal hyperactivation within the posterior cingulate cortex. This study 
      provides new insights on the neurogenetic correlates of allelic variation at 
      different genome-wide supported BD-risk associated ANK3 loci that support their 
      involvement in BD and highlight the modulatory influence of increased background 
      genetic risk for BD.

TI  - He who is well prepared has half won the battle: an FMRI study of task preparation.
PG  - 726-35
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bht262 [doi]
AB  - The neural mechanism underlying preparation for tasks that vary in difficulty has 
      not been explored. This functional magnetic resonance imaging study manipulated task 
      difficulty by varying the working memory (WM) load of the n-back task. Each n-back 
      task block was preceded by a preparation period involving a screen that indicated 
      the level of difficulty of the upcoming task. Consistent with previous work, 
      activation in some brain regions depended on WM load in the task. These regions were 
      used as regions of interest for the univariate and multivariate (classification) 
      analyses of preparation periods. The findings were that the patterns of brain 
      activation during task preparation contain information about the upcoming task 
      difficulty. (1) A support vector machine classifier was able to decode the n-back 
      task difficulty from the patterns of brain activation during task preparation. Those 
      individuals whose activation patterns for anticipated 1- versus 2- versus 3-back 
      conditions were classified with higher accuracy showed better behavioral performance 
      on the task, suggesting that task performance depends on task preparation. (2) Left 
      inferior frontal gyrus, intraparietal sulcus, and anterior cingulate cortex 
      parametrically decreased activation as anticipated task difficulty increased. Taken 
      together, these results suggest dynamic involvement of the WM network not only 
      during WM task performance, but also during task preparation.

TI  - Greater BOLD activity but more efficient connectivity is associated with better 
      cognitive performance within a sample of nicotine-deprived smokers.
PG  - 931-40
LID - 10.1111/adb.12060 [doi]
AB  - The first few days of an attempt to quit smoking are marked by impairments in 
      cognitive domains, such as working memory and attention. These cognitive impairments 
      have been linked to increased risk for relapse. Little is known about individual 
      differences in the cognitive impairments that accompany deprivation or the neural 
      processing reflected in those differences. In order to address this knowledge gap, 
      we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 118 
      nicotine-deprived smokers while they performed a verbal n-back task. We predicted 
      better performance would be associated with more efficient patterns of brain 
      activation and effective connectivity. Results indicated that performance was 
      positively related to load-related activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal 
      cortex and the left lateral premotor cortex. Additionally, effective connectivity 
      patterns differed as a function of performance, with more accurate participants 
      having simpler, more parsimonious network models than did worse participants. 
      Cognitive efficiency is typically thought of as less neural activation for equal or 
      superior behavioral performance. Taken together, findings suggest cognitive 
      efficiency should not be viewed solely in terms of amount of activation but that 
      both the magnitude of activation within and degree of covariation between 
      task-critical structures must be considered. This research highlights the benefit of 
      combining traditional fMRI analysis with newer methods for modeling brain 
      connectivity. These results suggest a possible role for indices of network 
      functioning in assessing relapse risk in quitting smokers as well as offer 
      potentially useful targets for novel intervention strategies.

TI  - An fMRI study of prefrontal brain activation during multiple tasks in patients with 
      major depressive disorder.
PG  - 490-501
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous research has provided conflicting information regarding the 
      pattern of brain activation associated with cognitive performance in depressed 
      people. We aimed to assess brain activation related to cognitive performance during 
      planning and working memory tasks. METHOD: fMRI scans were conducted using a 
      modified Tower of London task and a 2-back task in 13 patients with major depressive 
      disorder and a matched control group. RESULTS: Task performance was impaired in the 
      depressed group on the Tower of London task but there were no differences between 
      the groups in task performance on the n-back task. The patient group showed 
      widespread increased brain activation in both tasks. There was considerable overlap 
      in increased activation between the two tasks, especially in right prefrontal 
      cortical regions. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with depression exhibit increased brain 
      activation, especially in right prefrontal regions, across several types of 
      cognitive task activity. Patients with depression may recruit greater brain regions 
      to achieve similar or even poorer task performance than control subjects.

TI  - Abnormal prefrontal activity subserving attentional control of emotion in remitted 
      depressed patients during a working memory task with emotional distracters.
PG  - 29-40
LID - 10.1017/S0033291711001097 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) show deficits in 
      processing of facial emotions that persist beyond recovery and cessation of 
      treatment. Abnormalities in neural areas supporting attentional control and emotion 
      processing in remitted depressed (rMDD) patients suggests that there may be 
      enduring, trait-like abnormalities in key neural circuits at the interface of 
      cognition and emotion, but this issue has not been studied systematically. METHOD: 
      Nineteen euthymic, medication-free rMDD patients (mean age 33.6 years; mean duration 
      of illness 34 months) and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC; mean age 
      35.8 years) performed the Emotional Face N-Back (EFNBACK) task, a working memory 
      task with emotional distracter stimuli. We used blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure neural activity in the 
      dorsolateral (DLPFC) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), orbitofrontal 
      cortex (OFC), ventral striatum and amygdala, using a region of interest (ROI) 
      approach in SPM2. RESULTS: rMDD patients exhibited significantly greater activity 
      relative to HC in the left DLPFC [Brodmann area (BA) 9/46] in response to negative 
      emotional distracters during high working memory load. By contrast, rMDD patients 
      exhibited significantly lower activity in the right DLPFC and left VLPFC compared to 
      HC in response to positive emotional distracters during high working memory load. 
      These effects occurred during accurate task performance. CONCLUSIONS: Remitted 
      depressed patients may continue to exhibit attentional biases toward negative 
      emotional information, reflected by greater recruitment of prefrontal regions 
      implicated in attentional control in the context of negative emotional information.

AB  - There has been little investigation of the effects of past substance abuse (SA) on 
      working memory (WM) impairments in schizophrenia. This study examined the behavioral 
      and neurobiological impact of past SA (6 months or longer abstinence period) on WM 
      in schizophrenia. Thirty-seven schizophrenia patients (17 with past SA and 20 
      without) and 32 controls (12 with past SA and 20 without) completed two versions of 
      a two-back WM task during fMRI scanning on separate days. Analyses focused on 
      regions whose patterns of activation replicated across both n-back tasks. 
      Schizophrenia patients were significantly less accurate than controls on both n-back 
      tasks. No main effects or interactions with past SA on WM performance were observed. 
      However, several fronto-parietal-thalamic regions showed an interaction between 
      diagnostic group and past SA. These regions were significantly more active in 
      controls with past SA compared to controls without past SA. Schizophrenia patients 
      with or without past SA either showed no significant differences, or patients with 
      past SA showed somewhat less activation compared to patients without past SA during 
      WM. These results suggest robust effects of past SA on WM brain functioning in 
      controls, but less impact of past SA in schizophrenia. This is consistent with 
      previous literature indicating less impaired neurocognition in schizophrenia with 
      SA.

TI  - Physiological characteristics of capacity constraints in working memory as revealed 
      by functional MRI.
PG  - 20-6
AB  - A fundamental characteristic of working memory is that its capacity to handle 
      information is limited. While there have been many brain mapping studies of working 
      memory, the physiological basis of its capacity limitation has not been explained. 
      We identified characteristics of working memory capacity using functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy subjects. Working memory capacity was studied 
      using a parametric 'n-back' working memory task involving increasing cognitive load 
      and ultimately decreasing task performance. Loci within dorsolateral prefrontal 
      cortex (DLPFC) evinced exclusively an 'inverted-U' shaped neurophysiological 
      response from lowest to highest load, consistent with a capacity-constrained 
      response. Regions outside of DLPFC, in contrast, were more heterogeneous in response 
      and often showed early plateau or continuously increasing responses, which did not 
      reflect capacity constraints. However, sporadic loci, including in the premotor 
      cortex, thalamus and superior parietal lobule, also demonstrated putative 
      capacity-constrained responses, perhaps arising as an upstream effect of DLPFC 
      limitations or as part of a broader network-wide capacity limitation. These results 
      demonstrate that regionally specific nodes within the working memory network are 
      capacity-constrained in the physiological domain, providing a missing link in 
      current explorations of the capacity characteristics of working memory.

TI  - A truly simultaneous combination of functional transcranial Doppler sonography and 
      H(2)(15)O PET adds fundamental new information on differences in cognitive 
      activation between schizophrenics and healthy control subjects.
PG  - 671-81
AB  - Working memory deficits are a cardinal feature of the pathophysiology of 
      schizophrenia. Lesion studies and functional blood flow-dependent imaging methods 
      with coarse temporal resolution, such as PET and functional MRI (fMRI), tend to 
      paint a fairly static picture of the cortical regions involved. In contrast, 
      functional transcranial Doppler sonography (fTCD) provides a high temporal 
      resolution. Truly simultaneous fTCD-fMRI is not yet possible for technical reasons, 
      but H(2)(15)O PET and fTCD can be used really simultaneously. However, this 
      combination has not yet been used for cognitive activations in schizophrenia. We 
      therefore investigated the extent to which there are both spatial (PET) and temporal 
      changes (fTCD) in the activation patterns of schizophrenic patients. METHODS: Eleven 
      clinically stable chronic schizophrenic, right-handed patients and 10 healthy, 
      right-handed control subjects, matched for age, sex, education, and intelligence 
      quotient, participated in the study. We selected stable chronic schizophrenic 
      patients who could perform a working memory task (N-back task) as well as healthy 
      volunteers to exclude the possibility of imaged artifacts due to poor performance. 
      All subjects were examined with a truly simultaneous fTCD-H(2)(15)O PET combination 
      under cognitive activation. RESULTS: Schizophrenic patients activate a significantly 
      larger cortical volume for adequate task performance (P < 0.05), but with a 
      significantly lower blood flow increase in this volume (P < 0.01), than do control 
      subjects. Furthermore, they cannot significantly increase blood flow velocity during 
      the time course of cognitive activation as control subjects do. There were only 
      significant correlations between neuropsychologic performance and imaging parameters 
      (fTCD changes, PET blood flow changes) in control subjects (all r >or= /0.65/; P < 
      0.05), but no significant correlations in schizophrenics (all r < /0.3/; P > 0.4). 
      CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that schizophrenic patients exhibit qualitative 
      differences in the spatial and temporal resolution of cognitive processing. All 
      facts could be interpreted as a sign of alternative, less efficient problem-solving 
      strategies in schizophrenia that lead to the working memory deficits observed during 
      the further course of this disease. Truly simultaneous fTCD-PET can be used in 
      neuroscience to add fundamental new information on spatial and temporal cognitive 
      activation behavior to understand the true physiologic nature of the 
      disease-specific differences of mental illnesses that are seen as disorders of the 
      mind arising in the brain.

LID - 10.1002/hbm.22382 [doi]
AB  - Neuroimaging studies have consistently shown that working memory (WM) tasks engage a 
      distributed neural network that primarily includes the dorsolateral prefrontal 
      cortex, the parietal cortex, and the anterior cingulate cortex. The current 
      challenge is to provide a mechanistic account of the changes observed in regional 
      activity. To achieve this, we characterized neuroplastic responses in effective 
      connectivity between these regions at increasing WM loads using dynamic causal 
      modeling of functional magnetic resonance imaging data obtained from healthy 
      individuals during a verbal n-back task. Our data demonstrate that increasing memory 
      load was associated with (a) right-hemisphere dominance, (b) increasing forward 
      (i.e., posterior to anterior) effective connectivity within the WM network, and (c) 
      reduction in individual variability in WM network architecture resulting in the 
      right-hemisphere forward model reaching an exceedance probability of 99% in the most 
      demanding condition. Our results provide direct empirical support that task 
      difficulty, in our case WM load, is a significant moderator of short-term 
      plasticity, complementing existing theories of task-related reduction in variability 
      in neural networks.

TI  - Effects of acute antipsychotic treatment on brain activation in first episode 
      psychosis: an fMRI study.
PG  - 492-500
AB  - This study aimed to assess the neurophysiological effects of acute atypical 
      antipsychotic treatment on cognitive functioning in subjects presenting with a first 
      episode of psychosis. We used functional MRI to examine the modulatory effects of 
      acute psychopharmacological intervention on brain activation during four different 
      cognitive tasks: overt verbal fluency, random movement generation, n-back and a 
      spatial object memory task. Treatment with atypical antipsychotics was associated 
      with alterations in regional activation during each task and also when task demands 
      were manipulated within paradigms. The initial treatment of psychosis with atypical 
      antipsychotics thus appears to be associated with modifications of the 
      neurofunctional correlates of executive and mnemonic functions. These effects need 
      to be considered when interpreting group differences in activation between medicated 
      patients and controls.

TI  - De-coupling of cognitive performance and cerebral functional response during working 
      memory in schizophrenia.
PG  - 45-56
AB  - Working memory dysfunction is considered to be fundamental to the cognitive and 
      clinical features evident in schizophrenia. Functional neuroimaging studies have 
      begun to elucidate the neurobiological basis of such deficits, however, 
      interpretation of these studies may be confounded by performance impairment, when 
      the cognitive load exceeds the limited response capacity of patients with 
      schizophrenia. In this study, patients were pre-selected on the basis of intact 
      performance on a relatively low-load verbal working memory task, in order to 
      mitigate against performance confounds. Subjects included 20 right-handed male 
      subjects with chronic schizophrenia, and 20 right-handed, age-matched, male healthy 
      controls, without personal or familial psychiatric history. All subjects underwent 
      fMRI scanning whilst performing a verbal n-back task. There were no significant 
      between-group differences in target identification; the patient group showed a 
      significantly increased mean response latency. Both groups demonstrated robust 
      fronto-parietal activation. In the control subjects, the power of functional 
      response was positively correlated with reaction time in bilateral posterior 
      parietal cortex, however, this coupling of behavioural performance and cerebral 
      response was not evident in the patients. This deficit, apparent within the 
      performance capacity of the patients, may represent a fundamental abnormality in 
      schizophrenia, and may compromise performance at higher cognitive loads.

      bipolar patient.
PG  - 181-4
LID - 10.1159/000346654 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some functional imaging abnormalities found in bipolar disorder are 
      state related, whereas others persist into euthymia. It is uncertain to what extent 
      these latter changes may reflect continuing subsyndromal affective fluctuations and 
      whether those can be modulated by therapeutic interventions. METHOD: We report 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) findings during performance of the 
      n-back working memory task in a bipolar patient who showed a marked improvement in 
      subsyndromal affective symptoms after receiving eye movement desensitization and 
      reprocessing (EMDR) therapy in the context of a clinical trial. RESULTS: The 
      patient's clinical improvement was accompanied by marked changes in functional 
      imaging, as compared to 30 healthy subjects. fMRI changes were noted particularly in 
      deactivation, with failure of deactivation in the medial frontal cortex partially 
      normalizing after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This case supports the potential 
      therapeutic overall benefit of EMDR in traumatized bipolar patients and suggests a 
      possible neurobiological mechanism of action: normalization of default mode network 
      dysfunction.

      preliminary FMRI investigation.

LID - 10.1007/s11682-009-9072-5 [doi]
AB  - As part of a preliminary investigation on the effects of methylphenidate on brain 
      activation during a working memory (WM) task in patients with traumatic brain injury 
      (TBI), patients with TBI received 15 mg of methylphenidate (N = 4) or placebo 
      (N = 5) twice a day for one month in a double-blind, placebo-controlled design. 
      Brain activation was assessed at pre-treatment and on the final treatment day using 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with an N-back task using faces as 
      stimuli. In a whole brain voxel-wise analysis, methylphenidate, compared to placebo, 
      produced a decrease in brain activation for the 2-load minus 0-load contrast in the 
      anterior cingulate, thalamus, cuneus and cerebellum, regions associated with WM 
      performance. Further, an a priori region of interest analysis with small volume 
      correction found reduced activation in the anterior cingulate. Although based on a 
      small sample size, these preliminary findings suggest methylphenidate may increase 
      processing efficiency associated with cognitive control during WM tasks in patients 
      with TBI.

TI  - The effect of moderate acute psychological stress on working memory-related neural 
      activity is modulated by a genetic variation in catecholaminergic function in 
      humans.

AB  - Acute stress has an important impact on higher-order cognitive functions supported 
      by the prefrontal cortex (PFC) such as working memory (WM). In rodents, such effects 
      are mediated by stress-induced alterations in catecholaminergic signaling, but human 
      data in support of this notion is lacking. A common variation in the gene encoding 
      Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is known to affect basal catecholaminergic 
      availability and PFC functions. Here, we investigated whether this genetic variation 
      (Val158Met) modulates effects of stress on WM-related neural activity in humans. In 
      a counterbalanced crossover design, 41 healthy young men underwent functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a numerical N-back WM task 
      embedded in a stressful or neutral context. Moderate psychological stress was 
      induced by a well-controlled procedure involving viewing strongly aversive (versus 
      emotionally neutral) movie material in combination with a self-referencing 
      instruction. Acute stress resulted in genotype-dependent effects on WM performance 
      and WM-related activation in the dorsolateral PFC, with a relatively negative impact 
      of stress in COMT Met-homozygotes as opposed to a relatively positive effect in 
      Val-carriers. A parallel interaction was found for WM-related deactivation in the 
      anterior medial temporal lobe (MTL). Our findings suggest that individuals with 
      higher baseline catecholaminergic availability (COMT Met-homozygotes) appear to 
      reach a supraoptimal state under moderate levels of stress. In contrast, individuals 
      with lower baselines (Val-carriers) may reach an optimal state. Thus, our data show 
      that effects of acute stress on higher-order cognitive functions vary depending on 
      catecholaminergic availability at baseline, and thereby corroborate animal models of 
      catecholaminergic signaling that propose a non-linear relationship between 
      catecholaminergic activity and prefrontal functions.

TI  - Compensatory activations in patients with multiple sclerosis during preserved 
      performance on the auditory N-back task.
PG  - 424-30
AB  - Recent fMRI studies have suggested that multiple sclerosis (MS) patients show 
      adaptive cortical changes (i.e., compensatory mechanisms) during motor and cognitive 
      tasks to limit the clinical impact of tissue injury. In this study, we investigated 
      the activation pattern during the auditory n-back working memory (WM) paradigm in a 
      group of 17 MS patients and 10 healthy controls with preserved performance in WM 
      tasks. Compared with healthy controls, MS patients showed significantly greater 
      bilateral activation in prefrontal cortex (BA 44), and the insula. These findings 
      were similar to those obtained in previous studies showing that compensatory 
      mechanisms during WM tasks in MS may be based on the use of prefrontal areas 
      adjacent to those involved in the task.

TI  - Increased brain activation during working memory in cognitively intact adults with 
      the APOE epsilon4 allele.
PG  - 1603-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Altered patterns of brain activity during cognitive tasks have been 
      demonstrated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in mild cognitive 
      impairment and Alzheimer's disease. However, there have been few studies of adults 
      at genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease prior to the onset of symptoms. The purpose 
      of this study was to determine whether brain activation patterns associated with 
      working memory differ as a function of apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype in 
      cognitively intact adults. METHOD: Participants were cognitively intact, healthy 
      adults who completed genotyping, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and 
      structural and functional neuroimaging. Twenty-two participants had the APOE 
      epsilon3/epsilon3 genotype, and 13 participants had the APOE epsilon3/epsilon4 
      genotype. The study employed an auditory verbal N-back task to probe working 
      memory-related brain activity. RESULTS: The epsilon3/epsilon3 and epsilon3/epsilon4 
      groups did not differ in demographic characteristics, cognitive ability, mood, or 
      in-scanner task performance. The epsilon3/epsilon4 group showed greater activity 
      during working memory in the medial frontal and parietal regions bilaterally and in 
      the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. There were no regions in which the 
      epsilon3/epsilon3 group showed greater activation than the epsilon3/epsilon4 group. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that differences in brain activity are evident 
      in cognitively intact individuals who are at risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease 
      by virtue of their APOE allele status. As neuroprotective interventions become 
      available, early detection will increase in importance. The combination of genetic 
      and functional neuroimaging strategies may prove useful for monitoring individuals 
      at risk for Alzheimer's disease before the onset of cognitive symptoms.

AB  - Intracellular iron is essential for many neurobiological mechanisms. However, at 
      high concentrations, iron may induce oxidative stress and inflammation. Brain iron 
      overload has been shown in various neurodegenerative disorders and in normal aging. 
      Elevated brain iron in old age may trigger brain dysfunction and concomitant 
      cognitive decline. However, the exact mechanism underlying the deleterious impact of 
      iron on brain function in aging is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of iron 
      on brain function across the adult lifespan from 187 healthy participants (20-79 
      years old, 99 women) who underwent fMRI scanning while performing a working-memory 
      n-back task. Iron content was quantified using R2* relaxometry, whereas 
      neuroinflammation was estimated using myo-inositol measured by magnetic resonance 
      spectroscopy. Striatal iron increased non-linearly with age, with linear increases 
      at both ends of adulthood. Whereas higher frontostriatal activity was related to 
      better memory performance independent of age, the link between brain activity and 
      iron differed across age groups. Higher striatal iron was linked to greater 
      frontostriatal activity in younger, but reduced activity in older adults. Further 
      mediation analysis revealed that, after age 40, iron provided unique and shared 
      contributions with neuroinflammation to brain activations, such that 
      neuroinflammation partly mediated brain-iron associations. These findings promote a 
      novel mechanistic understanding of how iron may exert deleterious effects on brain 
      function and cognition with advancing age.

AB  - In the domain of working memory (WM), a sigmoid-shaped relationship between WM load 
      and brain activation patterns has been demonstrated in younger adults. It has been 
      suggested that age-related alterations of this pattern are associated with changes 
      in neural efficiency and capacity. At the same time, WM training studies have shown 
      that some older adults are able to increase their WM performance through training. 
      In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging during an n-back WM task at 
      different WM load levels was applied to compare blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) 
      responses between younger and older participants and to predict gains in WM 
      performance after a subsequent 12-session WM training procedure in older adults. We 
      show that increased neural efficiency and capacity, as reflected by more 
      "youth-like" brain response patterns in regions of interest of the frontoparietal WM 
      network, were associated with better behavioral training outcome beyond the effects 
      of age, sex, education, gray matter volume, and baseline WM performance. 
      Furthermore, at low difficulty levels, decreases in BOLD response were found after 
      WM training. Results indicate that both neural efficiency (i.e., decreased 
      activation at comparable performance levels) and capacity (i.e., increasing 
      activation with increasing WM load) of a WM-related network predict plasticity of 
      the WM system, whereas WM training may specifically increase neural efficiency in 
      older adults.

AB  - Prolonged exposure to socioeconomic hardship (SH) is associated with greater delayed 
      reward discounting (DRD), a form of impulsive decision-making that reflects a 
      reduced capacity to delay gratification and a significant correlate of diverse risk 
      behaviors, but the neurobehavioral mechanisms linking SH and DRD are unknown. An 
      emerging hypothesis suggests that cognitive and affective stress associated with 
      poverty may tax neurocognitive functions, such as working memory (WM), and lead to 
      impulsive DRD. Furthermore, research suggests that emotional reactivity (ER) is an 
      important dispositional factor to consider in the link between executive functions 
      and DRD. Thus, we longitudinally examined the indirect effect of SH on impulsive DRD 
      via a network of brain regions associated with WM function in a sample of young 
      adults, and whether that link was moderated by ER. Participants were 119 rural 
      African Americans (aged 19-24 years) assessed behaviorally on four occasions, with 
      fMRI at the last time point. Results showed that, among emerging adults with higher 
      ER, SH severity was predictive of increased DRD via reduced response in brain 
      regions activated during an n-back WM task. These findings reveal both the cognitive 
      and affective mechanisms that underlie the relationship between SH and DRD.

TI  - Intrinsic connections between thalamic sub-regions and the lateral prefrontal cortex 
      are differentially impacted by acute methylphenidate.
PG  - 1873-1883
LID - 10.1007/s00213-020-05505-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The thalamus is a major target of dopaminergic projections and is 
      densely connected with the prefrontal cortex. A better understanding of how dopamine 
      changes thalamo-cortical communication may shed light on how dopamine supports 
      cognitive function. Methylphenidate has been shown to facilitate cognitive 
      processing and reduce connectivity between the thalamus and lateral prefrontal 
      cortex. AIMS: The thalamus is a heterogeneous structure, and the present study 
      sought to clarify how the intrinsic connections of thalamic sub-regions are 
      differentially impacted by acute dopamine transporter blockade. METHODS: Sixty 
      healthy volunteers were orally administered either 20 mg of methylphenidate (N = 29) 
      or placebo (N = 31) in a double-blind, randomized, between-subject design. 
      Multi-echo fMRI was used to assess intrinsic functional connectivity of sub-regions 
      of the thalamus during a resting state scan. An N-back working-memory paradigm 
      provided a measure of cognitive performance. RESULTS: Acute methylphenidate 
      significantly reduced connectivity of the lateral prefrontal cortex with the motor 
      and somatosensory sub-regions of the thalamus and reduced connectivity with the 
      parietal and visual sub-regions at a trend level. Connectivity with the premotor, 
      prefrontal, and temporal sub-regions was not impacted. The intrinsic connectivity 
      between the thalamus and the lateral prefrontal cortex was not associated with 
      working-memory performance. CONCLUSIONS: Methylphenidate decreases functional 
      connections between the lateral prefrontal cortex and thalamus broadly, while 
      sparing intrinsic connectivity with thalamic sub-regions involved with 
      working-memory and language related processes. Collectively, our results suggest 
      that the dopamine transporter regulates functional connections between the 
      prefrontal cortex and non-cognitive areas of the thalamus.

AB  - Working memory (WM) declines with age. Older adults, however, perform similar to 
      younger adults in WM tasks with negative distractors at low WM load. To clarify the 
      neural basis of this phenomenon, older (n = 28) and younger (n = 24) adults 
      performed an emotional n-back task during an fMRI scan, and activity in task-related 
      regions was examined. Comparing negative with neutral distraction at low WM load, 
      older adults demonstrated shorter reaction times (RT) and reduced activation in 
      frontoparietal regions: bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and left parietal 
      cortex. They also had greater coherence within the frontoparietal network, as well 
      as greater deactivation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala. 
      These patterns probably contributed to the older adults' diminished distractibility 
      by negative task-irrelevant stimuli. Since recruitment of control mechanisms was 
      less required, the frontoparietal network was less activated and performance was 
      improved. Faster RT during the negative condition was related to lesser activation 
      of the MFG in both age groups, corroborating the functional significance of this 
      region to WM across the lifespan.

AB  - The neuropeptide S (NPS) and its receptor NPSR have captured attention in the 
      pathogenesis of anxiety disorders. Here, a functional polymorphism in the NPSR1 gene 
      has been linked to deviant cortico-limbic interactions in response to negative 
      stimuli. While healthy T allele carriers exhibited increased amygdala and prefrontal 
      cortex activity, panic disorder patients carrying the T risk allele displayed 
      hypofrontality possibly reflecting insufficient prefrontal inhibition of limbic 
      reactivity. In order to study multi-level effects of genotype and anxiety, 
      prefrontal cortex activity during an emotional n-back task was measured in 66 
      volunteers genotyped for the NPSR1 rs324981 A/T variant (AA homozygotes vs. T allele 
      carriers) by means of functional near-infrared spectroscopy. For a high working 
      memory load (3-back), T allele carriers showed a signal increase to negative 
      pictures in the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex while AA homozygotes 
      displayed a signal decrease. Since groups did not differ on skin conductance level 
      and behavioral parameters, this effect in the risk group in line with results from 
      fMRI studies is speculated to represent an adaptive mechanism to compensate for 
      presumably increased subcortical activity driven by an overactive NPS system. 
      However, anxiety sensitivity correlated negatively with prefrontal activity in T 
      allele carriers possibly suggesting a decompensation of the adaptive compensatory 
      upregulation.

TI  - Cognitive effects of nicotine in humans: an fMRI study.
PG  - 1002-13
AB  - To elucidate the neural correlates of cognitive effects of nicotine, we examined 
      behavioral performance and blood oxygenation level-dependent regional brain 
      activity, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, during a parametric "n-back" 
      task in healthy nonsmoking males after the administration of nicotine (12 microg/kg 
      body weight) or saline. Nicotine, compared to placebo, improved accuracy (P = 0.008) 
      in all active conditions (2%-11%), and had a load-specific effect on latency (P = 
      0.004; 43.78% decrease at the highest memory load). Within a network of parietal and 
      frontal areas activated by the task (P < 0.05, corrected at the voxel level), 
      nicotine produced an increased response (P < 0.05; uncorrected within the regions of 
      interest) in the anterior cingulate, superior frontal cortex, and superior parietal 
      cortex. It also produced an increased response in the midbrain tectum in all active 
      conditions and in the parahippocampal gyrus, cerebellum, and medial occipital lobe 
      during rest (P = 0.05; uncorrected). The present observations point to altered 
      neuronal activity in a distributed neural network associated with on-line task 
      monitoring and attention and arousal systems as underlying nicotine-related 
      enhancement of attention and working memory in human subjects.

AB  - Frontal and striatal areas are the neuroanatomical basis for working memory (WM), as 
      well as targets for sex steroids. However, up to date little is known regarding 
      menstrual cycle (MC) effects on brain activation and connectivity patterns during 
      verbal WM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal dataset to 
      study dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, putamen and caudate activation and 
      connectivity patterns during a verbal WM task along the natural MC. Thirty-nine 
      naturally cycling healthy women were scanned three times locked to their MC (menses, 
      pre-ovulatory and luteal phase). They performed an N-back task with two trial types, 
      targets and lures, assessing (i) updating and (ii) inhibitory process respectively. 
      Distinct patterns of fronto-striatal activation and connectivity changes were 
      observed for each process. (i) For targets, we observed decreased connectivity 
      between left striatum- and inferior frontal and parietal areas, the circuit 
      underlying phonological WM, in response to elevated progesterone during the luteal 
      phase. Simultaneously, we observed an alleviation of inhibition from fronto-striatal 
      areas on areas related to higher cognitive effort and the salience network. (ii) For 
      lures, negative inter-hemispheric connectivity between fronto-parietal areas during 
      the pre-ovulatory phase, as well as increased connectivity between bilateral 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posteromedial structures during the luteal phase. 
      Overall, we corroborated a hormone mediated inter-hemispheric decoupling, enhanced 
      frontal activity and disinhibition of the salience brain network and striatum during 
      the luteal phase. In summary, we interpret these results in relation to a 
      differential top-down regulation in higher hormone levels phases and hyperactive 
      bottom-up network during the luteal phase, which could explain the vulnerability of 
      this phase to MC associated disorders.

TI  - Context dependent differences in working memory related brain activity in heavy 
      cannabis users.
LID - 10.1007/s00213-021-05956-y [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Compromised cognitive control in cannabis use-tempting situations is 
      thought to play a key role in the development of cannabis use disorders. However, 
      little is known about how exposure to cannabis cues and contexts may influence 
      cognitive control and the underlying neural mechanisms in cannabis users. 
      OBJECTIVES: Working memory (WM) is an attention reliant executive function central 
      to cognitive control. In this study, we investigated how distracting cannabis words 
      affected WM load-dependent performance and related brain activity in near-daily 
      cannabis users (N = 36) relative to controls (N = 33). METHODS: Brain activity was 
      recorded during a novel N-back flanker WM task with neutral and cannabis flankers 
      added as task-irrelevant distractors. RESULTS: On a behavioural level, WM 
      performance did not differ between groups, and the presence of cannabis flankers did 
      not affect performance. However, in cannabis users compared to controls, the 
      presence of cannabis flankers reduced WM load-related activity in multiple regions, 
      including the insula, thalamus, superior parietal lobe and supramarginal gyrus. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The group specificity of these effects suggest that cannabis users 
      might differ from controls in the way they process cannabis-related cues and that 
      cannabis cue exposure could interfere with other cognitive processes under 
      cognitively demanding circumstances. Future studies should focus on the role of 
      context in cognitive control-related processes like WM and attention to further 
      elucidate potential cognitive impairments in heavy cannabis users and how these 
      relate to loss of control over drug seeking itself.

LID - 10.1111/bdi.12517 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Neuroimaging studies have revealed evidence of brain functional 
      abnormalities in bipolar depressive disorder (BDD) and major depressive disorder 
      (MDD). However, few studies to date have compared these two mood disorders directly. 
      METHODS: Matched groups of 26 BDD type I patients, 26 MDD patients and 26 healthy 
      controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing the 
      n-back working memory task. A whole-brain ANOVA was used to compare the three groups 
      and clusters of significant difference were examined further using 
      region-of-interest (ROI) analysis. RESULTS: The whole-brain ANOVA revealed a single 
      cluster of significant difference in the medial frontal cortex. The BDD and MDD 
      patients both showed failure to deactivate in this area compared to the controls. 
      The BDD patients showed significantly greater failure of deactivation than the MDD 
      patients, which was not accounted for by differences in severity or chronicity of 
      illness between them. CONCLUSIONS: Failure of deactivation, considered to reflect 
      default mode network dysfunction, is present to a greater extent in bipolar than 
      unipolar depression. The study of this network may be useful in the search for brain 
      markers that distinguish the two disorders.

PG  - 32-7
AB  - Cognitive abilities such as working memory (WM) capacity decrease with age. To 
      determine the neurophysiological correlates of age-related reduction in working 
      memory capacity, we studied 10 young subjects (<35 years of age; mean age=29) and 
      twelve older subjects (>55 years of age; mean age=59) with whole brain blood 
      oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) fMRI on a 1.5 T GE MR scanner using a SPIRAL 
      FLASH pulse sequence (TE=24 ms, TR=56 ms, FA=60 degrees , voxel dimensions=3.75 
      mm(3)). Subjects performed a modified version of the "n" back working memory task at 
      different levels of increasing working memory load (1-Back, 2-Back and 3-Back). 
      Older subjects performed as well as the younger subjects at 1-Back (p=0.4), but 
      performed worse than the younger subjects at 2-Back (p<0.01) and 3-Back (p=0.06). 
      Older subjects had significantly longer reaction time (RT) than younger subjects 
      (p<0.04) at all levels of task difficulty. Image analysis using SPM 99 revealed a 
      similar distribution of cortical activity between younger and older subjects at all 
      task levels. However, an analysis of variance revealed a significant group x task 
      interaction in the prefrontal cortex bilaterally; within working memory capacity, as 
      in 1-Back when the older subjects performed as well as the younger subjects, they 
      showed greater prefrontal cortical (BA 9) activity bilaterally. At higher working 
      memory loads, however, when they performed worse then the younger subjects, the 
      older subjects showed relatively reduced activity in these prefrontal regions. These 
      data suggest that, within capacity, compensatory mechanisms such as additional 
      prefrontal cortical activity are called upon to maintain proficiency in task 
      performance. As cognitive demand increases, however, they are pushed past a 
      threshold beyond which physiological compensation cannot be made and, a decline in 
      performance occurs.

TI  - Functional imaging in youth at risk for transdiagnostic serious mental illness: 
      Initial results from the PROCAN study.
PG  - 1276-1291
LID - 10.1111/eip.13078 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In their early stages, serious mental illnesses (SMIs) are often 
      indistinguishable from one another, suggesting that studying alterations in brain 
      activity in a transdiagnostic fashion could help to understand the 
      neurophysiological origins of different SMI. The purpose of this study was to 
      examine brain activity in youth at varying stages of risk for SMI using functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging tasks (fMRI) that engage brain systems believed to be 
      affected. METHODS: Two hundred and forty three participants at different stages of 
      risk for SMI were recruited to the Canadian Psychiatric Risk and Outcome (PROCAN) 
      study, however only 179 were scanned. Stages included asymptomatic participants at 
      no elevated risk, asymptomatic participants at elevated risk due to family history, 
      participants with undifferentiated general symptoms of mental illness, and those 
      experiencing attenuated versions of diagnosable psychiatric illnesses. The fMRI 
      tasks included: (1) a monetary incentive delay task; (2) an emotional Go-NoGo and 
      (3) an n-back working memory task. RESULTS: Strong main effects with each of the 
      tasks were found in brain regions previously described in the literature. However, 
      there were no significant differences in brain activity between any of the stages of 
      risk for SMI for any of the task contrasts, after accounting for site, sex and age. 
      Furthermore, results indicated no significant differences even when participants 
      were dichotomized as asymptomatic or symptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest 
      that univariate BOLD responses during typical fMRI tasks are not sensitive markers 
      of SMI risk and that further study, particularly longitudinal designs, will be 
      necessary to understand brain changes underlying the early stages of SMI.

TI  - Connectomic Underpinnings of Working Memory Deficits in Schizophrenia: Evidence From 
      a replication fMRI study.
PG  - 916-926
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbz137 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Working memory (WM) deficit is a key feature of schizophrenia that 
      relates to a generalized neural inefficiency of extensive brain areas. To date, it 
      remains unknown how these distributed regions are systemically organized at the 
      connectome level and how the disruption of such organization brings about the WM 
      impairment seen in schizophrenia. METHODS: We used graph theory to examine the 
      neural efficiency of the functional connectome in different granularity in 155 
      patients with schizophrenia and 96 healthy controls during a WM task. These analyses 
      were repeated in another independent dataset (81 patients and 54 controls). Linear 
      regression analysis was used to test associations of altered graph properties, 
      clinical symptoms, and WM accuracy in patients. A machine-learning approach was 
      adopted to study the ability of multivariate connectome features from one dataset to 
      discriminate patients from controls in the second dataset. RESULTS: Small-worldness 
      of the whole-brain connectome was significantly increased in schizophrenia during 
      the WM task; this increase is related to better (though subpar) WM accuracy in 
      patients with more severe negative symptom burden. There was a shift in the degree 
      distribution to a more homogeneous form in patients. The machine-learning approach 
      classified a new set of patients from controls with 84.3% true-positivity rate for 
      schizophrenia and 71.6% overall accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a putative 
      mechanistic link between connectome topology, hub redistribution, and impaired 
      n-back performance in schizophrenia. The task-dependent modulation of the connectome 
      relates to, but remains inefficient in, improving the performance above par in the 
      presence of severe negative symptoms.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evidence for working memory (WM) deficits in obsessive-compulsive 
      disorder (OCD) is increasing. However, findings regarding the underlying neural 
      substrates are heterogeneous. Moreover, the influence of cognitive demand on the 
      severity of these deficits and associated activation alterations is a matter of 
      debate. METHODS: To further address this question the present fMRI study examined a 
      sample of 21 predominantly medication-free inpatients with OCD and 21 matched 
      healthy volunteers using a parametric verbal n-back task. RESULTS: In agreement with 
      earlier studies patients exhibited focused activation alterations that could be 
      found to be critically dependent on WM demands: There were no differences in 
      activation between patients and healthy volunteers under low cognitive demands. 
      However, patients exhibited a significantly decreased activation in the dorsal 
      anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in association with increasing task demands. While 
      dACC activation in controls showed a linear increase with increasing task demands, 
      this linearity was not detectable in patients with OCD. CONCLUSIONS: Present 
      findings provide further support for the relevance of the anterior cingulate in OCD 
      and illustrate that both task demands and task processes are of major influence in 
      this context.

AB  - Dysfunctional social communication is one of the most stable characteristics in 
      patients with schizophrenia that also affects quality of life. Interpreting abstract 
      speech and integrating nonverbal modalities is particularly affected. Considering 
      the impact of communication on social life but failure to treat communication 
      dysfunctions with usual treatment, we will investigate the possibility to improve 
      verbal and non-verbal communication in schizophrenia by applying a multimodal 
      speech-gesture training (MSG training). Here we describe the newly developed MSG 
      training program and the study design for the first clinical investigation. The 
      intervention contains perceptive rating (match/mismatch of sentence and gesture) and 
      memory tasks (n-back tasks), imitation and productive tasks (e.g., SG 
      fluency-similar to verbal fluency where words are accompanied by gesture). In 
      addition, we offer information about gesture as meta-learning element as well as 
      homework for reasons of transfer to everyday life as part of every session. In the 
      MSG training intervention, we offer eight sessions (60 min each) of training. The 
      first pilot study is currently conducted as a single-center, randomized controlled 
      trial of speech-gesture intervention versus wait-list control with a follow-up. 
      Outcomes are measured through pre-post-fMRI and standardized psychological 
      questionnaires comparing two subject groups (30 patients with schizophrenia and 30 
      healthy controls). Patients and healthy controls are randomized in two intervention 
      groups (with 20 being in the wait-training group and 10 in the training-follow-up 
      group). With our study design we will be able to demonstrate the beneficial effect 
      of the MSG training intervention on behavioral and neural levels. CLINICAL TRIAL

TI  - Acute Exercise Effects Predict Training Change in Cognition and Connectivity.
PG  - 131-140
LID - 10.1249/MSS.0000000000002115 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Previous studies report memory and functional connectivity of memory 
      systems improve acutely after a single aerobic exercise session or with training, 
      suggesting that the acute effects of aerobic exercise may reflect initial changes 
      that adapt over time. In this trial, for the first time, we test the 
      proof-of-concept of whether the acute and training effects of aerobic exercise on 
      working memory and brain network connectivity are related in the same participants. 
      METHODS: Cognitively normal older participants (N = 34) were enrolled in a 
      randomized clinical trial (NCT02453178). Participants completed fMRI resting state 
      and a face working memory N-back task acutely after light- and moderate-intensity 
      exercises and after a 12-wk aerobic training intervention. RESULTS: Functional 
      connectivity did not change more after moderate-intensity training compared with 
      light-intensity training. However, both training groups showed similar changes in 
      cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) (maximal exercise oxygen uptake, V˙O2peak), limiting 
      group-level comparisons. Acute effects of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on 
      connections primarily in the default network predicted training enhancements in the 
      same connections. Working memory also improved acutely, especially after 
      moderate-intensity, and greater acute improvements predicted greater working memory 
      improvement with training. Exercise effects on functional connectivity of right 
      lateralized frontoparietal connections were related to both acute and training gains 
      in working memory. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the concept of acute aerobic 
      exercise effects on functional brain systems and performance as an activity-evoked 
      biomarker for exercise training benefits in the same outcomes. These findings may 
      lead to new insights and methods for improving memory outcomes with aerobic exercise 
      training.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often present with 
      executive functioning (EF) deficits, including spatial working memory (SWM) 
      impairment, which impedes real-world functioning. The present study examined 
      task-related brain activity, connectivity and individual variability in 
      fMRI-measured neural response during an SWM task in older youth and young adults 
      with autism and clinically significant EF impairment. METHODS: Neuroimaging was 
      analyzed in 29 individuals with ASD without intellectual disability who had 
      clinically significant EF impairment on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive 
      Function, and 20 typically developing controls (participant age range=16-34). An SWM 
      N-Back task was performed during fMRI. SWM activity (2-Back vs. 0-Back) and 
      task-related dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) connectivity was examined within 
      and between groups. Variability of neural response during SWM was also examined. 
      RESULTS: During SWM performance both groups activated the expected networks, and no 
      group differences in network activation or task-related DLPFC-connectivity were 
      found. However, greater individual variability in the pattern of SWM activity was 
      found in the ASD versus the typically developing control group. CONCLUSIONS: While 
      there were no group differences in SWM task-evoked activity or connectivity, 
      fronto-parietal network engagement was found to be more variable/idiosyncratic in 
      ASD. Our results suggest that the fronto-parietal network may be shifted or 
      sub-optimally engaged during SWM performance in participants with ASD with 
      clinically significant EF impairment, with implications for developing targeted 
      interventions for this subgroup.

AB  - Individual differences in striatal dopamine (DA) signaling have been associated both 
      with individual differences in executive function in healthy individuals and with 
      risk for psychiatric disorders defined by executive dysfunction. We used 
      resting-state functional connectivity in 50 healthy adults to examine whether a 
      polymorphism of the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1), which regulates striatal DA 
      function, affects striatal functional connectivity in healthy adults, and whether 
      that connectivity predicts executive function. We found that 9/10 heterozygotes, who 
      are believed to have higher striatal DA signaling, demonstrated stronger 
      connectivity between dorsal caudate (DC) and insular, dorsal anterior cingulate, and 
      dorsolateral prefrontal regions, as well as between ventral striatum and 
      ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, than 10/10 homozygotes. Across subjects, stronger 
      DC-seeded connectivity predicted superior N-back working memory performance, while 
      stronger ventral striatum-seeded connectivity predicted reduced impulsivity in 
      everyday life. Further, mediation analysis suggested that connectivity strength 
      mediated relationships between DAT1 genotype and behavior. These findings suggest 
      that resting-state striato-frontal connectivity may be an endophenotype for 
      executive function in healthy individuals.

TI  - Predicting multilingual effects on executive function and individual connectomes in 
      children: An ABCD study.
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2110811118 [doi]
LID - e2110811118
AB  - While there is a substantial amount of work studying multilingualism's effect on 
      cognitive functions, little is known about how the multilingual experience modulates 
      the brain as a whole. In this study, we analyzed data of over 1,000 children from 
      the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study to examine whether 
      monolinguals and multilinguals differ in executive function, functional brain 
      connectivity, and brain-behavior associations. We observed significantly better 
      performance from multilingual children than monolinguals in working-memory tasks. In 
      one finding, we were able to classify multilinguals from monolinguals using only 
      their whole-brain functional connectome at rest and during an emotional n-back task. 
      Compared to monolinguals, the multilingual group had different functional 
      connectivity mainly in the occipital lobe and subcortical areas during the emotional 
      n-back task and in the occipital lobe and prefrontal cortex at rest. In contrast, we 
      did not find any differences in behavioral performance and functional connectivity 
      when performing a stop-signal task. As a second finding, we investigated the degree 
      to which behavior is reflected in the brain by implementing a connectome-based 
      behavior prediction approach. The multilingual group showed a significant 
      correlation between observed and connectome-predicted individual working-memory 
      performance scores, while the monolingual group did not show any correlations. 
      Overall, our observations suggest that multilingualism enhances executive function 
      and reliably modulates the corresponding brain functional connectome, distinguishing 
      multilinguals from monolinguals even at the developmental stage.

AB  - The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val(158)Met polymorphism has been associated 
      with working memory (WM) in many studies, but the results have not been consistent. 
      One plausible explanation is sex-specific effects of this polymorphism as reported 
      in several studies. The current study aimed to explore the sex-specific effects of 
      the COMT Val(158)Met polymorphism on WM-related brain function in an elderly sample. 
      We found that Val homozygotes outperformed Met allele carriers on the backward digit 
      span subtest for both males and females. The triangular part of the left inferior 
      frontal gyrus and the left inferior temporal gyrus exhibited higher activation in 
      Met allele carriers compared with Val homozygotes during the n-back task, while the 
      background functional connectivity (bFC) between the left angular gyrus (ANG) and 
      the right ANG was enhanced in Val homozygotes as compared to Met allele carriers. 
      Finally, the associations between brain activation, bFC (among various regions), and 
      WM performance were identified only in specific genotype groups of the female 
      participants. These findings provide new insights into the role of COMT Val(158)Met 
      gene polymorphism in brain function, particularly its female-specific nature.

      Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Working memory dysfunction is common in Parkinson's disease, even in its early 
      stages, but its neural basis is debated. Working memory performance likely reflects 
      a balance between corticostriatal dysfunction and compensatory mechanisms. We tested 
      this hypothesis by examining working memory performance with a letter n-back task in 
      19 patients with mild-moderate Parkinson's disease and 20 demographically matched 
      healthy controls. Parkinson's disease patients were tested after an overnight 
      washout of their usual dopamine replacement therapy, and again after a standard dose 
      of levodopa. FMRI was used to assess task-related activation and resting state 
      functional connectivity; changes in BOLD signal were related to performance to 
      disentangle pathological and compensatory processes. Parkinson's disease patients 
      off dopamine replacement therapy displayed significantly reduced spatial extent of 
      task-related activation in left prefrontal and bilateral parietal cortex, and poorer 
      working memory performance, compared to controls. Amongst the Parkinson's disease 
      patients off dopamine replacement therapy, relatively better performance was 
      associated with greater activation of right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared 
      to controls, consistent with compensatory right hemisphere recruitment. 
      Administration of levodopa remediated the working memory deficit in the Parkinson's 
      disease group, and resulted in a different pattern of performance-correlated 
      activity, with a shift to greater left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activation in 
      patients on, compared to off dopamine replacement therapy. Levodopa also 
      significantly increased resting-state functional connectivity between caudate and 
      right parietal cortex (within the right fronto-parietal attentional network). The 
      strength of this connectivity contributed to better performance in patients and 
      controls, suggesting a general compensatory mechanism. These findings argue that 
      Parkinson's disease patients can recruit additional neural resources, here, the 
      right fronto-parietal network, to optimize working memory performance despite 
      impaired corticostriatal function. Levodopa seems to both boost engagement of a 
      task-specific prefrontal region, and strengthen a putative compensatory 
      caudate-cortical network to support this executive function.

AB  - Adolescence is characterized by rapid development of executive function. Working 
      memory (WM) is a key element of executive function, but it is not known what brain 
      changes during adolescence allow improved WM performance. Using a fractal n-back 
      fMRI paradigm, we investigated brain responses to WM load in 951 human youths aged 
      8-22 years. Compared with more limited associations with age, WM performance was 
      robustly associated with both executive network activation and deactivation of the 
      default mode network. Multivariate patterns of brain activation predicted task 
      performance with a high degree of accuracy, and also mediated the observed 
      age-related improvements in WM performance. These results delineate a process of 
      functional maturation of the executive system, and suggest that this process allows 
      for the improvement of cognitive capability seen during adolescence.

AB  - The psychosis high-risk state is accompanied by alterations in functional brain 
      activity during working memory processing. We used binary automatic 
      pattern-classification to discriminate between the at-risk mental state (ARMS), 
      first episode psychosis (FEP) and healthy controls (HCs) based on n-back WM-induced 
      brain activity. Linear support vector machines and leave-one-out-cross-validation 
      were applied to fMRI data of matched ARMS, FEP and HC (19 subjects/group). The HC 
      and ARMS were correctly classified, with an accuracy of 76.2% (sensitivity 89.5%, 
      specificity 63.2%, p = 0.01) using a verbal working memory network mask. Only 50% 
      and 47.4% of individuals were classified correctly for HC vs. FEP (p = 0.46) or ARMS 
      vs. FEP (p = 0.62), respectively. Without mask, accuracy was 65.8% for HC vs. ARMS 
      (p = 0.03) and 65.8% for HC vs. FEP (p = 0.0047), and 57.9% for ARMS vs. FEP (p = 
      0.18). Regions in the medial frontal, paracingulate, cingulate, inferior frontal and 
      superior frontal gyri, inferior and superior parietal lobules, and precuneus were 
      particularly important for group separation. These results suggest that FEP and HC 
      or FEP and ARMS cannot be accurately separated in small samples under these 
      conditions. However, ARMS can be identified with very high sensitivity in comparison 
      to HC. This might aid classification and help to predict transition in the ARMS.

AB  - Structural and metabolic abnormalities in fronto-striatal structures have been 
      reported in children with prenatal methamphetamine (MA) exposure. The current study 
      was designed to quantify functional alterations to the fronto-striatal circuit in 
      children with prenatal MA exposure using functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI). Because many women who use MA during pregnancy also use alcohol, a known 
      teratogen, we examined 50 children (age range 7-15), 19 with prenatal MA exposure, 
      15 of whom had concomitant prenatal alcohol exposure (the MAA group), 13 with heavy 
      prenatal alcohol but no MA exposure (ALC group), and 18 unexposed controls (CON 
      group). We hypothesized that MA exposed children would demonstrate abnormal brain 
      activation during a visuospatial working memory (WM) "N-Back" task. As predicted, 
      the MAA group showed less activation than the CON group in many brain areas, 
      including the striatum and frontal lobe in the left hemisphere. The ALC group showed 
      less activation than the MAA group in several regions, including the right striatum. 
      We found an inverse correlation between performance and activity in the striatum in 
      both the CON and MAA groups. However, this relationship was significant in the 
      caudate of the CON group but not the MAA group, and in the putamen of the MAA group 
      but not the CON group. These findings suggest that structural damage in the 
      fronto-striatal circuit after prenatal MA exposure leads to decreased recruitment of 
      this circuit during a WM challenge, and raise the possibility that a rewiring of 
      cortico-striatal networks may occur in children with prenatal MA exposure.

AB  - Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), or concussion, accounts for 85% of all TBIs. Yet 
      survivors anticipate full cognitive recovery within several months of injury, if not 
      sooner, dependent upon the specific outcome/measure. Recovery is variable and 
      deficits in executive function, e.g., working memory (WM) can persist years 
      post-mTBI. We tested whether cognitive deficits persist in otherwise healthy 
      undergraduates, as a conservative indicator for mTBI survivors at large. We 
      collected WM performance (change detection, n-back tasks) using various stimuli 
      (shapes, locations, letters; aurally presented numbers and letters), and 
      wide-ranging cognitive assessments (e.g., RBANS). We replicated the observation of a 
      general visual WM deficit, with preserved auditory WM. Surprisingly, visual WM 
      deficits were equivalent in participants with a history of mTBI (mean 4.3 years 
      post-injury) and in undergraduates with recent sports-related mTBI (mean 17 days 
      post-injury). In seeking the underlying mechanism of these behavioral deficits, we 
      collected resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) and EEG (rsEEG). RsfMRI revealed significantly 
      reduced connectivity within WM-relevant networks (default mode, central executive, 
      dorsal attention, salience), whereas rsEEG identified no differences (modularity, 
      global efficiency, local efficiency). In summary, otherwise healthy current 
      undergraduates with a history of mTBI present behavioral deficits with evidence of 
      persistent disconnection long after full recovery is expected.

TI  - Bipolar depressed patients show both failure to activate and failure to de-activate

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bipolar depression has been found to be associated with changes in 
      prefrontal cortex activity during performance of cognitive tasks. However, the role 
      of task-related de-activations has been little investigated. METHOD: Forty-one 
      bipolar depressed patients and 41 matched normal controls underwent fMRI scanning 
      while performing baseline, 1-back and 2-back versions of the n-back task. Linear 
      models were used to obtain maps of within-group activations and areas of 
      differential activation between the groups. RESULTS: The bipolar depressed patients 
      showed reduced activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) bilaterally 
      and several other regions. After controlling for differences in task performance 
      only differences in the DLPFC and cerebellum remained. Left DLPFC activation was 
      inversely correlated with Hamilton and MADRS scores. The patients showed failure to 
      de-activate in the medial prefrontal cortex, an area corresponding to the anterior 
      medial node of the default mode network. LIMITATIONS: To confirm default mode 
      network dysfunction demonstration of resting-state connectivity abnormalities would 
      also be required. The study was carried out on treated patients, and did not assess 
      for presence of depressive symptoms in the healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Both 
      prefrontal cortical and default mode network dysfunction appear to characterise 
      bipolar depression. The former, but not the latter, is associated with symptom 
      severity.

TI  - A proof-of-concept, randomized controlled trial of DAR-0100A, a dopamine-1 receptor 
      agonist, for cognitive enhancement in schizophrenia.
PG  - 428-35
LID - 10.1177/0269881116636120 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence from preclinical and human studies indicates the presence of 
      reduced dopamine-1 receptor (D1R) signaling in the cortex, where D1Rs predominate, 
      in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ), which may contribute to their cognitive 
      deficits. Furthermore, studies in nonhuman primates (NHP) have suggested that 
      intermittent administration of low doses of D1R agonists produce long-lasting 
      reversals in cognitive deficits. The purpose of this trial was to test whether a 
      similar design, involving subacute intermittent administration of low doses of a 
      full, selective agonist at D1Rs, DAR-0100A, would improve cognitive deficits in SCZ. 
      METHODS: We randomized 49 clinically stable individuals with SCZ to three weeks of 
      intermittent treatment with 0.5 mg or 15 mg of DAR-0100A, or placebo (normal 
      saline). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) BOLD was used to evaluate the 
      effects of drug administration on brain activity during a working memory (WM) task. 
      Effects on cognition were also assessed using the MATRICS and the N-back task as 
      primary endpoints. The CogState battery was used as a secondary endpoint. RESULTS: 
      There were no observed treatment effects on either the BOLD fMRI signal during WM 
      tasks or the WM domains of the MATRICS. Moderate improvement was detected on the 
      CogState battery and on the attention domain of the MATRICS. CONCLUSION: These 
      results suggest that low doses of D1 agonists that do not result in measureable 
      occupancy of the D1R do not reliably improve cognition in SCZ, unlike the 
      observations in NHP. As this drug is limited by its pharmacokinetic profile, better 
      D1R agonists that can achieve adequate levels of D1R occupancy are needed to test 
      the efficacy of this mechanism for cognitive enhancement in SCZ.

TI  - Altered brain function directly related to structural abnormalities in people at 
      ultra high risk of psychosis: longitudinal VBM-fMRI study.
PG  - 190-8
LID - 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2010.05.012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have indicated that people with prodromal signs of 
      psychosis show alterations in the structure and function of the brain when they 
      first present to clinical services. However, the longitudinal course of these 
      abnormalities, and how they relate to subsequent clinical and functional outcome is 
      relatively unclear. METHODS: A cohort of subjects at ultra high risk of psychosis 
      were studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in conjunction with 
      the N-Back task, and volumetric MRI at first clinical presentation and again after 
      one year. Levels of psychopathology and global functioning were assessed at the same 
      time points using the CAARMS, PANSS, and the GAF scale. RESULTS: At baseline, the 
      high risk group showed reduced activation during the task in the left middle frontal 
      gyrus, supramarginal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule, and reduced gray matter 
      volume in the left middle and medial frontal gyri, left insula and the right 
      anterior cingulate gyrus. Within the high-risk group, there was a positive 
      correlation between the magnitude of the functional and structural alterations in 
      the left middle frontal gyrus. Between presentation and follow up, the severity of 
      perceptual disorder and thought disorder (rated by the CAARMS), and of general 
      psychopathology (rated by the PANSS general score) decreased, and the level of 
      global functioning improved. This clinical and functional improvement was associated 
      with a longitudinal increase in activation in the anterior cingulate and right 
      parahippocampal gyrus. The change in anterior cingulate response was directly 
      correlated with the improvement in the GAF score. CONCLUSIONS: In subjects 
      presenting with prodromal signs of psychosis, reduced prefrontal activation during a 
      working memory task is associated with a reduction in gray matter volume in the same 
      area. Changes in anterior cingulate activation were correlated with functional 
      improvement in this group, consistent with the role of this region in multiple 
      cognitive and social processes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Neurofunctional alterations are correlates of vulnerability to 
      psychosis, as well as of the disorder itself. How these abnormalities relate to 
      different probabilities for later transition to psychosis is unclear. We 
      investigated vulnerability- versus disease-related versus resilience biomarkers of 
      psychosis during working memory (WM) processing in individuals with an at-risk 
      mental state (ARMS). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with "first-episode psychosis" 
      (FEP, n = 21), short-term ARMS (ARMS-ST, n = 17), long-term ARMS (ARMS-LT, n = 16), 
      and healthy controls (HC, n = 20) were investigated with an n-back WM task. We 
      examined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and structural magnetic 
      resonance imaging (sMRI) data in conjunction using biological parametric mapping 
      (BPM) toolbox. PRINCIPAL OBSERVATIONS: There were no differences in accuracy, but 
      the FEP and the ARMS-ST group had longer reaction times compared with the HC and the 
      ARMS-LT group. With the 2-back > 0-back contrast, we found reduced functional 
      activation in ARMS-ST and FEP compared with the HC group in parietal and middle 
      frontal regions. Relative to ARMS-LT individuals, FEP patients showed decreased 
      activation in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and insula, and in the left 
      prefrontal cortex. Compared with the ARMS-LT, the ARMS-ST subjects showed reduced 
      activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus and insula. Reduced insular and 
      prefrontal activation was associated with gray matter volume reduction in the same 
      area in the ARMS-LT group. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that vulnerability to 
      psychosis was associated with neurofunctional alterations in fronto-temporo-parietal 
      networks in a WM task. Neurofunctional differences within the ARMS were related to 
      different duration of the prodromal state and resilience factors.

TI  - Reduced prefrontal activation during working and long-term memory tasks and impaired 
      patient-reported cognition among cancer survivors postchemotherapy compared with 
      healthy controls.
PG  - 258-68
LID - 10.1002/cncr.29737 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy have reported cognitive 
      impairments that may last for years after the completion of treatment. Working 
      memory-related and long-term memory-related changes in this population are not well 
      understood. The objective of this study was to demonstrate that cancer-related 
      cognitive impairments are associated with the under recruitment of brain regions 
      involved in working and recognition memory compared with controls. METHODS: Oncology 
      patients (n = 15) who were receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and had evidence of 
      cognitive impairment according to neuropsychological testing and self-report and a 
      group of age-matched, education group-matched, cognitively normal control 
      participants (n = 14) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging. During 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants performed a nonverbal n-back 
      working memory task and a visual recognition task. RESULTS: On the working memory 
      task, when 1-back and 2-back data were averaged and contrasted with 0-back data, 
      significantly reduced activation was observed in the right dorsolateral prefrontal 
      cortex for oncology patients versus controls. On the recognition task, oncology 
      patients displayed decreased activity of the left-middle hippocampus compared with 
      controls. Neuroimaging results were not associated with patient-reported cognition. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Decreased recruitment of brain regions associated with the encoding of 
      working memory and recognition memory was observed in the oncology patients compared 
      with the control group. These results suggest that there is a reduction in neural 
      functioning postchemotherapy and corroborate patient-reported cognitive difficulties 
      after cancer treatment, although a direct association was not observed. Cancer

      impairment.
PG  - 101-12
LID - 10.3233/JAD-132360 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies showed that acute caffeine administration enhances task-related 
      brain activation in elderly individuals with preserved cognition. To explore the 
      effects of this widely used agent on cognition and brain activation in early phases 
      of cognitive decline, we performed a double-blinded, placebo-controlled functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study during an n-back working memory task in 17 
      individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared to 17 age-matched healthy 
      controls (HC). All individuals were regular caffeine consumers with an overnight 
      abstinence and given 200 mg caffeine versus placebo tablets 30 minutes before 
      testing. Analyses included assessment of task-related activation (general linear 
      model), functional connectivity (tensorial-independent component analysis, TICA), 
      baseline perfusion (arterial spin labeling, ASL), grey matter density (voxel-based 
      morphometry, VBM), and white matter microstructure (tract-based spatial statistics, 
      TBSS). Acute caffeine administration induced a focal activation of the prefrontal 
      areas in HC with a more diffuse and posteromedial activation pattern in MCI 
      individuals. In MCI, TICA documented a significant caffeine-related enhancement in 
      the prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area, ventral premotor and parietal 
      cortex as well as the basal ganglia and cerebellum. The absence of significant group 
      differences in baseline ASL perfusion patterns supports a neuronal rather than a 
      purely vascular origin of these differences. The VBM and TBSS analyses excluded 
      potentially confounding differences in grey matter density and white matter 
      microstructure between MCI and HC. The present findings suggest a posterior 
      displacement of working memory-related brain activation patterns after caffeine 
      administration in MCI that may represent a compensatory mechanism to counterbalance 
      a frontal lobe dysfunction.

TI  - Failure of de-activation in the medial frontal cortex in mania: evidence for default 
      mode network dysfunction in the disorder.
PG  - 616-26
LID - 10.3109/15622975.2011.573808 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Manic patients have been found to show reduced activation in the 
      prefrontal cortex and other regions during performance of cognitive tasks. However, 
      little is known about de-activations associated with the disorder. This study aimed 
      to examine, at the whole-brain level, abnormal patterns of task-related activation 
      and de-activation during performance of a working memory task. METHODS: Twenty-nine 
      DSM-IV bipolar patients and 46 healthy controls underwent fMRI during performance of 
      the n-back task. The patients were scanned while they were in a manic episode. 
      Linear models were used to obtain maps of within-group activations and areas of 
      differential activation between the groups. RESULTS: The manic patients showed 
      reduced activation compared to the controls in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal 
      cortex and the right parietal cortex. They also showed failure of de-activation in 
      the medial frontal cortex, extending to the temporal poles and parts of the limbic 
      system bilaterally. The failure of activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
      disappeared when differences in task performance were controlled for in the 
      analysis. However, the medial frontal failure of de-activation survived controlling 
      for this. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that, in addition to reduced prefrontal 
      activation, failure of de-activation is an important functional imaging abnormality 
      in mania. This, together with its location in the medial prefrontal cortex, implies 
      default mode network dysfunction in the disorder.

TI  - Differential effects of erythropoietin on neural and cognitive measures of executive 
      function 3 and 7 days post-administration.
PG  - 313-21
AB  - Erythropoietin (Epo) has neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects and improves 
      cognitive function in animal models of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric 
      illness. In humans, weekly Epo administration over 3 months improves cognitive 
      function in schizophrenia. The neural underpinnings and time-course of this effect 
      of Epo are currently unknown. It is also unclear whether the cognitive improvement 
      reflects direct neurobiological actions or is secondary to hematological effects. We 
      therefore assessed the actions of single administration of Epo (40,000 IU) vs. 
      saline to healthy volunteers on cognitive and neural measures of executive function 
      using a verbal fluency task and N-back working memory (WM) paradigm during 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on day 3 and 7 after administration in 
      two separate cohorts of subjects. Epo modulated neuronal response in a 
      fronto-parietal network during WM performance at both time points; on day 3 after 
      administration, activation was increased in left-hemisphere frontal and cingulate 
      cortex and reduced in the right parietal cortex; in contrast, neural response was 
      enhanced in a right-lateralized fronto-parietal network and reduced in left-side 
      regions 1 week post-administration. In addition, Epo-treated volunteers displayed 
      improved verbal fluency performance 1 week post-administration. These effects 
      occurred in the absence of changes in hematological measures suggesting that they 
      reflect direct neurobiological actions of Epo. The findings are consistent with 
      enduring effects of Epo on neurotrophic signaling and induction of neurochemical 
      changes over time in neural networks typically affected in neuropsychiatric illness. 
      The present study supports the notion that Epo may have clinical applications in the 
      treatment of psychiatric disorder characterized by cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - Previous working memory (WM) studies found that relative to controls, subjects with 
      cannabis use disorder (CUD) showed greater brain activation in some regions (e.g., 
      left [L] and right [R] ventrolateral prefrontal cortex [VLPFC], and L dorsolateral 
      prefrontal cortex [L-DLPFC]), and lower activation in other regions (e.g., R-DLPFC). 
      In this study, effective connectivity (EC) analysis was applied to functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging data acquired from 23 CUD subjects and 23 controls (two 
      groups matched for sociodemographic factors and substance use history) while 
      performing an n-back WM task with interleaved 2-back and 0-back periods. A 2-back 
      minus 0-back modulator was defined to measure the modulatory changes of EC 
      corresponding to the 2-back relative to 0-back conditions. Compared to the controls, 
      the CUD group showed smaller modulatory change in the R-DLPFC to L-caudate pathway, 
      and greater modulatory changes in L-DLPFC to L-caudate, R-DLPFC to R-caudate, and 
      R-VLPFC to L-caudate pathways. Based on previous fMRI studies consistently 
      suggesting that greater brain activations are related to a compensatory mechanism 
      for cannabis neural effects (less regional brain activations), the smaller 
      modulatory change in the R-DLPFC to L-caudate EC may be compensated by the larger 
      modulatory changes in the other prefrontal-striatal ECs in the CUD individuals.

TI  - Neuroimaging Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Task-Based Dorsolateral 
      Prefrontal Cortex Activation Following 12 Weeks of Cosmos caudatus Supplementation 
      Among Older Adults With Mild Cognitive Impairment.
PG  - 1804-1818
LID - 10.1002/jmri.27762 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cosmos caudatus (CC) is traditional Asian vegetable, commonly consumed 
      among the Southeast Asian population. It has been reported to be high in flavonoids 
      and might potentially improve brain activity among older adults with mild cognitive 
      impairment (MCI). The effect of CC in brain activation improvement using 
      neuroimaging is yet to be discovered. PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of CC 
      supplement on brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
      among older adults with MCI. STUDY TYPE: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled trial. POPULATION/SUBJECTS: Twenty older adults with mild 
      cognitive impairment (60-75 years old), 14 of them (70%) were female subjects. FIELD 
      STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: A 3.0-T, T1-weighted anatomical images, T2*-weighted imaging 
      data, A single shot, gradient echo-echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence. ASSESSMENT: 
      All subjects were asked to consume two 500 mg capsules of either CC supplement or 
      placebo (maltodextrin) daily for 12 weeks. Cognitive function was measured using 
      validated neuropsychological tests (i.e. Mini-mental State Examination and Digit 
      Span) and task-based fMRI (N-back and Stroop Color Word Test) at baseline and 12th 
      week. Brodmann's area 9, 46 and anterior cingulate cortex were selected as the 
      regions of interest to define dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in fMRI 
      analysis. STATISTICAL TESTS: Normality test was performed with the Shapiro-Wilk 
      test. Two-way repeated ANOVA determined the intervention effects of the CC 
      supplementation on brain activity after adjustments for covariates. Significance 
      level at P < 0.05 for independent-t test and Chi square test; adjusted P < 0.0042 
      for two-way repeated ANOVA after Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: Findings showed 
      significant improvements in digit span (partial η(2)  = 0.559), increment in right 
      DLPFC activation while performing 1-back task (partial η(2)  = 0.586) and left DLPFC 
      activation while performing Stroop Color Word Test (SCWT) (congruent) task (partial 
      η(2)  = 0.432) at 12th week of CC supplementation. CONCLUSION: CC supplementation 
      might have the ability to improve DLPFC activation, potentially leading to improved 
      working memory among older adults with MCI after 12 weeks of administration. LEVEL 
      OF EVIDENCE: 1 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 4.

TI  - Regional Brain Correlates of Beta Bursts in Health and Psychosis: A Concurrent 
      Electroencephalography and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is emerging evidence for abnormal beta oscillations in psychosis. 
      Beta oscillations are likely to play a key role in the coordination of sensorimotor 
      information that is crucial to healthy mental function. Growing evidence suggests 
      that beta oscillations typically manifest as transient beta bursts that increase in 
      probability following a motor response, observable as post-movement beta rebound. 
      Evidence indicates that post-movement beta rebound is attenuated in psychosis, with 
      greater attenuation associated with greater symptom severity and impairment. 
      Delineating the functional role of beta bursts therefore may be key to understanding 
      the mechanisms underlying persistent psychotic illness. METHODS: We used concurrent 
      electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify blood 
      oxygen level-dependent correlates of beta bursts during the n-back working memory 
      task and intervening rest periods in healthy control participants (n = 30) and 
      patients with psychosis (n = 48). RESULTS: During both task blocks and intervening 
      rest periods, beta bursts phasically activated regions implicated in task-relevant 
      content while suppressing currently tonically active regions. Patients showed 
      attenuated post-movement beta rebound that was associated with persisting 
      disorganization symptoms as well as impairments in cognition and role function. 
      Patients also showed greater task-related reductions in overall beta burst rate and 
      showed greater, more extensive, beta burst-related blood oxygen level-dependent 
      activation. CONCLUSIONS: Our evidence supports a model in which beta bursts 
      reactivate latently maintained sensorimotor information and are dysregulated and 
      inefficient in psychosis. We propose that abnormalities in the mechanisms by which 
      beta bursts coordinate reactivation of contextually appropriate content can manifest 
      as disorganization, working memory deficits, and inaccurate forward models and may 
      underlie a core deficit associated with persisting symptoms and impairment.

TI  - A single 20 mg dose of dihydrexidine (DAR-0100), a full dopamine D1 agonist, is safe 
      and tolerated in patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 42-50
AB  - The potential of dopamine D(1) receptor agonists to have beneficial effects on 
      cognitive function has been suggested by a body of preclinical evidence. We now 
      report the use of dihydrexidine (DAR-0100), the first full D(1) agonist, in a pilot 
      study assessing single low dose safety and tolerability in patients with 
      schizophrenia. A within-subject cross-over design was used in 20 adults (18-65 
      years) with SCID-IV diagnosed schizophrenia. Subjects were outpatients with a 
      moderate level of residual negative symptoms, and were on stable dosing of 
      non-D(1)-blocking antipsychotic drugs. Following screening, subjects were 
      hospitalized for 48 h, and at 0800 h each morning scanned on a 3 T MRI scanner for 
      resting brain perfusion, followed by a Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI scan 
      during an N-Back working memory task. They then received 20 mg subcutaneously (SC) 
      of dihydrexidine or placebo over 15 min, followed by 45 min of intermittent MRI 
      scans of perfusion and BOLD activity during the working memory task. Blood was drawn 
      for serum drug levels and subjects were evaluated for clinical and cognitive 
      changes. The procedure was repeated using the opposite challenge 2 days later. 
      Dihydrexidine was well tolerated with no serious adverse events although three 
      subjects had mild dizziness and five subjects experienced nausea. There was no 
      significant effect of drug on clinical interview ratings or delayed (afternoon) 
      neuropsychological performance. No medication interactions were seen. Thus, a single 
      subcutaneous dose of dihydrexidine is tolerated and safe in patients with 
      schizophrenia and does not produce delayed clinical or neuropsychological 
      improvements.

TI  - Neural correlates of working memory training in HIV patients: study protocol for a 
      randomized controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Potent combined antiretroviral therapy decreased the incidence and 
      severity of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND); however, no specific 
      effective pharmacotherapy exists for HAND. Patients with HIV commonly have deficits 
      in working memory and attention, which may negatively impact many other cognitive 
      domains, leading to HAND. Since HAND may lead to loss of independence in activities 
      of daily living and negative emotional well-being, and incur a high economic burden, 
      effective treatments for HAND are urgently needed. This study aims to determine 
      whether adaptive working memory training might improve cognitive functions and 
      neural network efficiency and possibly decrease neuroinflammation. This study also 
      aims to assess whether subjects with the LMX1A-rs4657412 TT(AA) genotype show 
      greater training effects from working memory training than TC(AG) or 
      CC(GG)-carriers. METHODS/DESIGN: 60 HIV-infected and 60 seronegative control 
      participants will be randomized to a double-blind active-controlled study, using 
      adaptive versus non-adaptive Cogmed Working Memory Training® (CWMT), 20-25 sessions 
      over 5-8 weeks. Each subject will be assessed with near- and far-transfer cognitive 
      tasks, self-reported mood and executive function questionnaires, and 
      blood-oxygenation level-dependent functional MRI during working memory (n-back) and 
      visual attention (ball tracking) tasks, at baseline, 1-month, and 6-months after 
      CWMT. Furthermore, genotyping for LMX1A-rs4657412 will be performed to identify 
      whether subjects with the TT(AA)-genotype show greater gain or neural efficiency 
      after CWMT than those with other genotypes. Lastly, cerebrospinal fluid will be 
      obtained before and after CWMT to explore changes in levels of inflammatory proteins 
      (cytokines and chemokines) and monoamines. DISCUSSION: Improving working memory in 
      HIV patients, using CWMT, might slow the progression or delay the onset of HAND. 
      Observation of decreased brain activation or normalized neural networks, using fMRI, 
      after CWMT would lead to a better understanding of how neural networks are modulated 
      by CWMT. Moreover, validating the greater training gain in subjects with the 
      LMX1A-TT(AA) genotype could lead to a personalized approach for future working 
      memory training studies. Demonstrating and understanding the neural correlates of 
      the efficacy of CWMT in HIV patients could lead to a safe adjunctive therapy for 
      HAND, and possibly other brain disorders. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrial.gov,

TI  - Responders to ChEI treatment of Alzheimer's disease show restitution of normal 
      regional cortical activation.
PG  - 97-111
AB  - Clinical trials of cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) drugs, although generally 
      reporting only minimal improvements in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
      indicate that a subgroup of patients may respond substantially to treatment. This 
      study aimed to assess the clinically variable ChEI treatment effects in a group of 
      patients with mild AD using a semantic association and an N-back light working 
      memory activation paradigm. Twenty-six patients with probable mild AD treated with a 
      ChEI for 20 weeks were retrospectively divided into responders and non-responders. 
      Patients were classified as responders if their Clinician's Interview Based 
      Impression of Change (CIBIC - Plus) score was four or less and if they had an 
      increase of at least two points on the MMSE. These criteria resulted in two 
      subgroups comprising nine responders and seventeen non responders. Nine healthy 
      elderly age-matched controls were also recruited as a comparison group. ChEI 
      treatment was accompanied by significant modulation of task induced activation 
      increases in both fMRI tasks in AD responders. The effect of ChEI response was in 
      effect a restoration of regional brain function in the same areas used by elderly 
      controls when performing these tasks. In non-responders decrements in task related 
      activation were observed and over time activation patterns appeared less like the 
      elderly controls. Screening semantic fluency scores correlated negatively with 
      activation increases at retest. In the paper, a tentative explanation is offered of 
      why subgroups of patients with a similar clinical diagnosis and level of clinical 
      severity show a different physiological response to ChE inhibition.

TI  - Risperidone and divalproex differentially engage the fronto-striato-temporal

      imaging study.
PG  - 157-170.e5

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The current study examined the impact of risperidone and divalproex on 
      affective and working memory circuitry in patients with pediatric bipolar disorder 
      (PBD). METHOD: This was a six-week, double-blind, randomized trial of risperidone 
      plus placebo versus divalproex plus placebo for patients with mania (n = 21; 13.6 ± 
      2.5 years of age). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) outcomes were 
      measured using a block design, affective, N-back task with angry, happy, and neutral 
      face stimuli at baseline and at 6-week follow-up. Matched healthy controls (HC; n = 
      15, 14.5 ± 2.8 years) were also scanned twice. RESULTS: In post hoc analyses on the 
      significant interaction in a 3×2×2 analysis of variance (ANOVA) that included 
      patient groups and HC, the risperidone group showed greater activation after 
      treatment in response to the angry face condition in the left subgenual anterior 
      cingulate cortex (ACC) and striatum relative to the divalproex group. The divalproex 
      group showed greater activation relative to the risperidone group in the left 
      inferior frontal gyrus and right middle temporal gyrus. Over the treatment course, 
      the risperidone group showed greater change in activation in the left ventral 
      striatum than the divalproex group, and the divalproex group showed greater 
      activation change in left inferior frontal gyrus and right middle temporal gyrus 
      than the risperidone group. Furthermore, each patient group showed increased 
      activation relative to HC in fronto-striato-temporal regions over time. The happy 
      face condition was potentially less emotionally challenging in this study and did 
      not elicit notable findings. CONCLUSIONS: When patients performed a working memory 
      task under emotional duress inherent in the paradigm, divalproex enhanced activation 
      in a fronto-temporal circuit whereas risperidone increased activation in the 
      dopamine (D₂) receptor-rich ventral striatum. Clinical trial registration

TI  - Evidence for default mode network dysfunction in borderline personality disorder.
PG  - 1746-1754
LID - 10.1017/S0033291719001880 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although executive and other cognitive deficits have been found in 
      patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD), whether these have brain 
      functional correlates has been little studied. This study aimed to examine patterns 
      of task-related activation and de-activation during the performance of a working 
      memory task in patients with the disorder. METHODS: Sixty-seven DSM-IV BPD patients 
      and 67 healthy controls underwent fMRI during the performance of the n-back task. 
      Linear models were used to obtain maps of within-group activations and areas of 
      differential activation between the groups. RESULTS: On corrected whole-brain 
      analysis, there were no activation differences between the BPD patients and the 
      healthy controls during the main 2-back v. baseline contrast, but reduced activation 
      was seen in the precentral cortex bilaterally and the left inferior parietal cortex 
      in the 2-back v. 1-back contrast. The patients showed failure of de-activation 
      affecting the medial frontal cortex and the precuneus, plus in other areas. The 
      changes did not appear to be attributable to previous history of depression, which 
      was present in nearly half the sample. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, there was some, 
      though limited, evidence for lateral frontal hypoactivation in BPD during the 
      performance of an executive task. BPD also appears to be associated with failure of 
      de-activation in key regions of the default mode network.

AB  - This proof-of-concept study examines the feasibility of defining subgroups in 
      psychiatric spectrum disorders by generative embedding, using dynamical system 
      models which infer neuronal circuit mechanisms from neuroimaging data. To this end, 
      we re-analysed an fMRI dataset of 41 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 42 
      healthy controls performing a numerical n-back working-memory task. In our 
      generative-embedding approach, we used parameter estimates from a dynamic causal 
      model (DCM) of a visual-parietal-prefrontal network to define a model-based feature 
      space for the subsequent application of supervised and unsupervised learning 
      techniques. First, using a linear support vector machine for classification, we were 
      able to predict individual diagnostic labels significantly more accurately (78%) 
      from DCM-based effective connectivity estimates than from functional connectivity 
      between (62%) or local activity within the same regions (55%). Second, an 
      unsupervised approach based on variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture modelling 
      provided evidence for two clusters which mapped onto patients and controls with 
      nearly the same accuracy (71%) as the supervised approach. Finally, when restricting 
      the analysis only to the patients, Gaussian mixture modelling suggested the 
      existence of three patient subgroups, each of which was characterised by a different 
      architecture of the visual-parietal-prefrontal working-memory network. Critically, 
      even though this analysis did not have access to information about the patients' 
      clinical symptoms, the three neurophysiologically defined subgroups mapped onto 
      three clinically distinct subgroups, distinguished by significant differences in 
      negative symptom severity, as assessed on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale 
      (PANSS). In summary, this study provides a concrete example of how psychiatric 
      spectrum diseases may be split into subgroups that are defined in terms of 
      neurophysiological mechanisms specified by a generative model of network dynamics 
      such as DCM. The results corroborate our previous findings in stroke patients that 
      generative embedding, compared to analyses of more conventional measures such as 
      functional connectivity or regional activity, can significantly enhance both the 
      interpretability and performance of computational approaches to clinical 
      classification.

AB  - Functional connectivity has been shown to be a very promising tool for studying the 
      large-scale functional architecture of the human brain. In network research in fMRI, 
      functional connectivity is considered as a set of pair-wise interactions between the 
      nodes of the network. These interactions are typically operationalized through the 
      full or partial correlation between all pairs of regional time series. Estimating 
      the structure of the latent underlying functional connectome from the set of 
      pair-wise partial correlations remains an open research problem though. Typically, 
      this thresholding problem is approached by proportional thresholding, or by means of 
      parametric or non-parametric permutation testing across a cohort of subjects at each 
      possible connection. As an alternative, we propose a data-driven thresholding 
      approach for network matrices on the basis of mixture modeling. This approach allows 
      for creating subject-specific sparse connectomes by modeling the full set of partial 
      correlations as a mixture of low correlation values associated with weak or 
      unreliable edges in the connectome and a sparse set of reliable connections. 
      Consequently, we propose to use alternative thresholding strategy based on the model 
      fit using pseudo-False Discovery Rates derived on the basis of the empirical null 
      estimated as part of the mixture distribution. We evaluate the method on synthetic 
      benchmark fMRI datasets where the underlying network structure is known, and 
      demonstrate that it gives improved performance with respect to the alternative 
      methods for thresholding connectomes, given the canonical thresholding levels. We 
      also demonstrate that mixture modeling gives highly reproducible results when 
      applied to the functional connectomes of the visual system derived from the n-back 
      Working Memory task in the Human Connectome Project. The sparse connectomes obtained 
      from mixture modeling are further discussed in the light of the previous knowledge 
      of the functional architecture of the visual system in humans. We also demonstrate 
      that with use of our method, we are able to extract similar information on the group 
      level as can be achieved with permutation testing even though these two methods are 
      not equivalent. We demonstrate that with both of these methods, we obtain functional 
      decoupling between the two hemispheres in the higher order areas of the visual 
      cortex during visual stimulation as compared to the resting state, which is in line 
      with previous studies suggesting lateralization in the visual processing. However, 
      as opposed to permutation testing, our approach does not require inference at the 
      cohort level and can be used for creating sparse connectomes at the level of a 
      single subject.

TI  - Neural correlates of adjunctive rivastigmine treatment to antipsychotics in 
      schizophrenia: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind fMRI study.
PG  - 545-56
AB  - Facilitation of central cholinergic activity may form a potential treatment strategy 
      for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, 
      double-blind, parallel-group design, we investigated the neural correlates of 
      cognitive effects of rivastigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, given as an 
      add-on therapy to antipsychotic-treated schizophrenia patients. Thirty-six chronic 
      schizophrenia patients with mild cognitive impairment took part. After 1 week on 
      placebo (baseline), all patients entered a double-blind protocol; 18 were allocated 
      to receive rivastigmine and 18 placebo for the next 12 weeks (final sample with 
      usable imaging data: 11 patients on rivastigmine, 10 on placebo). All patients 
      underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during a parametric 'n-back' task, 
      involving monitoring of dots in particular locations on a screen at a given delay 
      from the original occurrence, twice: at baseline and 12 weeks 
      post-rivastigmine/placebo treatment. Compared to placebo, rivastigmine produced only 
      a small and non-significant improvement in task accuracy across all conditions with 
      no change in response latency, and increased activity in the extrastriate visual 
      cortex in areas associated with visual and spatial attention but not in any region 
      within the working memory network. Our observations suggest that cholinergic 
      enhancement with rivastigmine at doses known to be effective in Alzheimer's disease 
      does not produce strong and clinically meaningful cognitive and neural changes in 
      schizophrenia patients treated with atypical antipsychotics although the neural 
      effects in terms of enhanced neuronal activity in regions associated with visual and 
      spatial attention are consistent with those reported previously with cholinergic 
      enhancement in healthy subjects.

AB  - Executive function is a quintessential human capacity that emerges late in 
      development and displays different developmental trends in males and females. Sex 
      differences in executive function in youth have been linked to vulnerability to 
      psychopathology as well as to behaviors that impinge on health, wellbeing, and 
      longevity. Yet, the neurobiological basis of these differences is not well 
      understood, in part due to the spatiotemporal complexity inherent in patterns of 
      brain network maturation supporting executive function. Here we test the hypothesis 
      that sex differences in impulsivity in youth stem from sex differences in the 
      controllability of structural brain networks as they rewire over development. 
      Combining methods from network neuroscience and network control theory, we 
      characterize the network control properties of structural brain networks estimated 
      from diffusion imaging data acquired in males and females in a sample of 879 youth 
      aged 8-22 years. We summarize the control properties of these networks by estimating 
      average and modal controllability, two statistics that probe the ease with which 
      brain areas can drive the network towards easy versus difficult-to-reach states. We 
      find that females have higher modal controllability in frontal, parietal, and 
      subcortical regions while males have higher average controllability in frontal and 
      subcortical regions. Furthermore, controllability profiles in males are negatively 
      related to the false positive rate on a continuous performance task, a common 
      measure of impulsivity. Finally, we find associations between average 
      controllability and individual differences in activation during an n-back working 
      memory task. Taken together, our findings support the notion that sex differences in 
      the controllability of structural brain networks can partially explain sex 
      differences in executive function. Controllability of structural brain networks also 
      predicts features of task-relevant activation, suggesting the potential for 
      controllability to represent context-specific constraints on network state more 
      generally.

TI  - The effects of CPAP treatment on task positive and default mode networks in 
      obstructive sleep apnea patients: an fMRI study.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies enable the investigation 
      of neural correlates underlying behavioral performance. We investigate the effect of 
      active and sham Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) treatment on working 
      memory function of patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) considering 
      Task Positive and Default Mode networks (TPN and DMN). METHODS: An experiment with 4 
      levels of visuospatial n-back task was used to investigate the pattern of cortical 
      activation in 17 men with moderate or severe OSAS before and after 2 months of 
      therapeutic (active) or sub-therapeutic (sham) CPAP treatment. RESULTS: Patients 
      with untreated OSAS had significantly less deactivation in the temporal regions of 
      the DMN as compared to healthy controls, but activation within TPN regions was 
      comparatively relatively preserved. After 2 months of treatment, active and sham 
      CPAP groups exhibited opposite trends of cerebral activation and deactivation. After 
      treatment, the active CPAP group demonstrated an increase of cerebral activation in 
      the TPN at all task levels and of task-related cerebral deactivation in the anterior 
      midline and medial temporal regions of the DMN at the 3-back level, associated with 
      a significant improvement of behavioral performance, whereas the sham CPAP group 
      exhibited less deactivation in the temporal regions of Default Mode Network and less 
      Task Positive Network activation associated to longer response times at the 3-back. 
      CONCLUSION: OSAS has a significant negative impact primarily on task-related DMN 
      deactivation, particularly in the medial temporal regions, possibly due to nocturnal 
      hypoxemia, as well as TPN activation, particularly in the right ventral 
      fronto-parietal network. After 2 months of active nasal CPAP treatment a positive 
      response was noted in both TPN and DMN but without compete recovery of existing 
      behavioral and neuronal deficits. Initiation of CPAP treatment early in the course 
      of the disease may prevent or slow down the occurrence of irreversible impairment.

TI  - Neurocognitive and functional heterogeneity in depressed youth.
PG  - 783-790
LID - 10.1038/s41386-020-00871-w [doi]
AB  - Depression is a common psychiatric illness that often begins in youth, and is 
      sometimes associated with cognitive deficits. However, there is significant 
      variability in cognitive dysfunction, likely reflecting biological heterogeneity. We 
      sought to identify neurocognitive subtypes and their neurofunctional signatures in a 
      large cross-sectional sample of depressed youth. Participants were drawn from the 
      Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, including 712 youth with a lifetime history 
      of a major depressive episode and 712 typically developing (TD) youth matched on age 
      and sex. A subset (MDD n = 368, TD n = 200) also completed neuroimaging. Cognition 
      was assessed with the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery. A recently developed 
      semi-supervised machine learning algorithm was used to delineate neurocognitive 
      subtypes. Subtypes were evaluated for differences in both clinical psychopathology 
      and brain activation during an n-back working memory fMRI task. We identified three 
      neurocognitive subtypes in the depressed group. Subtype 1 was high-performing (high 
      accuracy, moderate speed), Subtype 2 was cognitively impaired (low accuracy, slow 
      speed), and Subtype 3 was impulsive (low accuracy, fast speed). While subtypes did 
      not differ in clinical psychopathology, they diverged in their activation profiles 
      in regions critical for executive function, which mirrored differences in cognition. 
      Taken together, these data suggest disparate mechanisms of cognitive vulnerability 
      and resilience in depressed youth, which may inform the identification of biomarkers 
      for prognosis and treatment response.

TI  - The effects of six months Persicaria minor extract supplement among older adults 
      with mild cognitive impairment: a double-blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled 
      trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Persicaria minor extract exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory 
      properties and has potential effects on cognitive function and mood. However, the 
      effects of P.minor on brain activation and biomarkers have not been studied among 
      older adults. This multicentre, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study 
      aimed to investigate the effect of 6 months P.minor extract supplement (Biokesum®) 
      on cognition, mood, biomarkers, and brain activation among older adults with Mild 
      Cognitive Impairment (MCI). METHOD: A total of 36 Malaysian community-dwelling older 
      adults with MCI (60-75-year-old) were randomized into Biokesum® (n = 18) and placebo 
      group (n = 18). Each subject consumed one capsule of Biokesum® (250 mg/capsule) or 
      placebo (maltodextrin, 280 mg/capsule) twice daily for 6 months. Cognitive function 
      and mood were assessed at baseline, 3rd, and 6th-month using neuropsychological 
      tests (MMSE, Digit Span, RAVLT, Digit Symbol, and Visual Reproduction) and Profile 
      of Mood State (POMS) questionnaire. Blood lipid profile, fasting blood glucose, and 
      biomarkers (MDA, LPO, COX-2, iNOS, and BDNF) were measured at baseline and 6th 
      month. By the end of the intervention, there were 30 compliers (Biokesum®: N = 15; 
      Placebo: N = 15) and 6 dropouts. For brain activation assessment, 15 subsamples 
      (Biokesum®: N = 8; Placebo: N = 7) completed N-back and Stroop tasks during fMRI 
      scanning at baseline and 6th month. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's 
      area 9 and 46) was identified as a region of interest (ROI) for brain activation 
      analysis using SPM software. RESULTS: Two-way mixed ANOVA analysis showed 
      significant improvements in Visual Reproduction II (p = 0.012, partial 
      η(2) = 0.470), tension (p = 0.042, partial η(2) = 0.147), anger (p = 0.010, partial 
      η(2) = 0.207), confusion (p = 0.041, partial η(2) = 0.148), total negative subscales 
      (p = 0.043, partial η(2) = 0.145), BDNF (p = 0.020, partial η(2) = 0.179) and 
      triglyceride (p = 0.029, partial η(2) = 0.237) following 6 months of Biokesum® 
      supplementation. Preliminary finding also demonstrated significant improvement at 
      0-back task-induced right DLPFC activation (p = 0.028, partial η(2) = 0.652) among 
      subsamples in Biokesum® group. No adverse events were reported at the end of the 
      study. CONCLUSION: Six months Biokesum® supplementation potentially improved visual 
      memory, negative mood, BDNF, and triglyceride levels among older adults with MCI. 
      Significant findings on brain activation at the right DPLFC must be considered as 
      preliminary. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Retrospectively registered on 30th August 2019 [ 
      ISRC TN12417552 ].
