The Orbitofrontal Cortex (OFC) is a cortical structure that has implications in cognition, memory, reward anticipation, outcome evaluation, decision  making, and learning. As such, OFC activity correlates with these cognitive brain  abilities. Despite research suggesting race and socioeconomic status (SES)  indicators such as parental education may be associated with OFC activity, limited  knowledge exists on multiplicative effects of race and parental education on OFC  activity and associated cognitive ability. Purpose. Using functional brain imaging  data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, we tested the  multiplicative effects of race and parental education on left lateral OFC activity  during an N-Back task. In our study, we used a sociological rather than biological  theory that conceptualizes race and SES as proxies of access to the opportunity  structure and exposure to social adversities rather than innate and non-modifiable  brain differences. We explored racial variation in the effect of parental  educational attainment, a primary indicator of SES, on left lateral OFC activity  during an N-Back task between Black and White 9-10 years old adolescents. Methods.  The ABCD study is a national, landmark, multi-center brain imaging investigation of  American adolescents. The total sample was 4290 9-10 years old Black or White  adolescents. The independent variables were SES indicators, namely family income,  parental education, and neighborhood income. The primary outcome was the average  beta weight for N-Back (2 back versus 0 back contrast) in ASEG ROI left OFC  activity, measured by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) during an N-Back  task. Ethnicity, age, sex, subjective SES, and family structure were the study  covariates. For data analysis, we used linear regression models. Results. In White  but not Black adolescents, parental education was associated with higher left  lateral OFC activity during the N-Back task. In the pooled sample, we found a  significant interaction between race and parental education on the outcome,  suggesting that high parental education is associated with a larger increase in left  OFC activity of White than Black adolescents. Conclusions. For American adolescents,  race and SES jointly influence left lateral OFC activity correlated with cognition,  memory, decision making, and learning. Given the central role of left lateral OFC  activity in learning and memory, our finding calls for additional research on  contextual factors that reduce the gain of SES for Black adolescents. Cognitive  inequalities are not merely due to the additive effects of race and SES but also its  multiplicative effects.",2021-03-22,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,,NA,3,11,NA,Brain Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 33809905  PMCID: PMC8004246,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/72KZLGUB/Assari et al. - 2021 - Parental Education and Left Lateral Orbitofrontal .pdf,NA,adolescents; brain development; cognitive; fMRI; learning; memory; N-Back; orbitofrontal cortex; population groups; socioeconomic factors,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Assari et al. - 2021 - Parental Education and Left Lateral Orbitofrontal .pdf

We additionally provide an index of the  validity of the proposed paradigm and test whether the experimental task  discriminates the behavioural performances of healthy participants from those of  individuals with working memory deficits. Ten healthy participants and nine patients  presenting working memory (WM) deficits due to acquired brain injury (ABI) performed  the developed task. To inspect whether the paradigm activates brain areas typically  involved in visual working memory (VWM), brain activation of the healthy  participants was assessed with fMRIs. To examine the task's capacity to discriminate  behavioural data, performances of the healthy participants in the task were compared  with those of ABI patients. Data were analysed with GLM-based random effects  procedures and t-tests. We found an increase of the BOLD signal in the specialized  areas of VWM. Concerning behavioural performances, healthy participants showed the  predicted pattern of more hits, less omissions and a tendency for fewer false  alarms, more self-corrected responses, and faster reaction times, when compared with  subjects presenting WM impairments. The results suggest that this task activates  brain areas involved in VWM and discriminates behavioural performances of clinical  and non-clinical groups.

The inter-regional connectivity among the WM regions during  task preparation has not yet been investigated. We examined this question using the  graph modeling methods IMaGES and LOFS, applied to the previously published fMRI  data of Manelis and Reder (2013). In that study, subjects performed 1-, 2-, and  3-back tasks. Each block of n-back was preceded by a preparation period and followed  by a rest period. The analyses of task-related brain activity identified a network  of 18 regions that increased in activation from 1- to 3-back (Increase network) and  a network of 17 regions that decreased in activation from 1- to 3-back (Decrease  network). The graph analyses revealed two types of connectivity sub-networks within  the Increase and Decrease networks: ""default"" and ""preparation-related."" The  ""default"" connectivity was present not only during task performance, but also during  task preparation and during rest. We propose that this sub-network may serve as a  core system that allows one to quickly activate cognitive, perceptual and motor  systems in response to the relevant stimuli. The ""preparation-related"" connectivity  was present during task preparation and task performance, but not at rest, and  depended on the n-back condition.

The impairment of working memory has been found related to the  abnormal activity of human brain regions in many functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI) studies. This study investigated how brain region activation was  altered in schizophrenia and how it was inherited independently from performance  deficits. METHOD: The authors used fMRI method during N-back task to assess working  memory related cortical activation in four groups (N = 20 in each group, matching  task performance, age, gender and education): schizophrenic patients, their  unaffected biological parents, young healthy controls for the patients and older  healthy controls for their parents. RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, patients  showed an exaggerated response in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (brodmann  area [BA] 46) and bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and had reduced  activation in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 9). In the conjunction  analysis, the effect of genetic risk (parents versus older control) shared  significantly overlapped activation with effect of disease (patients versus young  control) in the right middle frontal gyrus (BA 46) and left inferior parietal gyrus  (BA 40).

Additional to the relation between suffering from chronic stress and depression,  both stress (acute and chronic) and depression are associated with cognitive  alterations, including working memory. The breakup of a relationship is considered  to be a stressful event that can lead to symptoms of depression in otherwise healthy  people. Additional to elevated depression scores, stress-related cognitive  alterations may occur in this population as well. Therefore, in the present fMRI  study we investigated whether experiencing a relationship breakup is associated with  working memory alterations and whether this is related to depressive symptom  severity. A three workload version of the n-back task (0-back, 1-back, 2-back) was  used to measure working memory in subjects who experienced a breakup in the  preceding 6 months (""heartbreak group"", n = 70) and subjects in a romantic  relationship (""relationship group"", n = 46). Behavioral task performance was  compared between the two groups. Functional MRI scans were analyzed using General  Linear Model (GLM) activation analyses. Workload conditions were contrasted to each  other and to baseline and group differences were assessed. To investigate whether  brain networks are associated with depressive symptom severity within the heartbreak  group specifically, a post hoc feature-based Independent Component Analysis was  performed on the 2-back > 0-back contrast images to identify brain regions that  covaried across subjects. Behaviorally, the heartbreak group performed similar at  high workload (i.e., 2-back) and better at moderate workload (i.e., 1-back) than the  relationship group. GLM analysis revealed an interaction between group and 2-back >  0-back, 2-back > 1-back and 2-back > baseline; the heartbreak group showed less  precuneus activation compared to the relationship group. Furthermore, within the  heartbreak group, we found a negative association between depressive symptom  severity and a brain network representing mostly the precuneus, anterior cingulate  gyrus and supplementary motor cortex. Our findings suggest that the effect of a  breakup is accompanied by workload-dependent working memory alterations.

While working memory and emotional processing-related brain function are consistently impaired in  psychoses unrelated to the puerperium, no studies have investigated them in PP.  METHODS: Twenty-four women at risk of developing PP (11 developed an episode - PE;  13 remained well - NPE) and 20 healthy postpartum women completed two functional  magnetic resonance imaging tasks within a year of delivery: working memory (n-back)  and emotional face recognition (fearful faces). We compared women at-risk of PP to  controls, as well as NPE, PE, and controls to test for potential effects of a PP  episode occurrence. RESULTS: Women at-risk of PP and PE showed hyperactivation of  lateral visual areas, precuneus, and posterior cingulate during the n-back task. The  at-risk group as a whole, as well as the PE and NPE groups, showed hyperconnectivity  of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with various  parieto-occipito-temporo-cerebellar regions compared to controls during several  n-back conditions. Increases in connectivity between the right DLPFC and ipsilateral  middle temporal gyrus were observed in the PE group compared to NPE during 2-back.  During the fearful faces task, at-risk women as a group showed hyperactivation of  fronto-cingulo-subcortical regions, and hypoconnectivity between the left amygdala  and ipsilateral occipito-parietal regions compared to controls.

Functional  magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography provide complementary  spatiotemporal information and simultaneous recording of these two modalities can  remove inter-session drug response and environment variability. We sought to assess  the effects of ketamine and midazolam on simultaneous electrophysiological and  hemodynamic recordings during working memory (WM) processes. Thirty participants  were included in a placebo-controlled, three-way crossover design with ketamine and  midazolam. Compared to placebo, ketamine administration attenuated theta power  increases and alpha power decreases and midazolam attenuated low beta band decreases  to increasing WM load. Additionally, ketamine caused larger blood-oxygen-dependent  (BOLD) signal increases in the supplementary motor area and angular gyrus, and  weaker deactivations of the default mode network (DMN), whereas no difference was  found between midazolam and placebo. Ketamine administration caused positive  temporal correlations between frontal-midline theta (fm-theta) power and the BOLD  signal to disappear and attenuated negative correlations.

However, the relation of these rapid changes in  functional organization to cognitive functioning is not well understood. This study  used a graph-based time-frame modularity analysis approach to identify temporally  recurrent functional configuration patterns in neural responses to an n-back working  memory task during fMRI. Working memory load was manipulated to investigate the  functional relevance of the identified brain states. Four distinct brain states were  defined by the predominant patterns of activation in the task-positive,  default-mode, sensorimotor, and visual networks. Associated with escalating working  memory load, the occurrence of the task-positive state and the probability of  transitioning into this state increased. In contrast, the occurrence of the  default-mode and sensorimotor states and the probability of these 2 states  transitioning away from the task-positive state decreased. The task-positive state  occurrence rate and the probability of transitioning from the default-mode state  back to the task-positive state explained a significant and unique portion of the  variance in task performance.

Simultaneous EEG-fMRI is a popular multimodal recording approach due to  the complementary spatiotemporal relationship between the two modalities. Several  data fusion techniques have been proposed in the literature for EEG-fMRI fusion,  including joint-ICA and parallel-ICA frameworks. Previous EEG-fMRI fusion approaches  have used sensor-level EEG features. Recently, we introduced source-space ICA for  EEG-MEG source reconstruction and component identification, which was shown to be a  superior alternative to sensor-space ICA. APPROACH: Here, we extend source-space ICA  to the fusion of EEG-fMRI data. Additionally, we incorporate the use of a paradigm  signal (constrained) and a lag-based signal decomposition approach to accommodate  recent findings demonstrating the potentially variable lag structure between  electrophysiological and BOLD signals. We evaluated this method on simulated  concurrent EEG-fMRI during a boxcar task design, as well as real concurrent EEG-fMRI  data from three participants performing an N-Back working memory task. The block  diagram of the algorithm and corresponding source codes are provided. MAIN RESULTS:  Based on the results of the real working memory task, for all three subjects, one  frontal theta component, and one right posterior alpha component had the highest  contribution coefficients (~0.5) to the paradigm-related fused component. There were  also two more alpha band components with contribution coefficients of 0.3. The  highest contributing fMRI component (~0.8) was one known in the literature to be  related to the attention network. The second fMRI component was related to the  well-known default mode network, with a contribution coefficient of 0.3.  SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed EEG-fMRI fusion approach, is capable of estimating the  brain maps of the EEG and fMRI for the fused components and account for the variable  lag structure between electrophysiological and BOLD signals.",Feb-19,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,16017,NA,1,16,NA,J Neural Eng,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: England PMID: 30523889,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/XXV6QCVN/Jonmohamadi et al. - 2019 - Constrained temporal parallel decomposition for EE.pdf,NA,"Humans; Male; Adult; Young Adult; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Brain Mapping/*methods; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods; Brain/*diagnostic imaging/*physiology; Electroencephalography/*methods",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Jonmohamadi et al. - 2019 - Constrained temporal parallel decomposition for EE.pdf

Most  of this work has been conducted in fMRI, but functional near-infrared spectroscopy  (fNIRS) is gaining traction as a less invasive and more flexible alternative to  measuring cortical hemodynamics. Few fNIRS studies, however, have examined how  working memory load-dependent changes in brain hemodynamics relate to performance.  The current study employs a newly developed and robust statistical analysis of  task-based fNIRS data in a large sample, and demonstrates the utility of  data-driven, multivariate analyses to link brain activation and behavior in this  modality. Seventy participants completed a standard N-back task with three N-back  levels (N = 1, 2, 3) while fNIRS data were collected from frontal and parietal  cortex. Overall, participants showed reliably greater fronto-parietal activation for  the 2-back versus the 1-back task, suggesting fronto-parietal fNIRS measurements are  sensitive to differences in cognitive load. The results for 3-back were much less  consistent, potentially due to poor behavioral performance in the 3-back task. To  address this, a multivariate analysis (behavioral partial least squares, PLS) was  conducted to examine the interaction between fNIRS activation and performance at  each N-back level. Results of the PLS analysis demonstrated differences in the  relationship between accuracy and change in the deoxyhemoglobin fNIRS signal as a  function of N-back level in eight mid-frontal channels. Specifically, greater  reductions in deoxyhemoglobin (i.e., more activation) were positively related to  performance on the 3-back task, unrelated to accuracy in the 2-back task, and  negatively associated with accuracy in the 1-back task. This pattern of results  suggests that the metabolic demands correlated with neural activity required for  high levels of accuracy vary as a consequence of task difficulty/cognitive load,  whereby more automaticity during the 1-back task (less mid-frontal activity)  predicted superior performance on this relatively easy task, and successful  engagement of this mid-frontal region was required for high accuracy on a more  difficult and cognitively demanding 3-back task. In summary, we show that fNIRS  activity can track working memory load and can uncover significant associations  between brain activity and performance, thus opening the door for this modality to  be used in more wide-spread applications.",2021-04-15,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,117795,NA,,230,NA,Neuroimage,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,Copyright © 2021.

Using data from the Human  Connectome Project, this study concurrently investigated neurocognitive performance,  neural activation during a working memory task, and cortical brain morphometry in  relation to obesity in a group of young adults, 22-35 years old. METHODS: Using a  case-control design, obese individuals (n = 243, body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/m(2))  were compared to a control group of lean BMI individuals (n = 469,  BMI = 18-24.9 kg/m(2)). Performance tests comprised a battery of behavioral  neurocognitive assessments. Neural activity was measured as  blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) activity during an N-Back task using  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Cortical morphometry included indices  of volume, thickness, and surface area. RESULTS: Relative to the control group, the  obese group exhibited significantly worse performance in terms of the National  Institutes of Health Toolkit (NIH) 9-Hole Peg Board, Penn Working Memory Test, Delay  Discounting, Penn Progressive Matrices, NIH Picture Vocabulary Test, Dimensional  Change Card Sort Test and the in-scanner N-Back working memory test (FDR-corrected  ps<0.05; ds = 0.231-0.405). The obese group also exhibited significantly greater  BOLD activation in N-Back task-negative regions, including the ventromedial  prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, and right precentral gyrus (FDR-corrected  ps<0.05).

Here, we first characterize two whole-brain  functional connectivity networks based on fMRI data acquired during an n-back task  that robustly predict individual differences in two important forms of LTM,  recognition and recollection. We then focus on the recognition memory model and  contrast it with a working memory model. Although functional connectivity during the  n-back task also predicts working memory performance and the two networks have some  shared components, they are also largely distinct from each other: The recognition  memory model performance remains robust when we control for working memory, and vice  versa. Functional connectivity only within regions traditionally associated with LTM  formation, such as the medial temporal lobe and those that show univariate  subsequent memory effect, have little predictive power for both forms of LTM.  Interestingly, the interactions between these regions and other brain regions play a  more substantial role in predicting recollection memory than recognition memory.

The fMRI data are collected from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC)  for the prediction of brain age in adolescents. Due to extremely large  variable-to-instance ratio of PNC data, a high-dimensional matrix with several  irrelevant and highly correlated features is generated, and hence a sparse learning  approach is necessary to extract effective features from fMRI data. We propose a  sparse learner based on the residual errors along the estimation of an inverse  problem for extreme learning machine (ELM).

METHOD: PET and fMRI scans were obtained from women  with prospectively confirmed PMDD and asymptomatic comparison subjects while they  completed the n-back task during three hormone conditions: ovarian suppression  induced by the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist leuprolide acetate, leuprolide  plus estradiol, and leuprolide plus progesterone. Fifteen patients and 15 matched  comparison subjects underwent PET imaging. Fourteen patients and 14 comparison  subjects underwent fMRI. For each hormone condition, rCBF was measured with [15O]H2O  PET, and BOLD signal was measured with fMRI, both during an n-back working memory  paradigm. Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF) scores and clinical  characteristics were obtained for each patient before hormone manipulation, and  symptoms were measured before and during the protocol. RESULTS: In both the PET and  fMRI studies, a main effect of diagnosis was observed, with PMDD patients showing  greater prefrontal activation than comparison subjects. In the patient group, the  degree to which dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation was abnormally increased  correlated with several dimensions of disease: disability as indicated by GAF  scores, age at symptom onset, duration of PMDD, and differences in pre- and  postmenses PMDD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal working memory activation in PMDD,  specifically in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, is related to PMDD severity,  symptoms, age at onset, and disease burden. These results support the clinical  relevance of the findings and the proposal that dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  dysfunction represents a substrate of risk for PMDD.

Clinical,NA,2213-1582,10.1016/j.nicl.2022.102936,NA,"BACKGROUND: People with traumatic brain injury (TBI) often experience fatigue, but an understanding of the neural underpinnings of fatigue following TBI is still  lacking. This study used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging  (rs-fMRI) to examine associations between functional connectivity (FC) changes and  task-induced changes in subjective fatigue in people with moderate-severe TBI.  METHODS: Sixteen people with moderate-severe TBI and 17 matched healthy controls  (HC) performed an adaptive N-back task (working memory task) to induce cognitive  fatigue. Before and after the task they rated their state fatigue level and  underwent rs-fMRI. Seed-to-voxel analyses with seeds in areas involved in cognitive  fatigue, namely the striatum and default mode network (DMN) including, medial  prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, were performed. RESULTS: The  adaptive N-back task was effective in inducing fatigue in both groups. Subjective  task-induced fatigue was positively associated with FC between striatum and  precuneus in people with TBI, while there was a negative association in HC. In  contrast, subjective task-induced fatigue was negatively associated with FC between  striatum and cerebellum in the TBI group, while there was no association in HC.  Similar associations between task-induced subjective fatigue and DMN FC were found  across the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the subjective experience  of fatigue was linked to DMN connectivity in both groups and was differently  associated with striatal connectivity in people with moderate-severe TBI compared to  HC. Defining fatigue-induced neuronal network changes is pertinent to the  development of treatments that target abnormal neuronal activity after TBI.",2022,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,102936,NA,,33,NA,Neuroimage Clin,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the sub-acute administration of an antidepressant  (escitalopram) would induce differences in cognitive performance and associated  brain function, which could be observed within the normal power of a functional  imaging study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy adults (N=10) received a short course  of escitalopram (10 mg/day for 7 days). Participants performed a parametric working  memory (WM) task during BOLD fMRI, both while medication-free and after medication.  To control for order effects, the medication-free examination was completed by half  the subjects before starting medication and by the other half at least one week  after medication. RESULTS: Escitalopram had no significant effect on WM accuracy or  reaction time. Preliminary analysis of the imaging data revealed no significant  (p(corrected)<0.05) differences in memory-load-dependent activation between  conditions. However, small volume correction analysis of regions that were  significant prior to correction for multiple comparisons highlighted between  condition differences in regions likely to be susceptible to antidepressant effects  (i.e. thalamus, anterior cingulate and inferior frontal gyrus). CONCLUSIONS: These  results suggest that the sub-acute administration of antidepressants in healthy  controls does not affect cognitive or hemodynamic function in healthy adults to a  magnitude greater than one standard deviation unit. Therefore, the confounding  effect of antidepressants on signal intensity in imaging studies of medicated,  depressed individuals may be limited.",Apr-06,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,339-347,NA,3,185,NA,Psychopharmacology (Berl),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: Germany PMID: 16525858,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/ZTIG28RM/Rose et al. - 2006 - The effects of escitalopram on working memory and .pdf,NA,Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Cross-Over Studies; Antidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects; Brain/*drug effects/physiology; Citalopram/administration & dosage/*adverse effects; Cognition/*drug effects; Drug Administration Schedule; Memory/*drug effects,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rose et al. - 2006 - The effects of escitalopram on working memory and .pdf

Yet, for over 100 years, researchers have been unable to identify an objective,  behavioral measure that covaries with the subjective experience of fatigue. Previous  work suggests that the metrics of signal detection theory (SDT)-response bias  (criterion) and perceptual certainty (d')-may change as a function of fatigue, but  no work has yet been done to examine whether these metrics covary with fatigue.  Here, we investigated cognitive fatigue using SDT. We induced fatigue through  repetitive performance of the n-back working memory task, while functional magnetic  resonance imaging (fMRI) data was acquired. We also assessed cognitive fatigue at  intervals throughout. This enabled us to assess not only whether criterion and d'  covary with cognitive fatigue but also whether similar patterns of brain activation  underlie cognitive fatigue and SDT measures. Our results show that both criterion  and d' were correlated with changes in cognitive fatigue: as fatigue increased,  subjects became more conservative in their response bias and their perceptual  certainty declined. Furthermore, activation in the striatum of the basal ganglia was  also related to cognitive fatigue, criterion, and d'. These results suggest that SDT  measures represent an objective measure of cognitive fatigue. Additionally, the  overlap and difference in the fMRI results between cognitive fatigue and SDT  measures indicate that these measures are related while also separate. In sum, we  show the relevance of SDT measures in the understanding of fatigue, thus providing  researchers with a new set of tools with which to better understand the nature and  consequences of cognitive fatigue.",2020,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,579188,NA,,11,NA,Front Psychol,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,"Copyright © 2021 Wylie, Yao, Sandry and DeLuca.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 33519595  PMCID: PMC7844088,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/KNRV57AS/Wylie et al. - 2020 - Using Signal Detection Theory to Better Understand.pdf,NA,fMRI; working memory; cognitive fatigue; signal detection theory; striatum,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Wylie et al. - 2020 - Using Signal Detection Theory to Better Understand.pdf

Widespread cortical and subcortical regions evidenced increased mean variability  with increasing age, with no regions evidencing age-related decrease in variability.  Additionally, posterior cingulate/precuneus exhibited increased variability to WM  difficulty. Notably, both age-related increases in BOLD variability were associated  with significantly poorer WM performance in all but the oldest adults.

Even though  neurobiological bases of BD have still to be further elucidated, recent neuroimaging  studies provided compelling evidence about functional correlates of cognitive  deficits in BD patients, with working memory (WM) impairment being one of the most  commonly reported findings. Such dysfunctions are likely to persist beyond acute  phases of the illness, so they qualify as endophenotypic markers for the disorder.  This review sought to synthesize, through a MEDLINE search up to December 2012,  published functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies on WM networks,  conducted through N-back task in euthymic BD I patients and including a control  comparison group. Eight studies meeting the search criteria were identified. Despite  heterogeneity across findings, particularly in relation to task performance (i.e.  accuracy and reaction time), most studies reported a loss of connectivity in BD  patients' prefrontal networks, traditionally involved in WM, as well as patterns of  abnormal activation in the dorso/ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, other prefrontal  areas and the parietal and temporal cortex. These findings suggest the involvement  of intact secondary systems in order to overcome lack of integrity across WM  circuits in BD patients. Further investigation in the field is warranted.",2013,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,63-70,NA,2,68,NA,Neuropsychobiology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,"Copyright © 2013 S.

However to date, the bulk of neuroimaging literature has  focused largely on the maintenance aspect of visuo-spatial WM, with a scarcity of  research into the aspects of WM involving manipulation of information. Thus, this  study aimed to compare maintenance-only with maintenance and manipulation of  visuo-spatial stimuli (3D cube shapes) utilizing a 1-back task while functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were acquired. Sixteen healthy participants  (9 women, M = 23.94 years, SD = 2.49) were required to perform the 1-back task with  or without mentally rotating the shapes 90° on a vertical axis. When no rotation was  required (maintenance-only condition), a right hemispheric lateralization was  revealed across fronto-parietal areas. However, when the task involved maintaining  and manipulating the same stimuli through 90° rotation, activation was primarily  seen in the bilateral parietal lobe and left fusiform gyrus. The findings confirm  that the well-established right lateralized fronto-parietal networks are likely to  underlie simple maintenance of visuo-spatial stimuli. The results also suggest that  the added demand of manipulation of information maintained online appears to require  further neural recruitment of functionally related areas. In particular mental  rotation of visuospatial stimuli required bilateral parietal areas, and the left  fusiform gyrus potentially to maintain a categorical or object representation. It  can be concluded that WM is a complex neural process involving the interaction of an  increasingly large network.",2016,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,87,NA,,10,NA,Front Behav Neurosci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 27199694  PMCID: PMC4858518,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/3ZZ27YWZ/Lamp et al. - 2016 - Mapping of the Underlying Neural Mechanisms of Mai.pdf,NA,fMRI; working memory; n-back; maintenance; manipulation; mental rotation,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Lamp et al. - 2016 - Mapping of the Underlying Neural Mechanisms of Mai.pdf

While this proposal has received support  in neuropsychological studies, it has been relatively little tested using functional  imaging. This study aimed to examine brain activations associated with FTD, and its  two main factor-analytically derived subsyndromes, during the performance of a  working memory task. METHODS: Seventy patients with schizophrenia showing a full  range of FTD scores and 70 matched healthy controls underwent fMRI during the  performance of the 2-back version of the n-back task. Whole-brain corrected,  voxel-based correlations with FTD scores were examined in the patient group.  RESULTS: During 2-back performance the patients showed clusters of significant  inverse correlation with FTD scores in the inferior frontal cortex and dorsolateral  prefrontal cortex bilaterally, the left temporal cortex and subcortically in the  basal ganglia and thalamus. Further analysis revealed that these correlations  reflected an association only with 'alogia' (poverty of speech, poverty of content  of speech and perseveration) and not with the 'fluent disorganization' component of  FTD. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides functional imaging support for the view that  FTD in schizophrenia may involve impaired executive/frontal function.

However, this thalamocortical imbalance  has not been studied during task engagement to date, limiting our understanding of  its role in cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. METHODS: Both n-back working  memory (WM) task-fMRI and resting-state fMRI data were collected from 172 patients  with SCZ and 103 healthy control subjects (HC). A replication sample with 49 SCZ and  48 HC was independently obtained. Sixteen thalamic subdivisions were employed as  seeds for the analysis. RESULTS: During both task-performance and rest, SCZ showed  thalamic hyperconnectivity with sensorimotor cortices, but hypoconnectivity with  prefrontal-cerebellar regions relative to controls. Higher sensorimotor-thalamic  connectivity and lower prefronto-thalamic connectivity both relate to poorer WM  performance (lower task accuracy and longer response time) and difficulties in  discriminating target from nontarget (lower d' score) in n-back task. The  prefronto-thalamic hypoconnectivity and sensorimotor-thalamic hyperconnectivity were  anti-correlated both in SCZ and HCs; this anti-correlation was more pronounced with  less cognitive demand (rest>0-back>2-back). These findings replicated well in the  second sample. Finally, the hypo- and hyper-connectivity patterns during  resting-state positively correlated with the hypo- and hyper-connectivity during  2-back task-state in SCZ respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The thalamocortical imbalance  reflected by prefronto-thalamic hypoconnectivity and sensorimotor-thalamic  hyperconnectivity is present both at rest and during task engagement in SCZ and  relates to working memory performance. The frontal reduction, sensorimotor  enhancement pattern of thalamocortical imbalance is a state-invariant feature of SCZ  that affects a core cognitive function.",2022-01-21,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,251-261,NA,1,48,NA,Schizophr Bull,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,"© The Author(s) 2021.

Although  motor symptoms may be the most prominent presentation, cognitive symptoms such as  memory deficits and executive dysfunction typically co-occur. We used functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and task fMRI-based dynamic causal modeling (DCM)  to evaluate HD-related changes in the neural network underlying working memory (WM).  Sixty-four pre-symptomatic HD mutation carriers (preHD), 20 patients with early  manifest HD symptoms (earlyHD), and 83 healthy control subjects performed an n-back  fMRI task with two levels of WM load. Effective connectivity was assessed in five  predefined regions of interest, comprising bilateral inferior parietal cortex, left  anterior cingulate cortex, and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. HD mutation  carriers performed less accurately and more slowly at high WM load compared with the  control group. While between-group comparisons of brain activation did not reveal  differential recruitment of the cortical WM network in mutation carriers,  comparisons of brain connectivity as identified with DCM revealed a number of group  differences across the whole WM network. Most strikingly, we observed decreasing  connectivity from several regions toward right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  (rDLPFC) in preHD and even more so in earlyHD. The deterioration in rDLPFC  connectivity complements results from previous studies and might mirror beginning  cortical neural decline at premanifest and early manifest stages of HD.

Aerobic fitness is associated with cognitive  benefits in typically developing children and physical exercise promotes recovery  following brain injury. Accordingly, we investigated cognitive and neural correlates  of aerobic fitness in a sample of craniopharyngioma patients. METHODS: Patients  treated for craniopharyngioma [N=104, 10.0±4.6 years, 48% male] participated in  fitness, cognitive and fMRI (n=51) assessments following surgery but before proton  radiation therapy. RESULTS: Patients demonstrated impaired aerobic fitness [peak  oxygen uptake (PKVO2)=23.9±7.1, 41% impaired (i.e., 1.5 SD&lt;normative mean)],  motor proficiency [Bruininks-Oseretsky (BOT2)=38.6±9.0, 28% impaired], and executive  functions (e.g., WISC-IV Working Memory Index (WMI)=96.0±15.3, 11% impaired). PKVO2  correlated with better executive functions (e.g., WISC-IV WMI r=.27, p=.02) and  academic performance (WJ-III Calculation r=.24, p=.04). BOT2 correlated with better  attention (e.g., CPT-II omissions r=.26, p=.04) and executive functions (e.g.,  WISC-IV WMI r=.32, p=.01). Areas of robust neural activation during an n-back task  included superior parietal lobule, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and middle and  superior frontal gyri (p&lt;.05, corrected). Higher network activation was  associated with better working memory task performance and better BOT2 (p&lt;.001).  CONCLUSIONS: Before adjuvant therapy, children with craniopharyngioma demonstrate  significantly reduced aerobic fitness, motor proficiency, and working memory. Better  aerobic fitness and motor proficiency are associated with better attention and  executive functions, as well as greater activation of a well-established working  memory network. These findings may help explain differential risk/resiliency with  respect to acute cognitive changes that may portend cognitive late effects.

The aim of this functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI) study was to examine the effects of action-based cognitive  remediation (ABCR) on early change in the dPFC blood-oxygen-level-dependent response  in patients with BD in remission, and whether the observed neural change predicted  improved executive functions following 10 weeks of treatment. Forty-five  participants with remitted BD (ABCR: n = 26, control treatment: n = 19) completed a  spatial n-back working memory task during fMRI and executive function tasks outside  the scanner before and after two weeks of ABCR/control treatment, and an additional  assessment of executive function at treatment completion. Thirty-four healthy  controls underwent a single fMRI and executive function assessment for baseline  comparisons. We found an early reversal of pretreatment hypo-activity in the  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) following ABCR vs. control during both  high-load (2-back > 1-back) working memory (WM) (F(1,43) = 5.69, p = 0.02,  η(2) = 0.12) and general WM (2-back > 0-back) (F(1,43) = 5.61, p = 0.02,  η(2) = 0.12). This dlPFC activity increase predicted improved executive functions at  treatment completion (high-load WM: B = -0.45, p = 0.01, general WM: B = -0.41,  p < 0.01), independent of changes in subsyndromal symptoms. In conclusion, early  dPFC increase may provide a neurocircuitry-based biomarker for pro-cognitive  effects. Future cognition trials should include fMRI assessments to confirm the  validity of this putative biomarker model across disorders with cognitive  impairment.",May-21,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,1113-1121,NA,6,46,NA,Neuropsychopharmacology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 33168945  PMCID: PMC8115100,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/UC4QY9BA/Ott et al. - 2021 - Change in prefrontal activity and executive functi.pdf,NA,"Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Memory, Short-Term; Executive Function; Cognition; *Bipolar Disorder/diagnostic imaging/therapy; *Cognitive Remediation; Prefrontal Cortex/diagnostic imaging",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Ott et al. - 2021 - Change in prefrontal activity and executive functi.pdf

All functional atlases to date have been derived from  resting-state fMRI data. But given that functional connectivity between regions  varies with task, we hypothesized that an atlas incorporating both resting-state and  task-based fMRI data would produce an atlas with finer characterization of  task-relevant regions than an atlas derived from resting-state alone. To test this  hypothesis, we derived parcellation atlases from twenty-nine healthy adult  participants enrolled in the Cognitive Connectome project, an initiative to improve  functional MRI's translation into clinical decision-making by mapping normative  variance in brain-behavior relationships. Participants underwent resting-state and  task-based fMRI spanning nine cognitive domains: motor, visuospatial, attention,  language, memory, affective processing, decision-making, working memory, and  executive function. Spatially constrained n-cut parcellation derived brain atlases  using (1) all participants' functional data (Task) or (2) a single resting-state  scan (Rest). An atlas was also derived from random parcellation for comparison  purposes (Random). Two methods were compared: (1) a parcellation applied to the  group's mean edge weights (mean), and (2) a two-stage approach with parcellation of  individual edge weights followed by parcellation of mean binarized edges  (two-stage). The resulting Task and Rest atlases had significantly greater  similarity with each other (mean Jaccard indices JI=0.72-0.85) than with the Random  atlases (JI=0.59-0.63; all p<0.001 after Bonferroni correction). Task and Rest atlas  similarity was greatest for the two-stage method (JI=0.85), which has been shown as  more robust than the mean method; these atlases also better reproduced voxelwise  seed maps of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during rest and performing the  n-back working memory task (r=0.75-0.80) than the Random atlases (r=0.64-0.72),  further validating their utility. We expected regions governing higher-order  cognition (such as frontal and anterior temporal lobes) to show greatest difference  between Task and Rest atlases; contrary to expectations, these areas had greatest  similarity between atlases. Our findings indicate that atlases derived from  parcellation of task-based and resting-state fMRI data are highly comparable, and  existing resting-state atlases are suitable for task-based analyses.

METHODS: In total, 12 clinically isolated syndromes (CIS) patients at  risk of MS, 38 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), 22 secondary  progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) and 24 healthy controls (HC) performed an  N-back fMRI task. Correlations between fMRI abnormalities and clinico-behavioural  and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures were assessed. RESULTS:  Participants activated brain regions of the working memory network, especially in  fronto-parietal lobes and cerebellum, and deactivated areas of the default mode  network (DMN). During the N-back load contrast, compared to HC, the three groups of  MS patients had a common pattern of decreased activation of the right superior  parietal lobule, left inferior parietal lobule and left middle frontal gyrus. Areas  specifically more active in CIS patients compared to the other study groups were  found in the left medial superior frontal gyrus and right anterior cingulate cortex,  whereas SPMS patients selectively activated the left parahippocampal gyrus and left  superior temporal pole (STP). Worse accuracy and global cognitive scores correlated  with increased STP activation. CONCLUSION: Load-dependent alterations of working  memory network recruitment occur in MS.

This preliminary study examined  fMRI data from a clinical trial implementing a 4-week virtual reality driving  intervention to assess how sustained training can improve deficits related to  traumatic brain injury. Previously-reported behavioral findings showed improvements  in working memory and processing speed in those who received the intervention; this  report explores the brain bases of these effects by comparing neural activity  related to working memory (n-back task) and resting state connectivity before and  after the intervention. In the baseline visit (n = 24), working memory activity was  prominent in bilateral DLPFC and prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, medial superior  frontal gyrus, left thalamus, bilateral supramarginal / angular gyrus, precuneus,  and left posterior middle temporal gyrus. Following intervention, participants  showed less global activation on the n-back task, with regions of activity only in  the bilateral middle frontal cortex, posterior middle frontal gyrus, and  supramarginal gyrus. Activity related to working memory load was reduced for the  group that went through the intervention (n = 7) compared to the waitlist control  group (n = 4). These results suggest that successful cognitive rehabilitation of  working memory in TBI may be associated with increased efficiency of brain networks,  evidenced by reduced activation of brain activity during cognitive processing.

Until  recently, there are few studies on generative models supporting classification and  prediction of neural systems compared to the description of the architecture.  However, the requirement of collapsing data spatially and temporally in the  state-of-the art methods to analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),  electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data cause loss of  important information. In this study, we addressed this issue using a topological  data analysis (TDA) method, called Mapper, which visualizes evolving patterns of  brain activity as a mathematical graph. Accordingly, we analyzed preprocessed MEG  data of 83 subjects from Human Connectome Project (HCP) collected during working  memory n-back task. We examined variation in the dynamics of the brain states with  the Mapper graphs, and to determine how this variation relates to measures such as  response time and performance. The application of the Mapper method to MEG data  detected a novel neuroimaging marker that explained the performance of the  participants along with the ground truth of response time. In addition, TDA enabled  us to distinguish two task-positive brain activations during 0-back and 2-back  tasks, which is hard to detect with the other pipelines that require collapsing the  data in the spatial and temporal domain. Further, the Mapper graphs of the  individuals also revealed one large group in the middle of the stimulus detecting  the high engagement in the brain with fine temporal resolution, which could  contribute to increase spatiotemporal resolution by merging different imaging  modalities. Hence, our work provides another evidence to the effectiveness of the  TDA methods for extracting subtle dynamic properties of high temporal resolution MEG  data without the temporal and spatial collapse.",2019-06-19,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,,NA,6,9,NA,Brain Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 31248185  PMCID: PMC6628086,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/F4ZCW6E8/Duman et al. - 2019 - Uncovering Dynamic Brain Reconfiguration in MEG Wo.pdf,NA,working memory; dynamic functional connectivity; mapper; MEG; topological data analysis,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Duman et al. - 2019 - Uncovering Dynamic Brain Reconfiguration in MEG Wo.pdf

Episodic memory is vital because it enables individuals to form and maintain their  self-identities. Our study analyzes the extent to which whole-brain functional  connectivity observed during completion of an N-back memory task, a common measure  of working memory, can predict both working memory and episodic memory. METHODS: We  used connectome-based predictive models (CPMs) to predict 502 Human Connectome  Project (HCP) participants' in-scanner 2-back memory test scores and out-of-scanner  working memory test (List Sorting) and episodic memory test (Picture Sequence and  Penn Word) scores based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data  collected both during rest and N-back task performance. We also analyzed the  functional brain connections that contributed to prediction for each of these  models. RESULTS: Functional connectivity observed during N-back task performance  predicted out-of-scanner List Sorting scores and to a lesser extent out-of-scanner  Picture Sequence scores, but did not predict out-of-scanner Penn Word scores.  Additionally, the functional connections predicting 2-back scores overlapped to a  greater degree with those predicting List Sorting scores than with those predicting  Picture Sequence or Penn Word scores. Functional connections with the insula,  including connections between insular and parietal regions, predicted scores across  the 2-back, List Sorting, and Picture Sequence tasks. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings  validate functional connectivity observed during the N-back task as a measure of  working memory, which generalizes to predict episodic memory to a lesser extent. By  building on our understanding of the predictive power of N-back task functional  connectivity, this work enhances our knowledge of relationships between working  memory and episodic memory.",Aug-21,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,e02105,NA,8,11,NA,Brain Behav,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,© 2021 The Authors.

We studied the association of emotional blunting, rumination with neural networks  dynamics in remitted depressed patients and cognitive performance during an N-Back  task. Twenty-six outpatients in remission of depression (Hamilton Depressive rating  scale score <7) performed an N-Back task during fMRI assessment. All patients had  been treated by paroxetine for a minimum of 4 months. Two subgroups of patients  [Nonemotionally blunted (NEB) = 14 and emotionally blunted (EB) = 12] were  determined. To identify functional network maps across participants, the Network  Detection using Independent Component Analysis approach was employed. Within and  between Task Positive Network (TPN) and Default Mode Network (DMN) connectivity were  assessed and related to variability of performance on the N-Back task and  rumination. EB and NEB patients were not different for the level of accurate  responses at the N-Back. However over the entire working memory task, the negative  correlation between DMN and TPN was significantly lower in the EB than NEB group and  was differently related to cognitive performance and rumination. The stronger the  negative correlation between DMN and TPN was, the less variable the reaction time  during 3-Back task in NEB patients. Moreover the greater the negative correlation  between DMN and TPN was, the lower the rumination score in EB patients. Emotional  blunting may be associated with compromised monitoring of rumination and cognitive  functioning in remitted depressed patients through altered cooperation between DMN  and TPN. The study suggests clinical remission in depression is associated with  biological heterogeneity.

This study investigated WM-related neural substrates of preserved and poor  insight in schizophrenia. METHOD: Forty stable schizophrenia outpatients, 20 with  preserved and 20 with poor insight (usable data obtained from 18 preserved and 14  poor insight patients), and 20 healthy participants underwent functional magnetic  resonance imaging (fMRI) during a parametric 'n-back' task. The three groups were  preselected to match on age, education and predicted IQ, and the two patient groups  to have distinct insight levels. Performance and fMRI data were analysed to  determine how groups of patients with preserved and poor insight differed from each  other, and from healthy participants. RESULTS: Poor insight patients showed lower  performance accuracy, relative to healthy participants (p=0.01) and preserved  insight patients (p=0.08); the two patient groups were comparable on symptoms and  medication. Preserved insight patients, relative to poor insight patients, showed  greater activity most consistently in the precuneus and cerebellum (both bilateral)  during WM; they also showed greater activity than healthy participants in the  inferior-superior frontal gyrus and cerebellum (bilateral). Group differences in  brain activity did not co-vary significantly with performance accuracy. CONCLUSIONS:  The precuneus and cerebellum function contribute to preserved insight in  schizophrenia. Preserved insight as well as normal-range WM capacity in  schizophrenia sub-groups may be achieved via compensatory neural activity in the  frontal cortex and cerebellum.",Jan-14,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,201-209,NA,1,152,NA,Schizophr Res,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The work of Don Stuss and others  has demonstrated that frontal and parietal cortices are crucial to cognitive  control, particularly in normal aging, which is characterized by reduced control  mechanisms. However, the structure-function relationships specific to each domain  and subsequent impact on performance are not well understood. In the current study,  we examined both age and individual differences in functional activity associated  with core domains of cognitive control in relation to fronto-parietal structure and  task performance. Participants (n = 140, aged 20-86 years) completed three fMRI  tasks: go/no-go (inhibition), task switching (shifting), and n-back (working  memory), in addition to structural and diffusion imaging. All three tasks engaged a  common set of fronto-parietal regions; however, the contributions of age, brain  structure, and task performance to functional activity were unique to each domain.  Aging was associated with differences in functional activity for all tasks, largely  in regions outside common fronto-parietal control regions. Shifting and inhibition  showed greater contributions of structure to overall decreases in brain activity,  suggesting that more intact fronto-parietal structure may serve as a scaffold for  efficient functional response. Working memory showed no contribution of structure to  functional activity but had strong effects of age and task performance. Together,  these results provide a comprehensive and novel examination of the joint  contributions of aging, performance, and brain structure to functional activity  across multiple domains of cognitive control.",2021-08-01,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,1811-1832,NA,9,33,NA,J Cogn Neurosci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,© 2021 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States PMID: 34375414,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/532B92P3/Rieck et al. - 2021 - Contributions of Brain Function and Structure to T.pdf,NA,"Humans; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Reaction Time; Brain/diagnostic imaging; *Memory, Short-Term; *Aging; Cognition",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rieck et al. - 2021 - Contributions of Brain Function and Structure to T.pdf

DLPFC dysfunction is related to  cognitive impairment. It has been suggested that dietary components and high-density  lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) play a vital role in brain health and cognitive  function. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the relationships between dietary  nutrient intake and lipid levels with functional MRI (fMRI) brain activation in  DLPFC among older adults with mild cognitive impairment. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A  total of 15 community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment, aged ≥60  years, participated in this cross-sectional study at selected senior citizen clubs  in Klang Valley, Malaysia. The 7-day recall Diet History Questionnaire was used to  assess participants' dietary nutrient intake. Fasting blood samples were also  collected for lipid profile assessment. All participants performed N-back (0- and  1-back) working memory tasks during fMRI scanning. DLPFC (Brodmann's areas 9 and 46,  and inferior, middle, and superior frontal gyrus) was identified as a region of  interest for analysis. RESULTS: Positive associations were observed between dietary  intake of energy, protein, cholesterol, vitamins B6 and B12, potassium, iron,  phosphorus, magnesium, and HDL-C with DLPFC activation (P<0.05). Multivariate  analysis showed that vitamin B6 intake, β=0.505, t (14)=3.29, P=0.023, and Digit  Symbol score, β=0.413, t (14)=2.89, P=0.045; R (2)=0.748, were positively related to  DLPFC activation.

Although hippocampus activity is  believed to be affected by socioeconomic status (SES), limited knowledge exists on  which SES indicators influence hippocampus function. Purpose: This study explored  the separate and combined effects of three SES indicators, namely parental  education, family income, and neighborhood income, on adolescents' hippocampus  activation during an N-Back memory task. As some of the effects of parental  education may be through income, we also tested if the effect of parental education  on hippocampus activation during our N-Back memory task is mediated by family or  neighborhood income. Methods: The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)  study is a national multi-center investigation of American adolescents' brain  development. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of a total sample of  3067 9-10-year-old adolescents were used. The primary outcome was left- hippocampus  activation during the N-Back memory task (mean beta weight for N-Back run 1 2 back  versus 0 back contrast in left hippocampus). The independent variable was parental  education. Family income and neighborhood income were two possible mediators. Age,  sex, and marital status were the covariates. To test mediation, we used hierarchical  linear regression models first without and then with our mediators. Full mediation  was defined according to Kenny. The Sobel test was used to confirm statistical  mediation. Results: In the absence of family and neighborhood income in the model,  higher parental educational attainment was associated with lower level of left  hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory task. This effect was significant  while age, sex, and marital status were controlled. The association between parental  educational attainment and hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory task was  no more significant when we controlled for family and neighborhood income. Instead,  family income was associated with hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory  task. These findings suggested that family income fully mediates the effect of  parental educational attainment on left hippocampus activation during the N-Back  memory task. Conclusions: The effect of parental educational attainment on  adolescents' hippocampus activation during an N-Back memory task is fully explained  by family income. That means low family income is why adolescents with low-educated  parents show highlighted hippocampus activation during an N-Back memory task. Given  the central role of the hippocampus in learning and memory and as income is a  modifiable factor by tax and economic policies, income-redistribution policies, fair  taxation, and higher minimum wage may have implications for promotion of adolescent  equality and social justice. There is a need to focus on family-level economic needs  across all levels of neighborhood income.",2020-08-05,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,,NA,8,10,NA,Brain Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 32764344  PMCID: PMC7464386,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/J9F3VL97/Assari et al. - 2020 - Family Income Mediates the Effect of Parental Educ.pdf,NA,adolescents; brain development; fMRI; socioeconomic factors; hippocampus,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Assari et al. - 2020 - Family Income Mediates the Effect of Parental Educ.pdf

Working memory is often  affected, along with attention, executive control, and cognitive processing speed.  Verbal working memory (VWM) requires the interaction of each of the cognitive  component processes along with a phonological loop for verbal repetition and  rehearsal. HIV-related functional brain response abnormalities during VWM are  evident in functional MRI (fMRI), though the neural substrate underlying these  neurocognitive deficits is not well understood. The current study addressed this by  comparing 24 HIV+ to 27 demographically matched HIV-seronegative (HIV-) adults with  respect to fMRI activation on a VWM paradigm (n-back) relative to performance on two  standardized tests of executive control, attention and processing speed (Stroop and  Trail Making A-B). As expected, the HIV+ group had deficits on these neurocognitive  tests compared to HIV- controls, and also differed in neural response on fMRI  relative to neuropsychological performance. Reduced activation in VWM task-related  brain regions on the 2-back was associated with Stroop interference deficits in HIV+  but not with either Trail Making A or B performance. Activation of the posterior  cingulate cortex (PCC) of the default mode network during rest was associated with  Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-2 (HVLT-2) learning in HIV+. These effects were not  observed in the HIV- controls. Reduced dynamic range of neural response was also  evident in HIV+ adults when activation on the 2-back condition was compared to the  extent of activation of the default mode network during periods of rest. Neural  dynamic range was associated with both Stroop and HVLT-2 performance. These findings  provide evidence that HIV-associated alterations in neural activation induced by VWM  demands and during rest differentially predict executive-attention and verbal  learning deficits. That the Stroop, but not Trail Making was associated with VWM  activation suggests that attentional regulation difficulties in suppressing  interference and/or conflict regulation are a component of working memory deficits  in HIV+ adults. Alterations in neural dynamic range may be a useful index of the  impact of HIV on functional brain response and as a fMRI metric in predicting  cognitive outcomes.",Jun-18,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,291-304,NA,3,24,NA,J Neurovirol,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 29280107  PMCID: PMC6022366,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/HNRCPLJQ/Cohen et al. - 2018 - Neural response to working memory demand predicts .pdf,NA,"Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Gyrus Cinguli/physiopathology; *Working memory; *Memory, Short-Term; *Cognition; Case-Control Studies; Attention; *Stroop; *Attention; *Executive control; *Executive Function; *Functional MRI; *HIV; *Verbal Learning; Cognitive Dysfunction/complications/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology; HIV Infections/complications/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Rest",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Cohen et al. - 2018 - Neural response to working memory demand predicts .pdf

However, the neural mechanism  underlying DMN deactivation remains elusive. As the coordination of regional  neurochemical substrates and interregional neural interactions are both essential in  support of brain functions, a quantitative description of how they impact DMN  deactivation may provide new insights into the mechanism. Using an n-back working  memory task fMRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we probed the pairwise  relationship between task-induced deactivation, interregional functional  connectivity and regional excitation-inhibition balance (evaluated by glutamate/GABA  ratio) in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCu). Task-induced PCC/PCu  deactivation correlated with its excitation-inhibition balance and interregional  functional connectivity, where participants with lower glutamate/GABA ratio,  stronger intra-DMN connections and stronger antagonistic DMN-SN (salience  network)/ECN (executive control network) inter-network connections had greater  PCC/PCu deactivation. Mediation analyses revealed that the DMN-SN functional  interactions partially mediated the relationship between task-induced deactivation  and the excitation-inhibition balance at the PCC/PCu. The triple-relationship  discovered in the present study has the potential to bridge DMN-deactivation related  findings from various neuroimaging modalities and may provide new insights into the  neural mechanism of DMN deactivation. Moreover, this finding may have significant  implications for neuropsychiatric disorders related to the DMN dysfunction and  suggests an integrated application of pharmacological and neuromodulation-based  strategies for rescuing DMN deactivation deficits.",2019-01-15,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,388-397,NA,,185,NA,Neuroimage,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,Published by Elsevier Inc.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 30359729  PMCID: PMC8284909,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/QDZF4KLG/Gu et al. - 2019 - Regional excitation-inhibition balance predicts de.pdf,NA,"Humans; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain Mapping/*methods; Brain/*physiology; *fMRI; Memory, Short-Term/physiology; *Default mode network; *Functional connectivity; Nerve Net/*physiology; *Magnetic resonance spectroscopy; *Task-based deactivation; Executive Function/physiology; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Gu et al. - 2019 - Regional excitation-inhibition balance predicts de.pdf

It remains unknown,  however, how the neural systems that support working memory are altered through  intensive training to enable the expansion of working memory capacity. We used fMRI  to measure plasticity in activations associated with complex working memory before  and after 20 days of training. Healthy young adults were randomly assigned to train  on either a dual n-back working memory task or a demanding visuospatial attention  task. Training resulted in substantial and task-specific expansion of dual n-back  abilities accompanied by changes in the relationship between working memory load and  activation. Training differentially affected activations in two large-scale  frontoparietal networks thought to underlie working memory: the executive control  network and the dorsal attention network. Activations in both networks linearly  scaled with working memory load before training, but training dissociated the role  of the two networks and eliminated this relationship in the executive control  network. Load-dependent functional connectivity both within and between these two  networks increased following training, and the magnitudes of increased connectivity  were positively correlated with improvements in task performance.

We found decreased behavioral performance with increasing load and decreasing visual  resolution, but the neurobiological mechanisms involved differed between the two  manipulations and did so for both groups. Importantly, while the load manipulation  was, as predicted, accompanied by activation in the frontoparietal working memory  network, the resolution manipulation resulted in temporal and occipital activation.

Despite widespread  use, the clinical utility of these tasks is not well specified. This study compared  N-back performance during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with task  data acquired outside of the scanner as a measure of reliability across environment.  N-back task validity was examined in relation to performance and rater-based  measures used clinically to assess working memory. METHOD: Forty-three healthy  adults completed verbal and object N-back tasks during fMRI scanning and outside the  scanner. Task difficulty was varied parametrically (0, 1, and 2-back conditions).  Order of N-back task completion was stratified by modality (verbal/object) and  environment. Participants completed the Digit Span (DS) and provided self-ratings  using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF-WM). RESULTS: Mean  verbal and object N-back accuracy was above 95% across load conditions; task  difficulty was effectively manipulated across load conditions. Performance accuracy  did not significantly differ by environment. N-back reaction time was slower during  fMRI (F = 6.52, p = .01, ηp(2) = .13); participants were faster when initially  completing tasks outside the scanner (ηp(2) = .10-.15). Verbal 2-back accuracy was  significantly related to DS performance (r = .36, p = .02). N-back performance was  not related to BRIEF-WM. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence for reliability  of N-back accuracy during fMRI scanning; however, reliability of reaction time data  is affected by order of task presentation.

Working-memory may therefore be a powerful predictor of the course of  drug use, but chronic substance use may also impair working-memory. The aim of this  3-year longitudinal neuro-imaging study was to investigate the relationship between  substance use (e.g. alcohol, cannabis, nicotine, illegal psychotropic drugs) and  working-memory network function over time in heavy cannabis users and controls.  Forty-nine participants performed an n-back working-memory task at baseline and at  3-year follow-up. At follow-up, there were 22 current heavy cannabis users, 4  abstinent heavy cannabis users and 23 non-cannabis-using controls.  Tensor-independent component analysis (Tensor-ICA) was used to investigate  individual differences in working-memory network functionality over time. Within the  group of cannabis users, cannabis-related problems remained stable, whereas  alcohol-related problems, nicotine dependence and illegal psychotropic substance use  increased over time. At both measurements, behavioral performance and network  functionality during the n-back task did not differ between heavy cannabis users and  controls. Although n-back accuracy improved, working-memory network function  remained stable over time.

In the current study, 167 adolescents and young  adults (aged 13-24 years) with different amounts of gaming experience performed an  n-back working memory task with vowels, with the sensory modality of the vowel  stream switching between audition and vision at random intervals. We studied the  relationship between self-reported daily gaming activity, working memory (n-back)  task performance and related brain activity measured using functional magnetic  resonance imaging (fMRI). The results revealed that the extent of daily gaming  activity was related to enhancements in both performance accuracy and speed during  the most demanding (2-back) level of the working memory task. This improved working  memory performance was accompanied by enhanced recruitment of a fronto-parietal  cortical network, especially the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In contrast, during  the less demanding (1-back) level of the task, gaming was associated with decreased  activity in the same cortical regions. Our results suggest that a greater degree of  daily gaming experience is associated with better working memory functioning and  task difficulty-dependent modulation in fronto-parietal brain activity already in  adolescence and even when non-expert gamers are studied.

Here, we used an n-back task (Experiment 1) and an adaptation paradigm (Experiment  2) to distinguish memory-related activity from that associated with goal-directed  action. In Experiment 1, participants indicated, in separate blocks of trials,  whether the incoming stimulus was presented at the same location as in the previous  trial (1-back) or two trials ago (2-back). Prior to a block of trials, participants  were told to use their left or right index finger. Accuracy and reaction times were  worse for the 2-back than for the 1-back condition. The analysis of functional  magnetic resonance imaging data revealed greater sustained task-related activity in  the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and superior frontal sulcus during 2-back than  1-back after accounting for response-related activity elicited by the targets.  Target detection and response execution were also associated with enhanced activity  in the IPL bilaterally, though the activation was anterior to that associated with  sustained task-related activity. In Experiment 2, we used an event-related design in  which participants listened (no response required) to trials that comprised four  sounds presented either at the same location or at four different locations. We  found larger IPL activation for changes in sound location than for sounds presented  at the same location.

We studied the association between a  schizophrenia risk locus involving a 6.1Mb homozygous region on chromosome 13q22-31  in a consanguineous multiplex family and cognitive functioning, haemodynamic  response and white matter integrity using neuroimaging. METHODS: We performed CANTAB  neuropsychological testing on four affected family members (all homozygous for the  risk locus), ten unaffected family members (seven homozygous and three heterozygous)  and ten healthy volunteers, and tested neuronal responses on fMRI during an n-back  working memory task, and white matter integrity on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) on  four affected and six unaffected family members (four homozygous and two  heterozygous) and three healthy volunteers.

OBJECTIVE: To map anhedonia in children onto changes in intrinsic  large-scale connectivity and task-evoked activation and to probe the specificity of  these changes in anhedonia against other clinical phenotypes (low mood, anxiety, and  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were from the first annual release  of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, collected between September  2016 and September 2017 and analyzed between April and September 2018.  Cross-sectional data of children aged 9 to 10 years from unreferred, community  samples during rest (n = 2878) and during reward anticipation (n = 2874) and working  memory (n = 2745) were analyzed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Alterations in fMRI  data during rest, reward anticipation, and working memory were examined, using both  frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Functional MRI connectivity within large-scale  networks, between networks, and between networks and subcortical regions were  examined during rest. Functional MRI activation were examined during reward  anticipation and working memory using the monetary incentive delayed and N-back  tasks, respectively. RESULTS: Among 2878 children with adequate-quality  resting-state fMRI data (mean [SD] age, 10.03 [0.62] years; 1400 girls [48.6%]),  children with anhedonia (261 [9.1%]), compared with those without anhedonia (2617  [90.9%]), showed hypoconnectivity among various large-scale networks and subcortical  regions, including between the arousal-related cingulo-opercular network and  reward-related ventral striatum area (mean [SD] with anhedonia, 0.08 [0.10] vs  without anhedonia, 0.10 [0.10]; t2,876 = 3.33; P < .001; q[false discovery  rate] = 0.03; ln[Bayes factor10] = 2.85). Such hypoconnectivity did not manifest  among children with low mood (277 of 2878 [9.62%]), anxiety (109 of 2878 [3.79%]),  or ADHD (459 of 2878 [15.95%]), suggesting specificity. Similarly, among 2874  children (mean [SD] age, 10.03 [0.62] years; 1414 girls [49.2%]) with high-quality  task-evoked fMRI data, children with anhedonia (248 of 2874 [8.63%]) demonstrated  hypoactivation during reward anticipation in various areas, including the dorsal  striatum and areas of the cingulo-opercular network. This hypoactivity was not found  among children with low mood (268 of 2874 [9.32%]), anxiety (90 of 2874 [3.13%]), or  ADHD (473 of 2874 [16.46%]). Moreover, we also found context- and phenotype-specific  double dissociations; while children with anhedonia showed altered activation during  reward anticipation (but not working memory), those with ADHD showed altered  activation during working memory (but not reward anticipation). CONCLUSIONS AND  RELEVANCE: Using the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study data set,  phenotype-specific alterations were found in intrinsic large-scale connectivity and  task-evoked activation in children with anhedonia. The hypoconnectivity at rest and  hypoactivation during reward anticipation complementarily map anhedonia onto  aberrations in neural-cognitive processes: lack of intrinsic reward-arousal  integration during rest and diminishment of extrinsic reward-arousal activity during  reward anticipation. These findings help delineate the pathophysiological  underpinnings of anhedonia in children.",2019-06-01,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,624-633,NA,6,76,NA,JAMA Psychiatry,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 30865236  PMCID: PMC6552295,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/AKMRQZK2/Pornpattananangkul et al. - 2019 - Association Between Childhood Anhedonia and Altera.pdf,NA,"Humans; Female; Male; Child; Brain Mapping; Cognition/physiology; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Brain/*diagnostic imaging; Cross-Sectional Studies; Functional Neuroimaging; Anhedonia/*physiology; Anticipation, Psychological/*physiology; Nerve Net/*diagnostic imaging; Reward",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Pornpattananangkul et al. - 2019 - Association Between Childhood Anhedonia and Altera.pdf

This study aimed to test  three hypotheses in older adults. First, that the brain activation pattern  associated to WM processes in elderly during successful low load tasks is located in  posterior sensory and associative areas; second, that the prefrontal and parietal  cortex and basal ganglia should be more active during high-demand tasks; third, that  cerebellar activations are related to high-demand cognitive tasks and have a  specific lateralization depending on the condition. METHODS: We used a  neuropsychological assessment with functional magnetic resonance imaging and a core  N-back paradigm design that was maintained across the combination of four conditions  of stimuli and two memory loads in a sample of twenty elderly subjects. RESULTS:  During low-loads, activations were located in the visual ventral network. In high  loads, there was an involvement of the basal ganglia and cerebellum in addition to  the frontal and parietal cortices. Moreover, we detected an executive control role  of the cerebellum in a relatively symmetric fronto-parietal network. Nevertheless,  this network showed a predominantly left lateralization in parietal regions  associated presumably with an overuse of verbal storage strategies. The differential  activations between conditions were stimuli-dependent and were located in sensory  areas.

The work of Don Stuss and others  has demonstrated that frontal and parietal cortices are crucial to cognitive  control, particularly in normal aging, which is characterized by reduced control  mechanisms. However, the structure-function relationships specific to each domain  and subsequent impact on performance are not well understood. In the current study,  we examined both age and individual differences in functional activity associated  with core domains of cognitive control in relation to fronto-parietal structure and  task performance. Participants (N = 140, aged 20-86 years) completed three fMRI  tasks: go/no-go (inhibition), task switching (shifting), and n-back (working  memory), in addition to structural and diffusion imaging. All three tasks engaged a  common set of fronto-parietal regions; however, the contributions of age, brain  structure, and task performance to functional activity were unique to each domain.  Aging was associated with differences in functional activity for all tasks, largely  in regions outside common fronto-parietal control regions. Shifting and inhibition  showed greater contributions of structure to overall decreases in brain activity,  suggesting that more intact fronto-parietal structure may serve as a scaffold for  efficient functional response. Working memory showed no contribution of structure to  functional activity but had strong effects of age and task performance.

The present study merged clinical neuropsychology  and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the construct validity  of the letter variant of the n-back task (LNB) and to further identify the  task-evoked networks involved in WM. Construct validity of the LNB task was  investigated using a bootstrapping approach to correlate LNB task performance across  clinically validated neuropsychological measures of WM to establish convergent  validity, as well as measures of related but distinct cognitive constructs (i.e.,  attention and short-term memory) to establish discriminant validity. Independent  component analysis (ICA) identified brain networks active during the LNB task in 34  healthy control participants, and general linear modeling determined  task-relatedness of these networks. Bootstrap correlation analyses revealed moderate  to high correlations among measures expected to converge with LNB (|ρ|≥ 0.37) and  weak correlations among measures expected to discriminate (|ρ|≤ 0.29), controlling  for age and education. ICA identified 35 independent networks, 17 of which  demonstrated engagement significantly related to task condition, controlling for  reaction time variability.

It continues to be produced after menopause and provides  estrogenicity after depletion of ovarian hormones. Estradiol depletion contributes  to memory circuitry changes over menopause, including changes in hippocampal (HIPP)  and dorsolateral- and ventrolateral-prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; VLPFC) function.  Further, major depressive disorder (MDD) patients have, in general, lower levels of  estradiol and lower DHEAS than healthy controls, thus potentially a higher risk of  adverse menopausal outcomes. We investigated whether higher DHEAS levels after  menopause is associated with better memory circuitry function, especially in women  with MDD. 212 adults (ages 45-55, 50% women) underwent clinical and fMRI testing.  Participants performed a working memory (WM) N-back task and an episodic memory  verbal encoding (VE) task during fMRI scanning. DHEAS levels were significantly  associated with memory circuitry function, specifically in MDD postmenopausal women.  On the WM task, lower DHEAS levels were associated with increased HIPP activity. On  the VE task, lower DHEAS levels were associated with decreased activity in the HIPP  and VLPFC. In contrast, there was no association between DHEAS levels and memory  circuitry function in MDD pre/perimenopausal women, men, and non-MDD participants  regardless of sex and reproductive status. In fact, MDD postmenopausal women with  higher levels of DHEAS were similar to MDD pre/perimenopausal women and men. Thus,  memory circuitry deficits associated with MDD and a lower ability of the adrenal  gland to produce DHEAS after menopause may contribute to a lower ability to maintain  intact memory function with age.",2019-10-15,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,146303,NA,,1721,NA,Brain Res,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We evaluated effective connectivity under an N-back working memory  task in 24 participants using stochastic dynamic causal modelling (DCM) of 7 T fMRI  data. We repeated the analysis using resting-state data, from the same subjects, to  model connectivity among the same brain regions engaged by the N-back task. This  allowed us to: (i) examine the relationship between intrinsic (task-independent)  effective connectivity during resting (A(rest)) and task states (A(task)), (ii)  cluster phenotypes of task-related changes in effective connectivity (B(task))  across participants, (iii) identify edges (B(task)) showing high inter-individual  effective connectivity differences and (iv) associate reaction times with the  similarity between B(task) and A(rest) in these edges. We found a strong correlation  between A(rest) and A(task) over subjects but a marked difference between B(task)  and A(rest). We further observed a strong clustering of individuals in terms of  B(task), which was not apparent in A(rest). The task-related effective connectivity  B(task) varied highly in the edges from the parietal to the frontal lobes across  individuals, so the three groups were clustered mainly by the effective connectivity  within these networks. The similarity between B(task) and A(rest) at the edges from  the parietal to the frontal lobes was positively correlated with 2-back reaction  times. This result implies that a greater change in context-sensitive coupling -  from resting-state connectivity - is associated with faster reaction times.

Traditionally, techniques such as PCA and ICA, which rely on strong  non-physiological assumptions such as orthogonality and statistical independence,  have been used for this purpose. Recently, tensor decomposition techniques such as  parallel factor analysis have gained more popularity in neuroimaging applications as  they are able to inherently contain the multidimensionality of neuroimaging data and  achieve uniqueness in decomposition without making strong assumptions. Previously,  the coupled matrix-tensor decomposition (CMTD) has been applied for the fusion of  the EEG and fMRI. Only recently the coupled tensor-tensor decomposition (CTTD) has  been proposed. Here for the first time, we propose the use of CTTD of a 4th order  EEG tensor (space, time, frequency, and participant) and 3rd order fMRI tensor  (space, time, participant), coupled partially in time and participant domains, for  the extraction of the task related features in both modalities. We used both the  sensor-level and source-level EEG for the coupling. The phase shifted paradigm  signals were incorporated as the temporal initializers of the CTTD to extract the  task related features. The validation of the approach is demonstrated on  simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings from six participants performing an N-Back memory  task. The EEG and fMRI tensors were coupled in 9 components out of which seven  components had a high correlation (more than 0.85) with the task.

However, previous  behavioural results are discrepant as are the few functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI) results collected in adults and adolescents with ASD. Here we  investigate the precise temporal dynamics of WM-related brain activity using  magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 20 children with ASD and matched controls during an  n-back WM task across different load levels (1-back vs 2-back). Although behavioural  results were similar between ASD and typically developing (TD) children, the  between-group comparison performed on functional brain activity showed atypical  WM-related brain processes in children with ASD compared with TD children. These  atypical responses were observed in the ASD group from 200 to 600 ms post stimulus  in both the low- (1-back) and high- (2-back) memory load conditions. During the  1-back condition, children with ASD showed reduced WM-related activations in the  right hippocampus and the cingulate gyrus compared with TD children who showed more  activation in the left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex and the insulae. In the  2-back condition, children with ASD showed less activity in the left insula and  midcingulate gyrus and more activity in the left precuneus than TD children. In  addition, reduced activity in the anterior cingulate cortex was correlated with  symptom severity in children with ASD. Thus, this MEG study identified the precise  timing and sources of atypical WM-related activity in frontal, temporal and parietal  regions in children with ASD.

The functional integration perspective further  suggests that working memory performance also modulates differences in functional  interactions of the DLPFC between patients and controls. To explore this  possibility, 45 healthy controls and 45 patients with schizophrenia were recruited  to perform a 2-back task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Each  group was further divided into two subgroups based on task performance to examine  the modulatory effect of performance on functional interactions of the DLPFC, as  measured via psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses. We observed that, in  patients with schizophrenia who exhibited impaired working memory capacity and  decreased brain activation/deactivation, functional interactions between the  right/left DLPFC and angular cortex were decreased relative to those of healthy  controls. Furthermore, we observed an interaction effect of working memory  performance and diagnosis on functional connectivity between the right/left DLPFC  seed region and posterior regions such as the angular cortex, fusiform gyrus, and  middle occipital gyrus. This interaction effect was mainly driven by the negative  correlation between functional connectivity and performance in healthy controls, and  by the positive correlation in patients with schizophrenia. These results  demonstrate the effects of inter-individual differences in working memory  performance on functional interactions between the DLPFC and posterior regions in  patients with schizophrenia as well as healthy controls, which may shed new light on  the neural basis of working memory.",2017,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,56,NA,,8,NA,Front Psychol,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 28289394  PMCID: PMC5326798,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/BSBR8B4T/Wu et al. - 2017 - Task Performance Modulates Functional Connectivity.pdf,NA,schizophrenia; fMRI; N-back; fusiform gyrus; inferior parietal lobule (IPL); middle frontal gyrus; psychophysiological interaction (PPI),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Wu et al. - 2017 - Task Performance Modulates Functional Connectivity.pdf

The participants with autism also  showed activation in a somewhat different location in the fusiform area than the  control participants. These results suggest that the neural circuitry of the brain  for face processing in autism may be analyzing the features of the face more as  objects and less in terms of their human significance. The functional connectivity  results revealed that the abnormal fusiform activation was embedded in a larger  context of smaller and less synchronized networks, particularly indicating lower  functional connectivity with frontal areas. In contrast to the underconnectivity  with frontal areas, the autism group showed no underconnectivity among posterior  cortical regions.

Auditory distraction is a frequently cited symptom in adults with attention deficit  hyperactivity disorder (aADHD)-yet few task-based fMRI studies have explored whether  deficits in cognitive control (associated with the disorder) impedes on the ability  to suppress/compensate for exogenously evoked cortical responses to noise in this  population. In the current study, we explored the effects of auditory distraction as  function of working memory (WM) load. Participants completed two tasks: an auditory  target detection (ATD) task in which the goal was to actively detect salient oddball  tones amidst a stream of standard tones in noise, and a visual n-back task  consisting of 0-, 1-, and 2-back WM conditions whilst concurrently ignoring the same  tonal signal from the ATD task. Results indicated that our sample of young aADHD (n  = 17), compared to typically developed controls (n = 17), had difficulty attenuating  auditory cortical responses to the task-irrelevant sound when WM demands were high  (2-back). Heightened auditory activity to task-irrelevant sound was associated with  both poorer WM performance and symptomatic inattentiveness. In the ATD task, we  observed a significant increase in functional communications between auditory and  salience networks in aADHD. Because performance outcomes were on par with controls  for this task, we suggest that this increased functional connectivity in aADHD was  likely an adaptive mechanism for suboptimal listening conditions. Taken together,  our results indicate that aADHD are more susceptible to noise interference when they  are engaged in a primary task. The ability to cope with auditory distraction appears  to be related to the WM demands of the task and thus the capacity to deploy  cognitive control.",2021,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,771711,NA,,15,NA,Front Hum Neurosci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,"Copyright © 2021 Blomberg, Johansson Capusan, Signoret, Danielsson and Rönnberg.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 34916918  PMCID: PMC8670091,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/B2JKPFWR/Blomberg et al. - 2021 - The Effects of Working Memory Load on Auditory Dis.pdf,NA,working memory; task-based fMRI; attention; adults; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; auditory distraction; cognitive control; salience network (SN),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Blomberg et al. - 2021 - The Effects of Working Memory Load on Auditory Dis.pdf

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Functional magnetic  resonance imaging was conducted on 17 children with TLE and 18 healthy control  participants (age 8-16 years) while they performed the N-back task in order to  assess activation of the executive control network. N-back accuracy, N-back reaction  time, and traditional neuropsychological tests (Delis-Kaplan Executive Function  System [D-KEFS] color-word interference and card-sort test) were also assessed.  PRINCIPAL OBSERVATIONS: Children with TLE exhibited executive dysfunction on D-KEFS  testing, reduced N-back accuracy, and increased N-back reaction time compared with  healthy controls; D-KEFS and N-back behavioral findings were significantly  correlated. Children with TLE also exhibited significant reduction in activation of  the frontal lobe within the executive control network compared to healthy controls.  These alterations were significantly correlated with N-back behavioral findings and  D-KEFS testing. CONCLUSIONS: Children with TLE exhibit executive dysfunction, which  correlates with executive control network alterations. This lends validity to the  theory that the executive control network contributes to working memory function.  The findings also indicate that children with TLE have network alterations in  nontemporal brain regions.",Sep-18,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,145-152,NA,,86,NA,Epilepsy Behav,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Changes arising in the  fMRI signal are analyzed post-hoc to elucidate the spatial and temporal activation  of brain regions associated with the tasks performed. The advent of real-time fMRI  has enabled a new method to systematically alter brain activity across space and  time using neurofeedback training (NFT), providing a new tool to study  internally-driven processes such as neuroplasticity. In this work, we combined  n-back practice with fMRI-NFT of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to  better understand the relationship between open- and closed-loop neuromodulation.  FMRI data were acquired during both traditional n-back and NFT across five imaging  sessions. Region-of-interest (ROI) and voxel-wise 2 × 2 within subjects ANOVAs were  carried out to determine the effects of, and interaction between, training session  and neuromodulation type. A main effect of training session was identified for only  a single, highly focused cluster that shared spatial properties with the fMRI-NFT  target region (left DLPFC). This finding indicates that combined open- and  closed-loop neuroplastic enhancement techniques result in focal changes that are  confined to the target area of NFT, and do not affect up- or down-stream network  components that are normally engaged during working memory. Additionally, we  identified a main effect of neuromodulation type for 15 clusters with significantly  different activation between open- and closed-loop neuromodulation during training,  12 of which demonstrated higher activity during the open-loop neuromodulation. Our  results, taken together with previous reports, indicate that fMRI-NFT combined with  n-back practice leads to a highly focal volume exhibiting neuroplasticity without  additional network effects.",2016,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,138,NA,,10,NA,Front Behav Neurosci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 27445733  PMCID: PMC4923251,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/PUSQUDNI/Sherwood et al. - 2016 - Combining Real-Time fMRI Neurofeedback Training of.pdf,NA,fMRI; n-back; DLPFC; neurofeedback; neuromodulation; plasticity,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Sherwood et al. - 2016 - Combining Real-Time fMRI Neurofeedback Training of.pdf

Recent drug development  has targeted enhanced NMDA function by increasing mGluR2/3 signaling. However, the  clinical utility of such agents remains uncertain, and markers of brain circuit  function are critical for clarifying mechanisms and understanding individual  differences in efficacy. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized  cross-over (14 day washout) pilot study evaluating adjunctive use of the mGluR2  positive allosteric modulator AZD8529 (80 mg daily for 3 days), in chronic stable  patients with schizophrenia (n = 26 analyzed). We focused on 3 T fMRI response in  frontostriatal regions during an n-back working memory task, testing the hypothesis  that AZD8529 produces fMRI changes that correlate with improvement in negative  symptoms and cognition. We found that AZD8529 did not produce significant  group-average effects on symptoms or cognitive accuracy. However, AZD8529 did  increase n-back fMRI activation in striatum (p < 0.0001) and anterior  cingulate/paracingulate (p = 0.002). Greater drug-versus-placebo effects on caudate  activation significantly correlated with greater reductions in PANSS negative  symptom scores (r = -0.42, p = 0.031), and exploratory correlations suggested  broader effects across multiple symptom domains and regions of interest. These  findings demonstrate that fMRI responses to mGluR2 positive modulation relate to  individual differences in symptom reduction, and could be pursued for future  biomarker development. Negative clinical results at the group level should not lead  to premature termination of investigation of this mechanism, which may benefit an  important subset of individuals with schizophrenia.

The characteristics of cognitive impairment in PD are  executive function (including working memory) and visuo-perceptual processing. The  visuospatial n-back test has the merit of minimizing the influence of educational  biases involved in the verbal n-back test. Furthermore, it can assess both  visuospatial recognition and working memory in a single test. METHODS: We aimed to  clarify the advantage of the visuospatial n-back test as a tool for detecting  impairments of working memory in PD. We enrolled 28 right-handed patients with PD  (18 males, 10 females) and 12 age-matched healthy controls (HC; 7 males, 5 females).  Thirteen patients were classified as MCI (PD-MCI), and 15 as cognitively normal PD  (PD-CN). Using functional MRI (fMRI), we explored the specific brain regions  associated with the performance of the n-back test in the PD-MCI, PD-CN, and HC  groups. The 0-back test assesses visuospatial recognition, while the 1-back and  2-back tests assess visuospatial working memory. Group comparisons were performed  for three loads of this test. RESULTS: Patients with PD performed significantly  worse in terms of the correct answer rates of all n-back tests compared with HC.  fMRI analyses performed during the 2-back test revealed reduced activation in the  bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and parietal  lobule in the PD group compared with the HC group. In contrast, the fMRI result  during the 0-back test showed only a marginal difference in the frontal lobe. On  comparisons of task performance between the PD-MCI and PD-CN groups, we found that  the correct answer rate in the 2-back test was lower in the PD-MCI group than in the  PD-CN group. However, scores of the 0-back and 1-back tests were not significantly  different between the two groups. The fMRI findings revealed that activations within  the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) during the 2-back  test were reduced in the patients with PD-MCI when compared to those with PD-CN.  CONCLUSIONS: This study reports reduced activation of the MFG and IPL in patients  with PD-MCI. These regions may be associated with the pathophysiology of working  memory impairment in patients with PD, which involves fronto-striatal network  dysfunction.",2021-09-03,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,335,NA,1,21,NA,BMC Neurol,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,© 2021.

However, there exists no treatment with replicated and  robust efficacy on cognition in BD. This is partially due to limited insight into  the neuronal underpinnings of cognitive impairment in these patients. This is the  first study to investigate neuronal underpinnings of cognitive impairment in a large  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset comparing neural activity  patterns between distinct neurocognitive subgroups of partially or fully remitted  patients with BD. METHODS: Patients (n = 153) and healthy controls (HC) (n = 52)  underwent neuropsychological assessment and fMRI, during which they performed a  verbal N-back working memory (WM) task. Based on hierarchical cluster analysis of  neuropsychological test performance, patients were grouped into one of two  neurocognitive subgroups (cognitively impaired, n = 91; cognitively normal compared  to HC, n = 62) that were compared on WM-related neural activity. RESULTS:  Cognitively impaired patients displayed WM-related hypo-activity in left  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and frontal and parietal regions within a cognitive  control network (CCN) as well as hyper-activity in the default mode network (DMN)  compared to cognitively normal patients. In contrast, cognitively normal patients  only exhibited hypo-activity within a small cluster in the superior frontal gyrus  relative to HC. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairment in BD seems to originate from a  failure to recruit key regions in the CCN and to suppress task-irrelevant DMN  activity during cognitive performance. These results highlight modulation of  aberrant dorsal prefrontal and DMN activity as a putative target for pro-cognitive  treatment in BD.",Feb-22,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,69-81,NA,1,24,NA,Bipolar Disord,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,© 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, nonlinear  (inverted-U-shaped) associations between neuronal activity and task difficulty can  lead to misinterpretation of group differences between patients and healthy  comparison subjects (HCs). In this paper, we evaluated a novel method for correcting  these misinterpretations based on conditional performance analysis. METHOD:  Participants included 25 HCs and 27 SZs who performed a working memory (WM) task  (N-back) with 5 load conditions while undergoing fMRI. Neuronal activity was  regressed onto: 1) task load (i.e., parametric task levels), 2) marginal task  performance (i.e., performance averaged over all load conditions), or 3) conditional  task performance (i.e., performance within each load condition). RESULTS: In most  regions of interest, conditional performance analysis uniquely revealed  inverted-U-shaped neuronal activity in both SZs and HCs. After accounting for  conditional performance differences between groups, we observed few difference in  both the pattern and level of neuronal activity between SZs and HCs within regions  that are classically associated with WM functioning (e.g., posterior dorsolateral  prefrontal and parietal association cortices). However, SZs did show aberrant  activity within the anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS:  Interpretations of differences in neuronal activity between groups, and of  associations between neuronal activity and performance, should be considered within  the context of task performance. Whether conditional performance-based differences  reflect compensation, dedifferentiation, or other processes is not a question that  is easily resolved by examining activation and performance data alone.",2021-05-05,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,12-Jan,NA,,,NA,J Int Neuropsychol Soc,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 33949299  PMCID: PMC8568731,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/SFIGXVH3/Thomas et al. - 2021 - Detecting the Inverted-U in fMRI Studies of Schizo.pdf,NA,Neuroimaging; Schizophrenia; Psychometrics; Confounds; Working Memory,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Thomas et al. - 2021 - Detecting the Inverted-U in fMRI Studies of Schizo.pdf

The  conclusions that can be drawn from these studies are not clear cut but suggest that  even though gender differences might not be apparent from behavioural measures, the  underlying neural substrate associated with working memory might be different in men  and women. Previous research suggests activation in a network of frontal and  parietal regions during working memory tasks. This study aimed to investigate gender  differences in patterns of brain activation during a verbal version of the N-back  working memory task, which incorporates the effects of increased demands on working  memory.

METHODS: Sixteen patients with SCH before and after being  treated with levothyroxine (LT4) for 6 months and 16 matched euthyroid subjects were  scanned by fMRI under the n-back task. RESULTS: The fMRI scan found that a neural  network consisting of bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), bilateral  premotor area (PreMA), supplementary motor area/anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral  parietal lobe (PA) and right caudate nucleus/thalamus was activated, with right  hemisphere dominance. In euthyroid subjects, all these regions of interest (ROIs)  showed load effect; however, only left DLPFC, left PA, bilateral PreMA and right  caudate nucleus/thalamus showed the same effect in Pre-SCH patients. Furthermore,  activation intensities of most ROIs (especially DLPFC and right PA) for Pre-SCH  patients were lower than those in the euthyroid subjects (F <3.046, p > 0.062).  Importantly, after a 6-month treatment with LT4, the load effect in SCH patients  appeared the same as in the euthyroid subjects in all the ROIs (F >13.176, p <  0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our previous study shows that verbal working memory of SCH  patients is impaired with abnormal activity in bilateral frontal areas. In this  study, the results indicated that SCH patients may also have spatial working memory  impairments, and the altered activities of right DLPFC and right posterior parietal  lobe may be one of the underlying neural mechanisms. Most importantly, this study  shows that LT4 replacement therapy can improve the memory impairment and reverse the  altered neural activity network.",2013,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,260-270,NA,3,97,NA,Neuroendocrinology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,"Copyright © 2012 S.

Thirty  mTBI patients were examined during the chronic stage of injury and compared to 28  control participants. Demographics and behavioral performance were matched across  groups. Due to the diffuse nature of injury, we hypothesized that there would be an  imbalance in the communication between task-positive and Default Mode Network (DMN)  regions in the context of effortful task execution. Specifically, a graph-theoretic  measure of modularity was used to quantify the extent to which groups of brain  regions tended to segregate into task-positive and DMN sub-networks.

Functional MRI (fMRI) studies demonstrate that  working memory involves a bilateral frontoparietal network the activation of which  is disrupted in hippocampal sclerosis (HS). A specific role of the hippocampus to  deactivate during working memory has been proposed with this mechanism faulty in  patients with HS. Structural correlates of disrupted working memory in HS have not  been explored. METHODS: We studied 54 individuals with medically refractory TLE and  unilateral HS (29 left) and 28 healthy controls. Subjects underwent 3T structural  MRI, a visuospatial n-back fMRI paradigm and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Working  memory capacity assessed by three span tasks (digit span backwards, gesture span,  motor sequences) was combined with performance in the visuospatial paradigm to give  a global working memory measure. Gray and white matter changes were investigated  using voxel-based morphometry and voxel-based analysis of DTI, respectively. KEY  FINDINGS: Individuals with left or right HS performed less well than healthy  controls on all measures of working memory. fMRI demonstrated a bilateral  frontoparietal network during the working memory task with reduced activation of the  right parietal lobe in both patient groups. In left HS, gray matter loss was seen in  the ipsilateral hippocampus and parietal lobe, with maintenance of the gray matter  volume of the contralateral parietal lobe associated with better performance. White  matter integrity within the frontoparietal network, in particular the superior  longitudinal fasciculus and cingulum, and the contralateral temporal lobe, was  associated with working memory performance. In right HS, gray matter loss was also  seen in the ipsilateral hippocampus and parietal lobe. Working memory performance  correlated with the gray matter volume of both frontal lobes and white matter  integrity within the frontoparietal network and contralateral temporal lobe.  SIGNIFICANCE: Our data provide further evidence that working memory is disrupted in  HS and impaired integrity of both gray and white matter is seen in functionally  relevant areas. We suggest this forms the structural basis of the impairment of  working memory, indicating widespread and functionally significant structural  changes in patients with apparently isolated HS.",Jul-13,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,1143-1153,NA,7,54,NA,Epilepsia,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,"Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2013 International League Against Epilepsy.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 23614459  PMCID: PMC3806272,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/6K3BSSNM/Winston et al. - 2013 - Structural correlates of impaired working memory i.pdf,NA,"Humans; Adolescent; Adult; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; *Brain Mapping; Working memory; Functional Laterality; Memory Disorders/*etiology; Oxygen; Diffusion tensor imaging; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe/*complications; Hippocampal sclerosis; Hippocampus/blood supply/*pathology; Parietal Lobe/blood supply/pathology; Sclerosis/etiology; Temporal lobe epilepsy; Voxel-based morphometry",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Winston et al. - 2013 - Structural correlates of impaired working memory i.pdf

The aim of this  explorative study was to investigate sex-dependent differences in prefrontal cortex  (PFC) functioning during a working memory (WM) functional magnetic resonance imaging  (fMRI) task in regular cocaine users (CUs), as PFC deficits are implicated in the  shift from recreational cocaine use to CUD. Neural activation was measured using  fMRI during a standard WM task (n-back task) in 27 male and 28 female CUs and in 26  male and 28 female non-cocaine users (non-CUs). Although there were no main or  interaction effects of sex and group on n-back task performance, WM-related  (2-back > 0-back) PFC functioning was significantly moderated by sex and group:  female compared with male CUs displayed higher WM-related activation of the middle  frontal gyrus (MFG), whereas female compared with male non-CUs displayed lower  WM-related MFG activation. Additionally, WM-related activation of the inferior  frontal gyrus, insula, and putamen was negatively associated with cocaine use  severity in female but not male CUs. These data support the hypothesis of  sex-dependent PFC differences in CUs and speculatively suggest that PFC deficits may  be more strongly implicated in the development, continuation, and possibly treatment  of CUD in females.

METHODS: Eighteen non-NPSLE  patients and 18 matched subjects were all tested using the Montreal cognitive  assessment scale test and scanned using blood-oxygen-level dependent fMRI while  performing the n-back task to investigate the activation intensity of some  cognition-related areas. RESULTS: Ethology results showed that non-NPSLE patients  had mild cognitive dysfunction and memory dysfunction (p < 0.05). The fMRI scan  confirmed a neural network consisting of bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  (DLPFC), premotor area, parietal lobe, and supplementary motor area (SMA)/anterior  cingulate cortex (ACC) that was activated during the n-back task, with right  hemisphere dominance. However, only the right SMA/ACC showed a load effect in the  non-NPSLE group; the activation intensity of most WM-related brain areas for the  non-NPSLE group was lower than for the control group under 3 memory loads. Further,  we found that the activation intensity of some cognition-related areas, including  the bilateral caudate nucleus/insula and hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus were  lower than the control group under the memory loads. An inverse correlation existed  between individual activation intensity and disease duration.

OBJECTIVES: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to  compare pathophysiological changes in brain function between solvent-exposed and  control workers. METHODS: Painters, drywall tapers, and carpenters were recruited  from the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, District Council 9 in  New York City and District Council 21 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and from the  Carpenters Union in New Jersey. Twenty-seven solvent-exposed and 27 control subjects  of similar age, education, and occupational status completed the N-Back working  memory test during fMRI. After controlling for confounders (age; lifetime marijuana,  cocaine, and alcohol use; blood lead; symptoms of depression; verbal intelligence),  voxelwise group analysis and regional activation levels were compared and then  correlated with an index of lifetime solvent exposure. RESULTS: Solvent-exposed  workers' performance on the N-Back was significantly worse than that of controls.  Activation of the anterior cingulate, prefrontal, and parietal cortices--areas  serving working memory function and attention--was also significantly lower for  solvent-exposed workers relative to controls. After controlling for confounders, we  observed a negative correlation between lifetime solvent exposure and activation in  these same regions among the solvent-exposed workers. CONCLUSIONS: This study is one  of the few to document neural structures affected by exposure to solvents. Our  findings provide a biological mechanism for the neurobehavioral deficits in working  memory and attention that have previously been reported by other groups studying the  effects of chronic exposure to solvents.

We present a novel application of multivariate Partial Least Squares  (PLS) analysis that permitted the simultaneous modeling of relations between WM  integrity values from all major WM tracts and patterns of condition-related BOLD  signal across all GM regions. Our results indicate that greater microstructural  integrity of the major WM tracts was negatively related to condition-related blood  oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal in task-positive GM regions. This negative  relationship suggests that better quality of structural connections allows for more  efficient use of task-related GM processing resources. Individuals with more intact  WM further showed greater BOLD signal increases in typical ""task-negative"" regions  during fixation, and notably exhibited a balanced magnitude of BOLD response across  task-positive and -negative states.

A  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was performed to explore working  memory function in ALS. METHODS: To contribute to the growing research field that  employs structural and functional neuroimaging to investigate the effect of ALS on  different working memory components, the localization and intensity of alterations  in neural activity was explored using fMRI. Being the first study to specifically  address verbal working memory via fMRI in the context of ALS, the verbal n-back task  with 0-back and 2-back conditions was employed. RESULTS: Despite ALS patients  showing unimpaired accuracies (p = 0.724) and reaction times (p = 0.0785), there was  significantly increased brain activity of frontotemporal and parietal regions in the  2-back minus 0-back contrast in patients compared to controls (using nonparametric  statistics with 5000 permutations and a T threshold of 2.5). DISCUSSION: Increased  brain activity of the frontotemporal and parietal regions during working memory  performance was largely associated with better neuropsychological function within  the ALS group, suggesting a compensatory effect during working memory execution.

METHODS: We  compared neural responses during hot and cold cognitive tasks in 99 individuals:  those at familial risk for depression (N = 30 unaffected first-degree relatives of  depressed individuals) and those currently experiencing a major depressive episode  (N = 39 unmedicated depressed patients) with low-risk healthy controls (N = 30).  Primary analyses assessed neural activation on two functional magnetic resonance  imaging tasks previously associated with depression: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  (DLPFC) responsivity during the n-back working memory task; and amygdala and  subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) responsivity during incidental emotional  face processing. RESULTS: Depressed patients exhibited significantly attenuated  working memory-related DLPFC activation, compared to low-risk controls and  unaffected relatives; unaffected relatives did not differ from low-risk controls. We  did not observe a complementary pattern during emotion processing. However, we found  preliminary support that greater DLPFC activation was associated with lower amygdala  response during emotion processing. LIMITATIONS: These findings require confirmation  in a longitudinal study to observe each individual's risk of developing depression;  without this, we cannot identify the true risk level of the first-degree relative or  low-risk control group. CONCLUSIONS: These findings have implications for  understanding the neural mechanisms of risk and resilience in depression: they are  consistent with the suggestion that preserved executive function might confer  resilience to developing depression in first-degree relatives of depressed patients.",2020-09-01,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,389-398,NA,,274,NA,J Affect Disord,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

At the very least, diagnostic markers should be able to  differentiate patients with BD from healthy individuals and from individuals at  familial risk for BD who either remain well or develop other psychopathology, most  commonly Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). These issues are particularly pertinent to  the development of translational applications of neuroimaging as they represent  challenges for which clinical observation alone is insufficient. We therefore  applied pattern classification to task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging  (fMRI) data of the n-back working memory task, to test their predictive value in  differentiating patients with BD (n=30) from healthy individuals (n=30) and from  patients' relatives who were either diagnosed with MDD (n=30) or were free of any  personal lifetime history of psychopathology (n=30). Diagnostic stability in these  groups was confirmed with 4-year prospective follow-up. Task-based activation  patterns from the fMRI data were analyzed with Gaussian Process Classifiers (GPC), a  machine learning approach to detecting multivariate patterns in neuroimaging  datasets. Consistent significant classification results were only obtained using  data from the 3-back versus 0-back contrast. Using contrast, patients with BD were  correctly classified compared to unrelated healthy individuals with an accuracy of  83.5%, sensitivity of 84.6% and specificity of 92.3%. Classification accuracy,  sensitivity and specificity when comparing patients with BD to their relatives with  MDD, were respectively 73.1%, 53.9% and 94.5%. Classification accuracy, sensitivity  and specificity when comparing patients with BD to their healthy relatives were  respectively 81.8%, 72.7% and 90.9%. We show that significant individual  classification can be achieved using whole brain pattern analysis of task-based  working memory fMRI data. The high accuracy and specificity achieved by all three  classifiers suggest that multivariate pattern recognition analyses can aid  clinicians in the clinical care of BD in situations of true clinical uncertainty  regarding the diagnosis and prognosis.",2017-01-15,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,230-237,NA,Pt B,145,NA,Neuroimage,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

Schizophrenia with OCD  (""schizo-obsessive"") patients are characterized by distinct clinical  characteristics, treatment response and prognosis. Whether schizo-obsessive patients  exhibit a distinct pattern of brain activation is yet unknown. To address this  question, the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study explicitly  compared alterations in brain activation and functional connectivity (FC) underlying  a working memory deficit in schizophrenia patients with and without OCD. METHODS:  fMRI was applied during the N-back working memory (WM) task in three groups:  schizo-obsessive (n=16), schizophrenia (n=17) and matched healthy volunteers (n=20).  WM-related activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the  right caudate nucleus, brain areas relevant to schizophrenia and OCD, and FC  analysis were used for the evaluation. RESULTS: The two schizophrenia groups with  and without OCD exhibited a similar reduction in activation in the right DLPFC and  right caudate, as well as decreased FC compared to the healthy controls. Notably,  reduced regional brain activation was not related to severity of schizophrenic or  OCD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Schizo-obsessive patients do not differ from their  non-OCD schizophrenia counterparts in brain activation patterns during the N-back WM  task.

Oxytocin is a hypothalamic neuropeptide that has demonstrated  promise in modulating neurobiological and behavioral correlates of PTSD. Cognitive  deficits in areas such as working memory and executive control are highly prevalent  among individuals with PTSD and oxytocin might modulate these impairments in  individuals with PTSD. Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, this study  employed functional MRI (fMRI) and the n-back working memory task to examine the  effects of oxytocin (24 IU) versus placebo on working memory and dorsolateral  prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) connectivity among individuals with PTSD (n = 16) as  compared with a trauma-exposed control group (n = 18). Results indicate that  individuals with PTSD on oxytocin performed better in the 2-back condition of the  n-back task compared with individuals with PTSD on placebo. Results also indicate  that connectivity between DLPFC and anterior cingulate increased in the 2-back  condition among individuals with PTSD on oxytocin as compared with placebo. These  findings provide preliminary evidence of an effect of oxytocin on working memory  among individuals with PTSD and insights into the neurobiological mechanisms  underlying this association.

Despite the frequent co-occurrence of  these conditions, cognitive neuroscience studies examining comorbid depression and  anxiety are limited. The goal of the present study was to examine the unique and  combined effect of depressive and anxiety symptoms on cognitive and brain  functioning in young and older adults. METHODS: Seventy-one healthy,  community-dwelling adults between the ages of 18 and 81 were administered a  neuropsychological battery and completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies  Depression Scale (CES-D) and the trait form of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory  (STAI-T). A subset of 25 participants also underwent functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI) scanning while completing the n-back working memory task. RESULTS:  Total depressive symptoms, depressed mood symptoms, and somatic symptoms were  associated with deficits in speed, working memory and executive functions,  especially in older adults. Symptoms of lack of well-being were not associated with  any neuropsychological test. Anxiety was associated with better attention and  working memory. Moreover, anxiety modified the relationship between depressive  symptoms and executive functioning in older adults, as elevated depressive symptoms  were associated with worse performance at low levels of anxiety, but not at higher  anxiety levels. Similarly, analysis of fMRI data showed that total depressive  symptoms and depressed mood symptoms were associated with decreased activity in the  superior frontal gyrus at low anxiety levels, but not at high anxiety levels.  CONCLUSION: Results confirm previous reports that subthreshold depression and  anxiety impact cognitive and brain functioning and suggest that the interaction of  depression and anxiety results in distinct cognitive and brain changes.

Two WM  processes can be distinguished: maintenance (i.e., storing, monitoring, and matching  information) and manipulation (i.e., reordering and updating information). A number  of studies have reported an age-related decline in WM, but the mechanisms underlying  this deterioration need to be investigated. Previous research, including studies  conducted in our laboratory, revealed that age-related cognitive deficits are  related to decreased millisecond timing, i.e., the ability to perceive and organize  incoming events in time. The aim of the current study was: (1) to identify in the  elderly the brain network involved in the maintenance and manipulation WM processes;  and (2) to use an fMRI task to investigate the relation between the brain activity  associated with these two processes and the efficiency of temporal information  processing (TIP) on a millisecond level reflected by psychophysical indices.  Subjects were 41 normal healthy elderly people aged from 62 to 78 years. They  performed: (1) an auditory verbal n-back task for assessing WM efficiency in an MRI  scanner; and (2) a psychophysical auditory temporal-order judgment (TOJ) task for  assessing temporal resolution in the millisecond domain outside the scanner. The  n-back task comprised three conditions (0-, 1-, and 2-back), which allowed  maintenance (1- vs. 0-back comparisons) and manipulation (2- vs. 1-back comparisons)  processes to be distinguished. Results revealed the involvement of a similar brain  network in the elderly to that found in previous studies. However, during  maintenance processes, we found relatively limited and focused activations, which  were significantly extended during manipulation. A novel result of our study, never  reported before, is an indication of significant moderate correlations between the  efficiency of WM and TIP. These correlations were found only for manipulation but  not for maintenance. Our results confirmed the hypothesis that manipulation in the  elderly is a dynamic process requiring skilled millisecond timing with high temporal  resolution. We conclude that millisecond timing contributes to WM manipulation in  the elderly, but not to maintenance.",2020,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,194,NA,,12,NA,Front Aging Neurosci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,"Copyright © 2020 Jablonska, Piotrowska, Bednarek, Szymaszek, Marchewka, Wypych and Szelag.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 32848698  PMCID: PMC7396649,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/666QY2KH/Jablonska et al. - 2020 - Maintenance vs. Manipulation in Auditory Verbal Wo.pdf,NA,fMRI; working memory; auditory n-back task; maintenance and manipulation processes; temporal information processing,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Jablonska et al. - 2020 - Maintenance vs. Manipulation in Auditory Verbal Wo.pdf

Identifying biomarkers of preclinical cognitive decline is critical in the  development of preventative therapies, and peripheral inflammation may be able to  serve as an indicator of cognitive decline. However, little is known regarding the  relationship between peripheral inflammation and brain structure and function among  older adults. METHODS: Twenty-four older adults (mean age = 78) underwent a  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) resting state functional connectivity  scan, and a subset (n = 14) completed the n-Back working memory task in the scanner.  All participants completed a blood draw, and inflammation was measured with  interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP). RESULTS: Surprisingly, age was  unrelated to measures of inflammation (IL-6, CRP) or brain function (default mode  network (DMN) connectivity; working memory performance; blood oxygenation level  dependent (BOLD) activation with higher working memory load). However, lower  functional connectivity between the left parietal seed and all other DMN regions was  associated with higher levels of IL-6 and CRP. Additionally, greater plasma  concentration of IL-6 was associated with lower BOLD activation in the left middle  frontal gyrus in response to increased working memory load. CONCLUSIONS: These  preliminary findings support the importance of IL-6 and CRP in brain function among  older adults. Frontal and parietal regions may be particularly sensitive to the  effects of inflammation. Additionally, these findings provide preliminary evidence  of inflammatory contributions to level of neural activity, even after accounting for  vascular risk factors.",Mar-17,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,341-349,NA,3,32,NA,Int J Geriatr Psychiatry,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,"Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 27094339  PMCID: PMC5071119,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/J3LCMA8H/Dev et al. - 2017 - Peripheral inflammation related to lower fMRI acti.pdf,NA,"Humans; Female; Male; Aged; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; *Brain Mapping; Memory, Short-Term/physiology; Cognition; functional MRI; Rest; *Cognitive Dysfunction; *Inflammation; *Parietal Lobe/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology; aging; C-Reactive Protein/analysis; cognitive health; Frontal Lobe; inflammation; Interleukin-6/blood; resting state connectivity",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Dev et al. - 2017 - Peripheral inflammation related to lower fMRI acti.pdf

The aim of this proof of concept study was to establish the nature of abnormalities,  in terms of activity and connectivity, in the working memory network of TBI patients  and how these relate to compromised behavioral outcomes. Further, this study  examined the neural correlates of working memory improvement following the  administration of methylphenidate. We report behavioral, functional and structural  MRI data from a group of 15 Healthy Controls (HC) and a group of 15 TBI patients,  acquired during the execution of the N-back task. The patients were studied on two  occasions after the administration of either placebo or 30 mg of methylphenidate.  Between group tests revealed a significant difference in performance when HCs were  compared to TBI patients on placebo [F((1, 28)) = 4.426, p < 0.05, η (p)(2) =  0.136]. This difference disappeared when the patients took methylphenidate [F((1,  28)) = 3.665, p = 0.66]. Patients in the middle range of baseline performance  demonstrated the most benefit from methylphenidate. Changes in the TBI patient  activation levels in the Left Cerebellum significantly and positively correlated  with changes in performance (r = 0.509, df = 13, p = 0.05). Whole-brain connectivity  analysis using the Left Cerebellum as a seed revealed widespread negative  interactions between the Left Cerebellum and parietal and frontal cortices as well  as subcortical areas. Neither the TBI group on methylphenidate nor the HC group  demonstrated any significant negative interactions. Our findings indicate that (a)  TBI significantly reduces the levels of activation and connectivity strength between  key areas of the working memory network and (b) Methylphenidate improves the  cognitive outcomes on a working memory task.

By including a multimodal dual-task component, the task is  demanding to the human cognitive system. We investigated whether dual n-back  training improves general cognitive resources or a task-specific WM updating process  in participants. We expected: (1) widespread transfer effects and the recruitment of  a common neuronal network by the training and the transfer tasks and (2) narrower  transfer results and that a common activation network alone would not produce  transfer, but instead an activation focus on the striatum, which is associated with  WM updating processes. The training group showed transfer to an untrained  dual-modality WM updating task, but not to single-task versions of the training or  the transfer task. They also showed diminished neuronal overlap between the training  and the transfer task from pretest to posttest and an increase in striatal  activation in both tasks. Furthermore, we found an association between the striatal  activation increase and behavioral improvement. The control groups showed no  transfer and no change in the amount of activation overlap or in striatal activation  from pretest to posttest. We conclude that, instead of improving general cognitive  resources (which would have required a transfer effect to all transfer tasks and  that a frontal activation overlap between the tasks produced transfer), dual n-back  training improved a task-specific process: WM updating of stimuli from two  modalities. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The current study allows for a better  understanding of the cognitive and neural effects of working memory (WM) training  and transfer. It shows that dual n-back training mainly improves specific processes  of WM updating, and this improvement leads to narrow transfer effects to tasks  involving the same processes. On a neuronal level this is accompanied by increased  neural activation in the striatum that is related to WM updating. The current  findings challenge the view that dual n-back training provokes a general boosting of  the WM system and of its neural underpinnings located in frontoparietal brain  regions. Instead, the findings imply the relevance of task-specific brain regions  which are involved in important cognitive processes during training and transfer  tasks.",2016-09-28,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,10198-10213,NA,39,36,NA,J Neurosci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,Copyright © 2016 the authors 0270-6474/16/3610198-16$15.00/0.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 27683914  PMCID: PMC6705577,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/28F9KUMX/Salminen et al. - 2016 - Transfer after Dual n-Back Training Depends on Str.pdf,NA,"Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Young Adult; Cognition/physiology; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; *fMRI; *working memory; Task Performance and Analysis; Neuronal Plasticity/*physiology; Nerve Net/*physiology; Executive Function/physiology; Attention/physiology; *dual n-back; *Practice, Psychological; *training; *transfer; Adaptation, Physiological/physiology; Auditory Perception; Conditioning, Psychological/physiology; Corpus Striatum/*physiology; Transfer, Psychology/*physiology; Visual Perception",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Salminen et al. - 2016 - Transfer after Dual n-Back Training Depends on Str.pdf

Theoretical models of neural-cognitive relationships define  neural efficiency and neural capacity as two parameters to describe the rate of gain  of brain activity and the upper limits of the increases, respectively. Although  qualitatively well described, there are limited discussions and demonstrations of  estimating these parameters from data. The current work presents a method using a  quadratic equation model of cognitive demands. The methods were applied to 21  healthy young adults while engaging in four levels of the verbal n-back working  memory task (0, 1, 2 and 3-back). Measures of the area under the curve captured both  linear and curvilinear responses to quantify the locations and amounts of  task-related increases in brain activity. In addition, we calculated voxel-wise maps  of neural efficiency and neural capacity. Results showed increases in brain  activation in regions typically involved in working memory. The relationships  between increasing cognitive demands and brain activity also differed across the  brain within and between individuals, as indicated by differential neural efficiency  and neural capacity values. This approach provides tools for evaluating current  theories about the relationships between brain activity and cognition. Neural  efficiency and neural capacity provide physiological measures of brain activity,  which will help evaluate how age, disease and intervention processes affect brain  activity.

Association studies of COMT and working memory in healthy volunteers  have yielded inconsistent results, possibly because of small sample sizes. Here we  examine COMT in relation to N-Back working memory task performance in a large  population-based cohort of young adults. We predicted individuals with one or two  copies of the Met allele would perform better, and that this relationship would be  more evident in males than females.

We used multiple regression to examine effects of sex and COMT genotype on N-Back  hits, false positives, discriminability (d'), and reaction time while controlling  for important covariates. COMT genotype did not predict hits or d'. There was a  nominally significant interaction between COMT and sex on false positives, but this  was not in the predicted direction, and was not significant after controlling for  covariates. COMT genotype was not related to working memory in this large  population-based cohort.

In addition, the type and severity of neonatal brain injury associated with very  preterm birth may exert differential effects on executive functioning by altering  its neuroanatomical substrates. Here we addressed this question by investigating  with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) the haemodynamic response during  executive-type processing using a phonological verbal fluency and a working memory  task in VPT-born young adults who had experienced differing degrees of neonatal  brain injury. 12 VPT individuals with a history of periventricular haemorrhage and  ventricular dilatation (PVH+VD), 17 VPT individuals with a history of uncomplicated  periventricular haemorrhage (UPVH), 13 VPT individuals with no history of neonatal  brain injury and 17 controls received an MRI scan whilst completing a verbal fluency  task with two cognitive loads ('easy' and 'hard' letters). Two groups of VPT  individuals (PVH+VD; n = 10, UPVH; n = 8) performed an n-back task with three  cognitive loads (1-, 2-, 3-back). Results demonstrated that VPT individuals  displayed hyperactivation in frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices and in caudate  nucleus, insula and thalamus compared to controls, as demands of the verbal fluency  task increased, regardless of type of neonatal brain injury. On the other hand,  during the n-back task and as working memory load increased, the PVH+VD group showed  less engagement of the frontal cortex than the UPVH group.

Several lines of evidence suggest that estrogen may  produce its effects on cognition and mood through modulation of serotonergic  function. To test this hypothesis, we used the tryptophan depletion (TD) paradigm to  lower central serotonin levels and pharmacologically manipulated estrogen levels in  healthy menopausal women. We examined the individual and combined effects of  estradiol and serotonin on working memory, emotion processing and task-related brain  activation. Eight healthy predominantly early postmenopausal women underwent TD or  sham depletion followed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) both before  and after short-term transdermal estradiol 75-150 μg/d administration. There was an  estradiol treatment by TD interaction for brain activation during performance on  both the N-back Task (working memory) and Emotion Identification Task (affective  processing). During the 2-back condition, TD attenuated activation prior to, but not  after, estradiol treatment in the right and left dorsal lateral prefrontal and  middle frontal/cingulate gyrus. During emotion identification, TD heightened  activation in the orbital frontal cortex and bilateral amygdala, and this effect was  attenuated by estradiol treatment. These results provide preliminary evidence that  serotonergic effects directly mediate the impact of estrogen on brain activation  during working memory and affective processing.",Mar-12,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,372-382,NA,3,37,NA,Psychoneuroendocrinology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We previously proposed that the recruitment observed in this literature  represents auxiliary support resources, and that recruitment of PFC is not abnormal  or injury specific and should reduce as novelty and challenge decrease. The current  study directly tests this hypothesis in the context of practice of a working memory  task. It was hypothesized that individuals with brain injury would demonstrate  recruitment of previously indicated regions, behavioral improvement following task  practice, and a reduction in the BOLD signal in recruited regions after practice.  Individuals with traumatic brain injury and healthy controls performed the n-back  during fMRI acquisition, practiced each task out of the scanner, and returned to the  scanner for additional fMRI n-back acquisition. Statistical parametric maps  demonstrated a number of regions of recruitment in the 1-back in individuals with  brain injury and a number of corresponding regions of reduced activation in  individuals with brain injury following practice in both the 1-back and 2-back.  Regions of interest demonstrated reduced activation following practice, including  the anterior cingulate and right prefrontal cortices.

The phenotype is a promising marker for the effects of  plasticity-enhancing interventions, such as high-frequency repetitive transcranial  magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and can be studied in healthy volunteers in the absence  of illness-related confounds, but the relationship to brain plasticity is  unexplored. We recruited 39 healthy volunteers to investigate the effects of 5 Hz  rTMS on prefrontal-hippocampal coupling during working memory and rest. In a  randomized and sham-controlled experiment, neuronavigation-guided rTMS was applied  to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and fMRI and functional  connectivity analyses [seeded connectivity and psychophysiological interaction  (PPI)] were used as readouts. Moreover, the test-retest reliability of  working-memory related connectivity markers was evaluated. rTMS provoked a  significant decrease in seeded functional connectivity of the right DLPFC and left  hippocampus during working memory that proved to be relatively time-invariant and  robust. PPI analyses provided evidence for a nominal effect of rTMS and poor  test-retest reliability. No effects on n-back-related activation and  DLPFC-hippocampus resting-state connectivity were observed.

Participants  performed 32 sessions of this training on their personal computers. In addition, we  assessed direct effects of the training by applying a verbal WM task before and  after the training. Participants (mean age 55.85 ± 4.24 years) were pseudo-randomly  assigned to the experimental group (n = 30) or an active control group (n = 27).  Training resulted in an activity decrease in regions known to be involved in verbal  WM (i.e., fronto-parieto-cerebellar circuitry and subcortical regions), indicating  that the brain became potentially more efficient after the training.

However, the regional modular organization was not associated with  behavioral performance. Global measures of modular organization did not change with  working memory load but were associated with individual variability in behavioral  performance.

This  report investigates predicting the pharmacological treatment from functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data using a supervised machine learning approach.  A total of 84 patients with UD or BD were included in a randomized double-blind  parallel-group study in which they received eight weekly infusions of either EPO (40  000 IU) or saline. Task fMRI data were collected before EPO/saline infusions started  (baseline) and 6 weeks after last infusion (follow-up). During the scanning  sessions, participants were given an n-back working memory and a picture encoding  task. Linear classification models with different regularization techniques were  used to predict treatment status from both cross-sectional data (at follow-up) and  longitudinal data (difference between baseline and follow-up). For the n-back and  picture encoding tasks, data were available and analyzed for 52 (EPO; n = 28,  Saline; n = 24) and 59 patients (EPO; n = 31, Saline; n = 28), respectively.

Since patients with attention  deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are characterized by both underactivation of  the prefrontal cortex and deficits in WM, the modulation of prefrontal activity with  tDCS in ADHD patients may increase their WM performance as well as improve the  activation and connectivity of the WM network. In the present study, this hypothesis  was tested using a double-blind sham-controlled experimental design. After  randomization, sixteen adolescents with ADHD underwent either anodal tDCS over the  left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, 1 mA, 20 min) or sham stimulation with  simultaneous fMRI during n-back WM task. Both in one-back and two-back conditions,  tDCS led to a greater activation (compared with sham stimulation) of the left DLPFC  (under the electrode), left premotor cortex, left supplementary motor cortex, and  precuneus. The effects of tDCS were long-lasting and influenced resting state  functional connectivity even 20 min after the stimulation, with patterns of  strengthened DLPFC connectivity after tDCS outlining the WM network. In summary,  anodal tDCS caused increased neuronal activation and connectivity, not only in the  brain area under the stimulating electrode (i.e. left DLPFC) but also in other, more  remote brain regions.

We addressed this  issue by using functional MRI and a working memory paradigm to study familial and  clinical high-risk groups. We recruited 17 subjects at ultra-high-risk (UHR) for  psychosis, 10 non-affected siblings of patients with schizophrenia (familial high  risk [FHR]) and 15 healthy controls.

In the high-risk groups, activation in  the precuneus was associated with the level of negative symptoms.

WMT  claims to improve working memory, attention deficits, hyperactivity and fluid  intelligence, in line with plasticity brain changes. Critics argue that WMT is  unable to achieve ""far-transfer""-the attainment of benefits to cognition from one  taught context to another dissimilar context-associated with improved quality of  life. However, brain changes after a course of WMT in frontoparietal and striatal  circuits-that often occur prior to behavioral changes-may be a better indicator of  far-transfer efficacy, especially to improve impulse control commonly dysregulated  in those with addictive disorders, yet not commonly examined in WMT studies. METHOD:  In contrast to previous reviews, the aim here is to focus on the findings of brain  imaging WMT training studies across various imaging modalities that use various  paradigms, published via PubMed, Scopus, Medline, and Google Scholar. RESULTS: 35  brain imaging studies utilized fMRI, structural imaging (MRI, DTI), functional  connectivity, EEG, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), cerebral  perfusion, and neurogenetic analyses with tasks based on visuospatial and auditory  working memory, dual and standard n-back. DISCUSSION: Evidence suggests that  repeated WMT reduces brain activation in frontoparietal and striatal networks  reflective of increased neural circuitry efficiency via myelination and functional  connectivity changes. Neural effects of WMT may persist months after training has  ended, lead to non-trained task transfer, be strengthened by auxiliary methods such  as tDCS and be related to COMT polymorphisms. WMT could be utilized as an effective,  non-invasive intervention for working memory deficits to treat impulse and affective  control problems in people with addictive disorders.",2020,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,512761,NA,,11,NA,Front Psychiatry,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,"Copyright © 2020 Brooks, Mackenzie-Phelan, Tully and Schiöth.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 33132926  PMCID: PMC7511702,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/35UQKR3Z/Brooks et al. - 2020 - Review of the Neural Processes of Working Memory T.pdf,NA,n-back; working memory training; addiction; CogMed; frontoparietal; neuroplasticity; striatal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Brooks et al. - 2020 - Review of the Neural Processes of Working Memory T.pdf

In the current  study, we collected functional MRI (fMRI) data when the subjects were performing  n-back tasks and in resting-state.

Next, we performed physiophysiological interaction (PPI)  analysis using left and right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and superior parietal  lobule (SPL) regions, respectively, in three continuous-designed runs of  resting-state, 1-back, and 2-back conditions. No regions showed consistent  modulatory interactions with the seed pairs in the three conditions. Instead, the  anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) showed different modulatory interactions with the  right MFG and SPL among the three conditions.

Existing research probing task-related reconfiguration of brain  network structure has concluded that, although there are many similarities in  network structure during an intrinsic, resting state and during the performance of a  variety of cognitive tasks, there are meaningful differences as well. In this study,  we related intrinsic, resting state network organization to reconfigured network  organization during the performance of two tasks: a sequence tapping task, which is  thought to probe motor execution and likely engages a single brain network, and an  n-back task, which is thought to probe working memory and likely requires  coordination across multiple networks. We implemented graph theoretical analyses  using functional connectivity data from fMRI scans to calculate whole-brain measures  of network organization in healthy young adults. We focused on quantifying measures  of network segregation (modularity, system segregation, local efficiency, number of  provincial hub nodes) and measures of network integration (global efficiency, number  of connector hub nodes). Using these measures, we found converging evidence that  local, within-network communication is critical for motor execution, whereas  integrative, between-network communication is critical for working memory. These  results confirm that the human brain has the remarkable ability to reconfigure its  large-scale organization dynamically in response to current cognitive demands and  that interpreting reconfiguration in terms of network segregation and integration  may shed light on the optimal network structures underlying successful cognition.  SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The dynamic nature of the human brain gives rise to the wide  range of behaviors and cognition of which humans are capable. We collected fMRI data  from healthy young adults and measured large-scale functional connectivity patterns  between regions distributed across the entire brain. We implemented graph  theoretical analyses to quantify network organization during two tasks hypothesized  to require different combinations of brain networks. During motor execution,  segregation of distinct networks increased. Conversely, during working memory,  integration across networks increased. These changes in network organization were  related to better behavioral performance. These results underscore the human brain's  ability to reconfigure network organization selectively and adaptively when  confronted with changing cognitive demands to achieve an optimal balance between  segregation and integration.",2016-11-30,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,12083-12094,NA,48,36,NA,J Neurosci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,Copyright © 2016 the authors 0270-6474/16/3612083-12$15.00/0.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 27903719  PMCID: PMC5148214,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/K8VX3ZJH/Cohen and D'Esposito - 2016 - The Segregation and Integration of Distinct Brain .pdf,NA,"Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Models, Statistical; Computer Simulation; Brain Mapping; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Cognition/*physiology; Brain/*physiology; Psychomotor Performance/*physiology; *functional connectivity; *working memory; Nerve Net/*physiology; Neural Pathways/physiology; Executive Function/physiology; *graph theory; *individual differences; *Models, Neurological; *motor execution; *resting state",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Cohen and D'Esposito - 2016 - The Segregation and Integration of Distinct Brain .pdf

We first confirmed that mean pupil size closely followed working memory  load. Combining this with fMRI data, we focused on blood oxygen level dependent  (BOLD) correlates of mean pupil size modeled onto the task blocks as a parametric  modulation. Interrogating this modulated task regressor, we were able to retrieve  the frontoparietal network. Next, to fully exploit the within-block dynamics, we  divided the blocks into 1 s time bins and filled these with corresponding pupil  change values (first-order derivative of pupil size).

In addition, the lingual gyrus showed a higher functional  connectivity to the insula during processing of pornographic stimuli in the patient  group. In contrast, healthy subjects showed faster responses when confronted with  pornographic pictures only with high cognitive load. Also, patients showed a better  memory for pornographic pictures in a surprise recognition task compared to  controls, speaking for a higher relevance of pornographic material in the patient  group. These findings are in line with the incentive salience theory of addiction,  especially the higher functional connectivity to the salience network with the  insula as a key hub and the higher lingual activity during processing of  pornographic pictures depending on recent pornography consumption.",2020,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,102308,NA,,27,NA,Neuroimage Clin,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

We conducted the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while  sixteen subjects were performing face- and location-matching n-back tasks to examine  causal relations within the frontoparietal networks. METHODS: We applied a  sophisticated method, the structural equation modeling (SEM), to the fMRI data. The  imaging data were analyzed by extracting the task-related eigenseries using the  principal component analysis (PCA) and then by applying a form of data-driven model  called the automated search method. RESULTS: The SEM analyses revealed a functional  shift of network connectivity from the right to the left hemisphere with increasing  load in the face-matching n-back tasks while the location-matching tasks required  bilateral activation. In the locating matching n-back tasks, a pattern of parallel  processing was observed in the left phonological loop and the right inferior  parietal regions. Furthermore, object working memory-related activities in the left  hemisphere reliably contributed to performance of both the face- and  location-matching 2-back tasks. CONCLUSION: Our results are consistent with previous  reports in terms of demonstrating parallel and distributed information processing  during performing working memory tasks with heavy loads. Our results additionally  suggest a dynamic shift between the fast imagery circuit (right hemisphere) and the  stable verbal circuit (left hemisphere), depending on task load.",Sep-12,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,283-292,NA,3,9,NA,Psychiatry Investig,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 22993529  PMCID: PMC3440479,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/YNM2VF49/Kim et al. - 2012 - Changes in effective connectivity according to wor.pdf,NA,Working memory; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Face matching; Location matching; Structural equation modeling,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Kim et al. - 2012 - Changes in effective connectivity according to wor.pdf

A circuit with connections to this system, including the dorsolateral  prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate (AC) cortex, has been identified in  studies applying functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to a broad range of  cognitive tasks. We examined the influence of E, assessed with the Eysenck  Personality Questionnaire-Revised (Eysenck and Eysenck, 1991), in fMRI activity  during an ""n-back"" task involving four memory loads (0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-back) and a  rest condition in healthy men. To confirm the specificity of E effects, we also  examined the effects of neuroticism and psychoticism (P) scores. We observed that,  as predicted by Eysenck's model, the higher the E score, the greater the change in  fMRI signal from rest to the 3-back condition in the DLPFC and AC. In addition, E  scores were negatively associated with resting fMRI signals in the thalamus and  Broca's area extending to Wernicke's area, supporting the hypothesized (negative)  relationship between E and resting arousal. P scores negatively correlated with  resting fMRI signal in the globus pallidus-putamen, extending previous findings of a  negative relationship of schizotypy to striatal activity seen with older  neuroimaging modalities to fMRI. These observations suggest that individual  differences affect brain responses during cognitive activity and at rest and provide  evidence for the hypothesized neurobiological basis of personality.",2004-11-24,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,10636-10641,NA,47,24,NA,J Neurosci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 15564579  PMCID: PMC6730115,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/RQEJ7S2J/Kumari et al. - 2004 - Personality predicts brain responses to cognitive .pdf,NA,"Humans; Male; Adult; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Arousal/physiology; Cognition/*physiology; Frontal Lobe/physiology; Prefrontal Cortex/physiology; Brain/anatomy & histology/*physiology; Extraversion, Psychological; Introversion, Psychological; Neurotic Disorders/physiopathology; Personality/*physiology; Psychotic Disorders/physiopathology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Kumari et al. - 2004 - Personality predicts brain responses to cognitive .pdf

While fNIRS has gained  interest as a potential alternative to fMRI for use with clinical and pediatric  populations, it remains unclear whether fNIRS has the necessary sensitivity to serve  as a replacement for fMRI. The present study set out to examine whether fNIRS has  the sensitivity to detect linear changes in activation and functional connectivity  in response to cognitive load, and functional connectivity changes when  transitioning from a task-free resting state to a task. Sixteen young adult subjects  were scanned with a continuous-wave fNIRS system during a 10-min resting-state scan  followed by a letter n-back task with three load conditions. Five optical probes  were placed over frontal and parietal cortices, covering bilateral dorsolateral PFC  (dlPFC), bilateral ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC), frontopolar cortex (FP), and bilateral  parietal cortex. Activation was found to scale linearly with working memory load in  bilateral prefrontal cortex. Functional connectivity increased with increasing  n-back loads for fronto-parietal, interhemispheric dlPFC, and local connections.  Functional connectivity differed between the resting state scan and the n-back scan,  with fronto-parietal connectivity greater during the n-back, and interhemispheric  vlPFC connectivity greater during rest. These results demonstrate that fNIRS is  sensitive to both cognitive load and state, suggesting that fNIRS is well-suited to  explore the full complement of neuroimaging research questions and will serve as a  viable alternative to fMRI.",2014,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,76,NA,,8,NA,Front Hum Neurosci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 24600374  PMCID: PMC3930096,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/2CX8AUB9/Fishburn et al. - 2014 - Sensitivity of fNIRS to cognitive state and load..pdf,NA,working memory; n-back; functional connectivity; resting state; fronto-parietal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Fishburn et al. - 2014 - Sensitivity of fNIRS to cognitive state and load..pdf

However,  time-of-day modulations may differ across cognitive domains. Using functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated how chronotype and time of day  interact with working memory at different levels of cognitive load/complexity in a  N-back paradigm (N0-, N2-, and N3-back levels). Extreme morning- and evening-type  individuals underwent two fMRI sessions during N-back performance, one 1.5 h  (morning) and one 10.5 h (evening) after wake-up time scheduled according to their  habitual sleep-wake preference. At the behavioral level, increasing working memory  load resulted in lower accuracy while chronotype and time of day only exerted a  marginal impact on performance. Analyses of neuroimaging data disclosed an  interaction between chronotype, time of day, and the modulation of cerebral activity  by working memory load in the thalamus and in the middle frontal cortex. In the  subjective evening hours, evening types exhibited higher thalamic activity than  morning types at the highest working memory load condition only (N3-back).  Conversely, morning-type individuals exhibited higher activity than evening-type  participants in the middle frontal gyrus during the morning session in the N3-back  condition. Our data emphasize interindividual differences in time-of-day preferences  and underlying cerebral activity, which should be taken into account when  investigating vigilance state effects in task-related brain activity. These results  support the hypothesis that higher task complexity leads to a chronotype-dependent  increase in thalamic and frontal brain activity, permitting stabilization of working  memory performance across the day.",2015,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,199,NA,,6,NA,Front Neurol,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 26441819  PMCID: PMC4585243,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/ALWDXPNU/Schmidt et al. - 2015 - Pushing the Limits Chronotype and Time of Day Mod.pdf,NA,working memory; BOLD activity; chronotype; task complexity; time of day,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Schmidt et al. - 2015 - Pushing the Limits Chronotype and Time of Day Mod.pdf

Clinical,NA,2213-1582,10.1016/j.nicl.2018.09.022,NA,"BACKGROUND: Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is a recreational drug associated with increasing numbers of GHB-dependent patients and emergency attendances often related  to GHB-induced comas. Working memory (WM) deficits have been reported in association  with GHB use, and animal studies have shown that GHB induces oxidative stress in  vulnerable WM-related brain areas such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  (DLPFC). However, the effects of chronic GHB use and multiple GHB-induced comas on  WM-related brain function in humans remains unknown. METHODS: We recruited 27 GHB  users with ≥4 GHB-induced comas (GHB-Coma), 27 GHB users who never experienced  GHB-induced coma (GHB-NoComa), and 27 polydrug users who never used GHB (No-GHB).  Participants performed an n-back WM task during functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI) to probe DLPFC functioning. RESULTS: The GHB-Coma group had lower  premorbid IQ (p = .006) than the GHB-NoComa group despite comparable age and  education level. There were also group differences in the use of other drugs than  GHB. Therefore, all group comparisons were adjusted for IQ and drug use other than  GHB. Compared with the GHB-NoComa and the No-GHB groups, the GHB-Coma group showed  increased activity in the right DLPFC (p(SVC) = 0.028) and increased functional  connectivity of the right DLPFC with a cluster comprising the left anterior  cingulate and medial frontal gyrus (p(FWE) = 0.003). No significant fMRI differences  were observed between the GHB-NoComa and No-GHB groups. Due to technical problems,  no behavioural data were collected. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that multiple  GHB-induced comas, but not GHB-use per se, are associated with alterations in  WM-related brain function. Public awareness campaigns are required to minimize the  potential adverse effects induced by GHB recreational use, and especially  GHB-induced comas, even if no immediate side effects are experienced.",2018,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,923-930,NA,,20,NA,Neuroimage Clin,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Comparing networks of healthy volunteers with those of patients can  potentially offer new, quantitative diagnostic methods and a framework for better  understanding brain and mind disorders. We explore resting state functional Magnetic  Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data through network measures. We construct networks  representing 15 healthy individuals and 12 schizophrenia patients (males and  females), all of whom are administered three drug treatments: i) a placebo; and two  antipsychotic medications ii) aripiprazole and iii) sulpiride. We compare these  resting state networks to a performance at an ""N-back"" working memory task. We  demonstrate that not only is there a distinctive network architecture in the healthy  brain that is disrupted in schizophrenia but also that both networks respond to  antipsychotic medication. We first reproduce the established finding that brain  networks of schizophrenia patients exhibit increased efficiency and reduced  clustering compared with controls. Our data then reveal that the antipsychotic  medications mitigate this effect, shifting the metrics toward those observed in  healthy volunteers, with a marked difference in efficacy between the two drugs.  Additionally, we find that aripiprazole considerably alters the network statistics  of healthy controls. Examining the ""N-back"" working memory task, we establish that  aripiprazole also adversely affects their performance. This suggests that changes to  macroscopic brain network architecture result in measurable behavioral differences.  This is one of the first studies to directly compare different medications using a  whole-brain graph theoretical analysis with accompanying behavioral data. The small  sample size is an inherent limitation and means a degree of caution is warranted in  interpreting the findings.

However, investigation of this type has been obscured by  incomparable verbal and spatial WM tasks and/or visual inspection at arbitrary  thresholds as means to assess lateralization. Furthermore, it is unclear whether  this hemispheric lateralization is present during adolescence, a time in which WM  skills are improving, and whether there is a developmental association with  laterality of brain functioning. This study used comparable verbal and spatial WM  n-back tasks during fMRI and a bootstrap analysis approach to calculate  lateralization indices (LIs) across several thresholds to examine the potential of a  left-right WM hemispheric dissociation in healthy adolescents. We found significant  left hemispheric lateralization for verbal WM, most notably in the frontal and  parietal lobes, as well as right hemisphere lateralization for spatial WM, seen in  frontal and temporal cortices. Although no significant relationships were observed  between LI and age or LI and performance, significant age-related patterns of brain  activity were demonstrated during both verbal and spatial WM. Specifically,  increased adolescent age was associated with less activity in the default mode brain  network during verbal WM. In contrast, increased adolescent age was associated with  greater activity in task-positive posterior parietal cortex during spatial working  memory. Our findings highlight the importance of utilizing non-biased statistical  methods and comparable tasks for determining patterns of functional lateralization.

Studies in which imaging of the DA system is integrated with functional imaging during cognitive performance have  yielded mixed findings. Some work has shown a link between striatal DA (measured by  PET) and fMRI activations, whereas others have failed to observe such a  relationship. One possible reason for these discrepant findings is differences in  task demands, such that a more demanding task with greater prefrontal activations  may yield a stronger association with DA. Moreover, a potential DA-BOLD association  may be modulated by task performance. We studied 155 (104 normal-performing and 51  low-performing) healthy older adults (43% females) who underwent fMRI scanning while  performing a working memory (WM) n-back task along with DA D(2/3) PET assessment  using [(11)C]raclopride. Using multivariate partial-least-squares analysis, we  observed a significant pattern revealing positive associations of striatal as well  as extrastriatal DA D(2/3) receptors to BOLD response in the  thalamo-striatal-cortical circuit, which supports WM functioning. Critically, the  DA-BOLD association in normal-performing, but not low-performing, individuals was  expressed in a load-dependent fashion, with stronger associations during 3-back than  1-/2-back conditions. Moreover, normal-performing adults expressing upregulated BOLD  in response to increasing task demands showed a stronger DA-BOLD association during  3-back, whereas low-performing individuals expressed a stronger association during  2-back conditions. This pattern suggests a nonlinear DA-BOLD performance  association, with the strongest link at the maximum capacity level. Together, our  results suggest that DA may have a stronger impact on functional brain responses  during more demanding cognitive tasks.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Dopamine (DA) is a  major neuromodulator in the CNS and plays a key role in several cognitive processes  via modulating the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Some studies  have shown a link between DA and BOLD, whereas others have failed to observe such a  relationship. A possible reason for the discrepancy is differences in task demands,  such that a more demanding task with greater prefrontal activations may yield a  stronger association with DA. We examined the relationship of DA to BOLD response  during working memory under three load conditions and found that the DA-BOLD  association is expressed in a load-dependent fashion. These findings may help  explain the disproportionate impairment evident in more effortful cognitive tasks in  normal aging and in those suffering dopamine-dependent neurodegenerative diseases  (e.g., Parkinson's disease).",2019-01-16,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,537-547,NA,3,39,NA,J Neurosci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,Copyright © 2019 Salami et al.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 30478031  PMCID: PMC6335744,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/2LZGJK3V/Salami et al. - 2019 - Dopamine D(23) Binding Potential Modulates Neural.pdf,NA,"Humans; Female; Male; Aged; Middle Aged; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Psychomotor Performance/physiology; *fMRI; *working memory; *PET; Prefrontal Cortex/physiology; *aging; *dopamine; Corpus Striatum/diagnostic imaging/metabolism/physiology; Dopamine Antagonists; Nerve Net/physiology; Positron-Emission Tomography; Raclopride; Radiopharmaceuticals; Receptors, Dopamine D2/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology; Receptors, Dopamine D3/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology; Thalamus/physiology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Salami et al. - 2019 - Dopamine D(23) Binding Potential Modulates Neural.pdf

The  aim of the study was to examine a partially remitted and remitted MDD patient group  with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using a cognitive activation  paradigm in order to probe aspects of response inhibition, attention shift, and  working memory. Twenty MDD patients and 19 healthy controls, matched for age and  sex, participated in the study. A working memory n-back task with single  presentations of incongruent Stroop words was used, with the instruction to either  remember the color of the ink the word was written in, or the color word itself,  presented two or three words back in the presentation series. MR images were  acquired on a 1.5-T GE Signa HD MR scanner. In addition to MR data, response time  (RT) and response accuracy (RA) behavioral data were recorded. The behavioral  results showed longer RT and lower RA in the MDD group compared to the control group  across instruction conditions and working memory load. Based on previous studies of  executive function, a composite region of interest (ROI) mask of the anterior  cingulate cortex (ACC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), caudate, and putamen  was used in statistical analysis. Significant activation was observed in controls  throughout this corticostriatal network. When compared to controls, patients showed  no significant difference in the level of activation in the ACC and the DLPFC.  However, in the putamen and caudate, hypoactivation in the patient group was  observed.

Since symptomatic  pharmacological treatment is not yet available alternative treatment strategies such  as cognitive rehabilitation are of particular interest. OBJECTIVES: To analyse the  ways in which MS patients respond to cognitive training, by combining behavioral and  fMRI data in a case-based triangulation approach. METHODS: Ten relapsing-remitting  (RR) MS patients aged between 39 and 58 years and between 1 and 8 years post MS  diagnosis were included. EDSS ranged from 1 to 3.5. Participants had normal to high  intelligence levels. Six patients were assigned to the training group (TG) and four  to the control group (CG) without intervention. The TG received a 4-week  computerized working memory (WM) training, consisting of 16 training sessions of  45 min duration each. Before and after the training a neuropsychological examination  and fMRI investigation by using an N-back task of different complexity was applied.  RESULTS: Patients in the TG responded differently to cognitive training. Four  participants did not meet the triangulation criteria for being treatment responders.  The two responders showed two distinct changes regarding activation patterns after  training: (I) decreased brain activation associated with increased processing speed  and (II) increased brain activation associated with higher processing speed and WM  performance. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of different and opposed response patterns  after the same training indicates a risk in applying classical group statistics.  Different and especially opposed patterns within the same sample may distort results  of classical statistical comparisons. Thus, underlying processes may not be  discovered and lead to misinterpretation of results.",2015,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,78,NA,,6,NA,Front Neurol,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 25904893  PMCID: PMC4389546,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/I45PKWJM/Hubacher et al. - 2015 - Case-Based fMRI Analysis after Cognitive Rehabilit.pdf,NA,fMRI; working memory; plasticity; cognitive training; multiple sclerosis; rehabilitation,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Hubacher et al. - 2015 - Case-Based fMRI Analysis after Cognitive Rehabilit.pdf

Based on basic science evidence for strong habituation of amygdala  response to repeated stimuli, we investigated whether a quantification of  habituation provides additional information beyond the usual estimate of the overall  mean activity. We assessed the within-subject reliability of amygdala habituation  measures during a facial emotion matching paradigm in 25 healthy subjects. We  extracted the amygdala signal decrement across the course of the fMRI run for the  two test-retest measurement sessions and compared reliability estimates with  previous findings based on mean response amplitude. Retest-reliability of the  session-wise amygdala habituation was significantly higher than the evoked amygdala  mean amplitude (intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC)=0.53 vs. 0.16). To test  the task-specificity of this finding, we compared the retest-reliability of amygdala  habituation across two different tasks. Significant amygdala response decrement was  also seen in a cognitive task (n-back working memory) that did not per se activate  the amygdala, but was totally unreliable in that context (ICC~0.0), arguing for  task-specificity. Together the results show that emotion-dependent amygdala  habituation is a robust and considerably more reliable index than the mean  amplitude, and provides a robust potential endpoint for within-subject designs  including pharmaco-fMRI studies.",Dec-14,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,383-390,NA,,103,NA,Neuroimage,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,Copyright © 2014.

Although FRDA is most readily  linked to motor and sensory dysfunctions, reported impairments in working memory and  executive functions indicate that abnormalities may also extend to associations  regions of the cerebral cortex and/or cerebello-cerebral interactions. To test this  hypothesis, 29 individuals with genetically confirmed FRDA and 34 healthy controls  performed a verbal n-back working memory task while undergoing functional magnetic  resonance imaging. No significant group differences were evident in task  performance. However, individuals with FRDA had deficits in brain activations both  in the lateral cerebellar hemispheres, principally encompassing lobule VI, and the  prefrontal cortex, including regions of the anterior insular and rostrolateral  prefrontal cortices. Functional connectivity between these brain regions was also  impaired, supporting a putative link between primary cerebellar dysfunction and  subsequent cerebral abnormalities. Disease severity and genetic markers of disease  liability were correlated specifically with cerebellar dysfunction, while  correlations between behavioural performance and both cerebral activations and  cerebello-cerebral connectivity were observed in controls, but not in the FRDA  cohort. Taken together, these findings support a diaschisis model of brain  dysfunction, whereby primary disease effects in the cerebellum result in functional  changes in downstream fronto-cerebellar networks. These fronto-cerebellar  disturbances provide a putative biological basis for the nonmotor symptoms observed  in FRDA, and reflect the consequence of localized cerebellar pathology to  distributed brain function underlying higher-order cognition.",Jan-16,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,338-350,NA,1,37,NA,Hum Brain Mapp,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,"© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 26502936  PMCID: PMC6867314,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/AS29BWZB/Harding et al. - 2016 - Fronto-cerebellar dysfunction and dysconnectivity .pdf,NA,"Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; fMRI; Oxygen/blood; working memory; Case-Control Studies; Reaction Time/physiology; Severity of Illness Index; functional connectivity; cognition; cerebellum; Friedreich ataxia; Cerebellar Diseases/*etiology; Cerebellum/blood supply/*pathology; Cerebral Cortex/blood supply/*pathology; Cognition Disorders/*etiology/*pathology; Friedreich Ataxia/*complications; psychophysiological interaction",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Harding et al. - 2016 - Fronto-cerebellar dysfunction and dysconnectivity .pdf

Mechanisms for age and performance-graded  differences in brain dynamics have, however, not yet been uncovered. Given the  age-related decline of the dopamine (DA) system in normal cognitive aging, DA  neuromodulation is one plausible mechanism. Hence, agents that boost systemic DA  [such as d-amphetamine (AMPH)] may help to restore deficient signal variability  levels. Furthermore, despite the standard practice of counterbalancing drug session  order (AMPH first vs. placebo first), it remains understudied how AMPH may interact  with practice effects, possibly influencing whether DA up-regulation is functional.  We examined the effects of AMPH on functional-MRI-based blood oxygen level-dependent  (BOLD) signal variability (SD(BOLD)) in younger and older adults during a working  memory task (letter n-back). Older adults expressed lower brain signal variability  at placebo, but met or exceeded young adult SD(BOLD) levels in the presence of AMPH.  Drug session order greatly moderated change-change relations between AMPH-driven  SD(BOLD) and reaction time means (RT(mean)) and SDs (RT(SD)). Older adults who  received AMPH in the first session tended to improve in RT(mean) and RT(SD) when  SD(BOLD) was boosted on AMPH, whereas younger and older adults who received AMPH in  the second session showed either a performance improvement when SD(BOLD) decreased  (for RT(mean)) or no effect at all (for RT(SD)).

A visual n-back task was used to test  working memory function during the fMRI scan. Responses were recorded via an MRI  compatible button box for analysis. fMRI scans were analyzed using statistical  parametric mapping software. All statistics were corrected for multiple comparisons  by false discovery rate, with p < 0.05 as significance.

Normal age-related declines  in working memory can cause loss of independence and decreased quality of life.  Cognitive training has shown some potential at enhancing certain cognitive  processes, although, enhancements are variable. Transcranial direct current  stimulation (tDCS), a form of non-invasive brain stimulation, has shown promise at  enhancing working memory abilities, and may further the benefits from cognitive  training interventions. However, the neural mechanisms underlying tDCS brain-based  enhancements remain unknown. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: Assess the effects of a 2-week  intervention of active-tDCS vs. sham paired with cognitive training on functional  connectivity of the working memory network during an N-Back working memory task.  METHODS: Healthy older adults (N = 28; mean age = 74 ± 7.3) completed 10-sessions of  cognitive training paired with active or sham-tDCS. Functional connectivity was  evaluated at baseline and post-intervention during an N-Back task (2-Back vs.  0-Back). RESULTS: Active-tDCS vs. sham demonstrated a significant increase in  connectivity between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right inferior  parietal lobule at post-intervention during 2-Back. Target accuracy on 2-Back was  significantly improved for active vs. sham at post-intervention. CONCLUSION: These  results suggest pairing tDCS with cognitive training enhances functional  connectivity and working memory performance in older adults, and thus may hold  promise as a method for remediating age-related cognitive decline. Future studies  evaluating optimal dose and long-term effects of tDCS on brain function will help to  maximize potential clinical impacts of tDCS paired with cognitive training in older  adults.

We examined brain activity during WM in persons at  clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. METHODS: Thirty-seven CHR and 34 healthy  control participants underwent functional MRI (fMRI) on a 3.0T scanner while  performing an N-back WM task. The sample included a sub-sample of CHR participants  who had no lifetime history of treatment with psychotropic medications (n=11). Data  were analyzed using SPM8 (2-back>0-back contrast). Pearson correlations between  brain activity, symptoms, and WM performance were examined. RESULTS: The total CHR  group and medication-naive CHR sub-sample were comparable to controls in most  demographic features and in N-back WM performance, but had significantly lower IQ.  Relative to controls, medication-naïve CHR showed hyperactivity in the left  parahippocampus (PHP) and the left caudate during performance of the N-back WM task.  Relative to medication-exposed CHR, medication naïve CHR exhibited hyperactivity in  the left caudate and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). DLPFC  activity was significantly negatively correlated with WM performance. PHP, caudate  and DLPFC activity correlated strongly with symptoms, but results did not withstand  FDR-correction for multiple comparisons.

However, whether and how  subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) causes any deficits in brain functions, and whether  a hormone-replacement treatment is necessary for SCH patients, still remain  controversial subjects. In the present study, functional MRI (fMRI) was used to  measure brain functions by asking euthyroid subjects, hyperthyroid patients and SCH  patients to perform the widely used digit n-back working memory task. After having  been treated with l-thyroxine for approximately 6 months, the SCH patients were  asked to do the same fMRI experiment. The hypothyroid and SCH patients scored  significantly lower in the 2-back task than either the hyperthyroid patients or the  euthyroid subjects (P < 0.012). The fMRI showed that a common frontoparietal  network, including bilateral middle/inferior frontal gyri (M/IFG), bilateral  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), bilateral premotor areas (PreMA), the  supplementary motor area/anterior cingulate cortex (SMA/ACC) and bilateral parietal  areas (PA), was activated by the n-back task in all the subjects. Further  quantitative analysis showed that the load effect of blood oxygen level-dependent  (BOLD) response appeared in all the five regions of interest (ROIs) in the euthyroid  and hyperthyroid subjects.

Working memory is linked to substance use disorders and can serve as a  representation of the demand placed on the neurophysiology associated with cognitive  control. METHODS: Behavior and brain activity (via fMRI) were recorded during an  N-Back working memory task in controls (CTRL), nondependent heavy drinkers (A-ND)  and dependent heavy drinkers (A-D). Typical and novel step-wise analyses examined  profiles of working memory load and increasing task demand, respectively. RESULTS:  Performance was significantly decreased in A-D during high working memory load  (2-Back), compared to CTRL and A-ND. Analysis of brain activity during high load  (0-Back vs. 2- Back) showed greater responses in the dorsal lateral and medial  prefrontal cortices of A-D than CTRL, suggesting increased but failed compensation.  The step-wise analysis revealed that the transition to Low Demand (0-Back to 1-Back)  was associated with robust increases and decreases in cognitive control and  default-mode brain regions, respectively, in A-D and A-ND but not CTRL. The  transition to High Demand (1-Back to 2-Back) resulted in additional engagement of  these networks in A-ND and CTRL, but not A-D. CONCLUSION: Heavy drinkers engaged  working memory neural networks at lower demand than controls. As demand increased,  nondependent heavy drinkers maintained control performance but relied on additional  neurophysiological resources, and dependent heavy drinkers did not display further  resource engagement and had poorer performance.

Given that working  memory performance is impaired in schizophrenia, especially at higher executive  loads, the authors investigated how this prefrontal functional organization might be  altered in disease, independent of performance deficits. METHOD: Using N-back  working memory functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, the authors  studied 15 patients with schizophrenia and 26 healthy comparison subjects. Subgroups  based on median performance accuracy at 2-back were analyzed; high performers  included eight schizophrenia patients and 14 comparison subjects, and low performers  included seven patients and 12 comparison subjects. RESULTS: High-performing but not  low-performing comparison subjects responded to incremental working memory executive  load with disproportionately greater dorsal but not ventral prefrontal cortex  activation, which also predicted performance accuracy. In the high- and  low-performing patient groups, incremental working memory load caused a  disproportionate increase in ventral but not dorsal prefrontal cortex activation  relative to the respective comparison group, which also correlated with accuracy.  Functional connectivity between the ventral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal  cortex was relatively greater in patients, whereas comparison subjects had greater  functional connectivity between the dorsal prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal  cortex. CONCLUSIONS: The hierarchical organization of the prefrontal cortex may be  compromised in schizophrenia, resulting in loss of functional specialization and  integration at the dorsal prefrontal cortex and in compensatory activation from the  ventral prefrontal cortex, which may ultimately affect working memory and executive  cognition.",Nov-06,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,1969-1977,NA,11,163,NA,Am J Psychiatry,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States PMID: 17074949,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/CI8R3GPR/Tan et al. - 2006 - Dysfunctional prefrontal regional specialization a.pdf,NA,Humans; Prefrontal Cortex/*physiopathology; Schizophrenia/*physiopathology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Tan et al. - 2006 - Dysfunctional prefrontal regional specialization a.pdf

Brain  areas related to semantic cognition, rule learning and decision making were  preferentially engaged in men during conceptual expansion, whereas women displayed  higher activity in regions related to speech processing and social perception.

Transcranial direct current  stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive form of brain stimulation that has demonstrated  potential for improving working memory performance in older adults. However, the  neural mechanisms underlying effects of tDCS on working memory are not well  understood. This mechanistic study investigated the acute and after-effects of  bilateral frontal (F3/F4) tDCS at 2 mA for 12-min on functional connectivity of the  working memory network in older adults. We hypothesized active tDCS over sham would  increase frontal connectivity during working memory performance. The study used a  double-blind within-subject 2 session crossover design. Participants performed an  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) N-Back working memory task before,  during, and after active or sham stimulation. Functional connectivity of the working  memory network was assessed within and between stimulation conditions (FDR < 0.05).  Active tDCS produced a significant increase in functional connectivity between left  ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and left dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) during  stimulation, but not after stimulation. Connectivity did not significantly increase  with sham stimulation. In addition, our data demonstrated both state-dependent and  time-dependent effects of tDCS working memory network connectivity in older adults.  tDCS during working memory performance produces a selective change in functional  connectivity of the working memory network in older adults.

The dysfunction of this region leads to synaptic  neuroplasticity impairment. It has been reported that several biochemical parameters  and anthropometric measurements play a vital role in cognition and brain health.  This study aimed to investigate the relationships between cognitive function, serum  biochemical profile, and anthropometric measurements using DLPFC activation. A  cross-sectional study was conducted among 35 older adults (≥60 years) who  experienced mild cognitive impairment (MCI). For this purpose, we distributed a  comprehensive interview-based questionnaire for collecting sociodemographic  information from the participants and conducting cognitive tests. Anthropometric  values were measured, and fasting blood specimens were collected. We investigated  their brain activation using the task-based functional MRI (fMRI; N-back),  specifically in the DLPFC region. Positive relationships were observed between  brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (β = 0.494, p < 0.01) and Mini-Mental State  Examination (MMSE) (β = 0.698, p < 0.01); however, negative relationships were  observed between serum triglyceride (β = -0.402, p < 0.05) and serum malondialdehyde  (MDA) (β = -0.326, p < 0.05) with right DLPFC activation (R (2) = 0.512) while the  participants performed 1-back task after adjustments for age, gender, and years of  education. In conclusion, higher serum triglycerides, higher oxidative stress, and  lower neurotrophic factor were associated with lower right DLPFC activation among  older adults with MCI.

Further, we  set out to investigate in the case that adults of advanced age do show age-related  increase in WM-related activity, what the functional significance of this  over-recruitment might be. Two groups of older adults - ""young-old"" (61-70 years, n  = 17) and ""old-old"" (77-82 years, n = 16) - were scanned while performing a visual  WM task (the n-back task: 0-back and 1-back).

Greater WM effects in the old-old than in the young-old group were  identified in the right caudal DLPFC. These results were replicated when we  performed a separate analysis between two age groups with the same level of WM  performance (the young-old vs. a ""high-performing"" subset of the old-old group).  There were no regions where WM effects were greater in the young-old group than in  the old-old group. Importantly, the magnitude of the over-recruitment WM effects  positively correlated with WM performance in the old-old group, but not in the  young-old group.

Commonly  observed strategies include prioritisation of gait at the cost of reduced  performance in the cognitive task. Alternatively alterations of gait parameters such  as gait velocity have been reported presumably to free processing capacity for the  benefit of performance in the cognitive task. The aim of this study was to describe  the neuroanatomical correlates of adaptive behavioural strategies in cognitive-motor  dual-tasking when the competition for information processing capacity is severe and  may exceed individuals' capacity limitations. METHODS: During an fMRI experiment, 12  young adults performed slow continuous, auditorily paced bilateral anti-phase ankle  dorsi-plantarflexion movements as an element of normal gait at .5 Hz in single and  dual task modes. The secondary task involved a visual, alphabetic N-back task with  presentation rate jittered around .7 Hz. The N-back task, which randomly occurred in  0-back or 2-back form, was modified into a silent counting task to avoid confounding  motor responses at the cost of slightly increasing the task's general coordinative  complexity. Participants' ankle movements were recorded using an optoelectronic  motion capture system to derive kinematic parameters representing the stability of  the movement timing and synchronization. Participants were instructed to perform  both tasks as accurately as possible. RESULTS: Increased processing complexity in  the dual-task 2-back condition led to significant changes in movement parameters  such as the average inter-response interval, the coefficient of variation of  absolute asynchrony and the standard deviation of peak angular velocity. A  regions-of-interest analysis indicated correlations between these parameters and  local activations within the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) such that lower IFG  activations coincided with performance decrements. CONCLUSIONS: Dual-task  interference effects show that the production of periodically timed ankle movements,  taken as modelling elements of the normal gait cycle, draws on higher-level  cognitive resources involved in working memory. The interference effect  predominantly concerns the timing accuracy of the ankle movements. Reduced  activations within regions of the left IFG, and in some respect also within the  superior parietal lobule, were identified as one factor affecting the timing of  periodic ankle movements resulting in involuntary 'hastening' during severe  dual-task working memory load. This 'hastening' phenomenon may be an expression of  re-automated locomotor control when higher-order cognitive processing capacity can  no longer be allocated to the movements due to the demands of the cognitive task.  The results of our study also propose the left IFG as a target region to improve  performance during dual-task walking by techniques for non-invasive brain  stimulation.",Sep-13,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,2142-2153,NA,11,51,NA,Neuropsychologia,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This conclusion is based primarily on functional magnetic  resonance imaging (fMRI) data that provides correlational evidence for brain regions  involved in a task. However, fMRI cannot differentiate the areas that are  fundamentally required for performing a task. These data can only come from  brain-injured individuals who fail the task after the loss of specific brain areas.  In addition to the lack of complimentary data, is the issue of the variety in the WM  tasks used to assess verbal WM. When different tasks are assumed to measure the same  behavior, this may mask the contributions of different brain regions. Here, we  investigated the neural substrate of WM by using voxel-based lesion symptom mapping  (VLSM) in 49 individuals with stroke-induced left hemisphere brain injuries. These  participants completed two different verbal WM tasks: complex listening span and a  word 2-back task. Behavioral results indicated that the two tasks were only slightly  related, while the VLSM analysis revealed different critical regions associated with  each task. Specifically, significant detriments in performance on the complex span  task were found with lesions in the inferior frontal gyrus, while for the 2-back  task, significant deficits were seen after injury to the superior and middle  temporal gyri. Thus, the two tasks depend on the structural integrity of different,  non-overlapping frontal and temporal brain regions, suggesting distinct neural and  cognitive mechanisms triggered by the two tasks: rehearsal and cue-dependent  selection in the complex span task, versus updating/auditory recognition in the  2-back task. These findings call into question the common practice of using these  two tasks interchangeably in verbal WM research and undermine the legitimacy of  aggregating data from studies with different WM tasks. Thus, the present study  points out the importance of lesion studies in complementing functional neuroimaging  findings and highlights the need to consider task demands in neuroimaging and  neuropsychological investigations of WM.",2018-07-01,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,25-41,NA,,115,NA,Neuropsychologia,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The Val allele of the functional  Val158Met polymorphism of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene is associated  with reduced prefrontal cortex dopamine and exaggerated working memory-related  prefrontal activity. This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study  investigated for the first time whether the COMT Val158Met genotype modulates  prefrontal activity during spatial working memory in BD. METHODS: Sixty-four  outpatients with BD in full or partial remission were stratified according to COMT  Val158Met genotype (ValVal [n=13], ValMet [n=34], and MetMet [n=17]). The patients  completed a spatial n-back working memory task during fMRI and the Cambridge  Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) Spatial Working Memory test  outside the scanner. RESULTS: During high working memory load (2-back vs 1-back),  Val homozygotes displayed decreased activity relative to ValMet individuals, with  Met homozygotes displaying intermediate levels of activity in the right dorsolateral  prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) (P=.016). Exploratory whole-brain analysis revealed a  bilateral decrease in working memory-related dlPFC activity in the ValVal group vs  the ValMet group which was not associated with differences in working memory  performance during fMRI. Outside the MRI scanner, Val carriers performed worse in  the CANTAB Spatial Working Memory task than Met homozygotes (P≤.006), with deficits  being most pronounced in Val homozygotes.

An open question is whether elderly still have the  flexibility to adapt functional network connectivity (FNC) to the demands of the  task at hand. To study this, we collected fMRI data in younger and older  participants during resting state, a selective attention (SA) task and an n-back  working memory task with varying levels of difficulty. Spatial independent component  (IC) analysis was used to identify functional networks over all participants and all  conditions. Dual regression was used to obtain participant and task specific  time-courses per IC. Subsequently, functional connectivity was computed between all  ICs in each of the tasks. Based on these functional connectivity matrices, a scaled  version of the eigenvector centrality (SEC) was used to measure the total influence  of each IC in the complete graph of ICs. The results demonstrated that elderly  remain able to adapt FNC to task demands. However, there was an age-related shift in  the impetus for FNC change. Older participants showed the maximal change in SEC  patterns between resting state and the SA task. Young participants, showed the  largest shift in SEC patterns between the less demanding SA task and the more  demanding 2-back task. Our results suggest that increased FNC changes from resting  state to low demanding tasks in elderly reflect recruitment of additional resources,  compared with young adults.

The present study aims at investigating differences in  working memory performance as well as functional brain changes during the earliest  stages of cognitive decline in health elderly individuals. METHODS: 62 elderly  individuals (41 females), including 41 controls (35 females) and 21 middle cognitive  impairment subjects (6 females), underwent neuropsychological assessment at baseline  and an fMRI examination in a N-back paradigm contrasting 2-back vs. 0-back  condition. Upon a 18 months follow-up, we identified stable controls (sCON) with  preserved cognition and deteriorating controls (dCON) with -1SD decrease of  performances in at least two neuropsychological tests. Data analyses included  accuracy and reaction time (RT) for the 2-back condition and general linear model  (GLM) for the fMRI sequence. RESULTS: At the behavioral level, sCON and dCON  performed better than MCI in terms of accuracy and reaction time. At the brain  level, functional differences in regions of the fronto-parietal network (FPN) and of  the Default Mode Network (DFM) were observed. Significantly lower neural activations  in the bilateral inferior and middle frontal gyri were found in MCI versus both dCON  / sCON and for dCON versus sCON. Significantly increased activations in the anterior  cingulate cortex and posterior cingulate cortex and bilateral insula were found in  MCI versus both dCON / sCON and in dCON versus sCON.

Machine learning algorithms have become a powerful methodology  for evaluating multi-regional areas of fMRI activation that can classify disease  phenotype from sedentary control. Uncovering objective biomarkers such as an fMRI  pattern is important for lending credibility to diagnosis of CFS. fMRI scans were  evaluated for 69 patients (38 CFS and 31 Control) taken before (Day 1) and after  (Day 2) a submaximal exercise test while undergoing the n-back memory paradigm. A  predictive model was created by grouping fMRI voxels into the Automated Anatomical  Labeling (AAL) atlas, splitting the data into a training and testing dataset, and  feeding these inputs into a logistic regression to evaluate differences between CFS  and control. Model results were cross-validated 10 times to ensure accuracy. Model  results were able to differentiate CFS from sedentary controls at a 80% accuracy on  Day 1 and 76% accuracy on Day 2 (Table 3). Recursive features selection identified  29 ROI's that significantly distinguished CFS from control on Day 1 and 28 ROI's on  Day 2 with 10 regions of overlap shared with Day 1 (Figure 3). These 10 shared  regions included the putamen, inferior frontal gyrus, orbital (F3O), supramarginal  gyrus (SMG), temporal pole; superior temporal gyrus (T1P) and caudate ROIs. This  study was able to uncover a pattern of activated neurological regions that  differentiated CFS from Control. This pattern provides a first step toward  developing fMRI as a diagnostic biomarker and suggests this methodology could be  emulated for other disorders.

The ideal target range  of blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in adults outside pregnancy is a matter of  debate. Therefore, prospective intervention studies are needed to evaluate the  effects of an elevated Phe concentration on cognition and structural, functional,  and neurometabolic parameters of the brain. METHODS: The PICO (Phenylalanine and Its  Impact on Cognition) Study evaluates the effect of a 4-week Phe load on cognition  and cerebral parameters in adults with early-treated PKU in a double-blind,  randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover, noninferiority trial. PARTICIPANTS:  Thirty adult patients with early-treated PKU and 30 healthy controls comparable to  patients with regard to age, sex, and educational level will be recruited from the  University Hospitals Bern and Zurich, Switzerland. Patients are eligible for the  study if they are 18 years of age or older and had PKU diagnosed after a positive  newborn screening and were treated with a Phe-restricted diet starting within the  first 30 days of life. INTERVENTION: The cross-over intervention consists of 4-week  oral Phe or placebo administration in patients with PKU. The study design mimics a  Phe-restricted and a Phe-unrestricted diet using a double-blinded,  placebo-controlled approach. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the PICO Study is  to prospectively assess whether a temporarily elevated Phe level influences  cognitive performance (working memory assessed with a n-back task) in adults with  early-treated PKU. As a secondary objective, the PICO Study will elucidate the  cerebral (fMRI, neural activation during a n-back task; rsfMRI, functional  connectivity at rest; DTI, white matter integrity; and ASL, cerebral blood flow) and  neurometabolic mechanisms (cerebral Phe level) that accompany changes in Phe  concentration. Cognition, and structural and functional parameters of the brain of  adult patients with early-treated PKU will be cross-sectionally compared to healthy  controls. All assessments will take place at the University Hospital Bern,  Switzerland. RANDOMIZATION: Central randomization will be used to assign  participants to the different treatment arms with age, sex, and center serving as  the stratification factors. Randomization lists will be generated by an independent  statistician. Blinding: All trial personnel other than the statistician generating  the randomization list and the personnel at the facility preparing the  interventional product are blinded to the assigned treatment. DISCUSSION: Using a  combination of neuropsychological and neuroimaging data, the PICO Study will  considerably contribute to improve the currently insufficient level of evidence on  how adult patients with early-treated PKU should be managed.

Increased  WM load will increase the amount and difficulty of memory information. Several  studies have used electroencephalography (EEG) or functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI) to explore load-dependent cognition processing according to the time  courses of electrophysiological activity or the spatial pattern of blood oxygen  metabolic activity. However, the relationships between these two activities and the  underlying neural mechanism are still unclear. In this study, using simultaneously  collected EEG and fMRI data under an n-back verbal WM task, we modeled the spectral  perturbation of EEG oscillation and fMRI activation through joint independent  component analysis (JICA). Multi-channel oscillation features were also introduced  into the JICA model for further analysis. The results showed that time-locked  activity of theta and beta were modulated by memory load in the early stimuli  evaluation stage, corresponding to the enhanced activation in the frontal and  parietal lobe, which were involved in stimulus discrimination, information encoding  and delay-period activity. In the late response selection stage, alpha and gamma  activity changes dependent on the load correspond to enhanced activation in the  areas of frontal, temporal and parietal lobes, which played important roles in  attention, information extraction and memory retention. These findings suggest that  the increases in memory load not only affect the intensity and time course of the  EEG activities, but also lead to the enhanced activation of brain regions which  plays different roles during different time periods of cognitive process of WM.",2017,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,215,NA,,11,NA,Front Behav Neurosci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 29163087  PMCID: PMC5671635,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/ZJA7HIL8/Zhao et al. - 2017 - Localized Fluctuant Oscillatory Activity by Workin.pdf,NA,fMRI; event-related spectral perturbation; joint independent component analysis; memory load; oscillation,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Zhao et al. - 2017 - Localized Fluctuant Oscillatory Activity by Workin.pdf

This exploratory study aimed to assess whether the cognitive impairment in  non-manifesting carriers is specific for executive functions or includes other  cognitive domains such as working memory. We recruited 77 non-manifesting  first-degree relatives of Parkinson's disease patients (38 carriers).

Erythropoietin (EPO) increases  neuroplasticity and may improve cognition in mood disorders, but the neuronal  mechanisms of these effects are unknown. This functional magnetic resonance imaging  (fMRI) study investigated the effects of EPO on neural circuitry activity during  working memory (WM) performance. METHOD: Patients with treatment-resistant major  depression, who were moderately depressed, or with BD in partial remission, were  randomized to eight weekly infusions of EPO (40 000 IU) (N = 30) or saline (N = 26)  in a double-blind, parallel-group design. Patients underwent fMRI, mood ratings and  blood tests at baseline and week 14. During fMRI patients performed an n-back WM  task. RESULTS: EPO improved WM accuracy compared with saline (p = 0.045).  Whole-brain analyses revealed that EPO increased WM load-related activity in the  right superior frontal gyrus (SFG) compared with saline (p = 0.01). There was also  enhanced WM load-related deactivation of the left hippocampus in EPO-treated  compared to saline-treated patients (p = 0.03).

Post hoc comparisons revealed that this effect was driven by the SCZ  relatives, who showed a significant increase in the negative functional connectivity  of the DLPFC and right hippocampus compared to controls (PFWE = .001), BD relatives  (PFWE = .015) and trend-wise also MDD relatives (PFWE = .082). Comparison of BD and  MDD relatives to the controls revealed no difference (PFWE-values > .451).  Supplementary analyses suggested that the SCZ relatives finding is robust to a range  of potential confounds, including structural differences. Our data further support  altered DLPFC-hippocampus connectivity during working memory as an intermediate  phenotype for SCZ. This suggests that this phenotype is relatively specific to SCZ  and does not translate to other genetically related disorders in the mood-psychosis  spectrum.",2017-09-01,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,1114-1122,NA,5,43,NA,Schizophr Bull,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,"© The Author 2017.

However, recent evidence suggests greater DMN  activity in an array of tasks, especially those that involve self-referential and  memory-based processing. Although data that robustly demonstrate a comprehensive  functional role for DMN remains relatively scarce, the global workspace framework,  which implicates the DMN in global information integration for conscious processing,  can potentially provide an explanation for the broad range of higher-order paradigms  that report DMN involvement. We used graph theoretical measures to assess the  contribution of the DMN to global functional connectivity dynamics in 22 healthy  volunteers during an fMRI-based n-back working-memory paradigm with parametric  increases in difficulty. Our predominant finding is that brain modularity decreases  with greater task demands, thus adapting a more global workspace configuration, in  direct relation to increases in reaction times to correct responses. Flexible  default mode regions dynamically switch community memberships and display  significant changes in their nodal participation coefficient and strength, which may  reflect the observed whole-brain changes in functional connectivity architecture.  These findings have important implications for our understanding of healthy brain  function, as they suggest a central role for the DMN in higher cognitive processing.  SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The default mode network (DMN) has been shown to increase  its activity during the absence of external stimulation, and hence was historically  assumed to disengage during goal-directed tasks. Recent evidence, however,  implicates the DMN in self-referential and memory-based processing. We provide  robust evidence for this network's active contribution to working memory by  revealing dynamic reconfiguration in its interactions with other networks and offer  an explanation within the global workspace theoretical framework. These promising  findings may help redefine our understanding of the exact DMN role in human  cognition.",2015-11-18,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,15254-15262,NA,46,35,NA,J Neurosci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,Copyright © 2015 Vatansever et al.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 26586814  PMCID: PMC4649001,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/ZEAS9XYQ/Vatansever et al. - 2015 - Default Mode Dynamics for Global Functional Integr.pdf,NA,"Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; *Brain Mapping; Cognition/*physiology; default mode network; Healthy Volunteers; Linear Models; Brain/blood supply/*physiology; functional connectivity; graph theory; *Models, Neurological; *Nonlinear Dynamics; alluvial diagram; flexibility; large-scale brain network; Nerve Net/blood supply/physiology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Vatansever et al. - 2015 - Default Mode Dynamics for Global Functional Integr.pdf

Working-memory (a central executive function) may be a powerful  predictor of the course of drug use and drug-related problems. Goal of the current  functional magnetic resonance imaging study was to assess the predictive power of  working-memory network function for future cannabis use and cannabis-related problem  severity in heavy cannabis users. Tensor independent component analysis was used to  investigate differences in working-memory network function between 32 heavy cannabis  users and 41 nonusing controls during an N-back working-memory task. In addition,  associations were examined between working-memory network function and cannabis use  and problem severity at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. Behavioral performance  and working-memory network function did not significantly differ between heavy  cannabis users and controls. However, among heavy cannabis users, individual  differences in working-memory network response had an independent effect on change  in weekly cannabis use 6 months later (ΔR(2) = 0.11, P = 0.006, f(2) = 0.37) beyond  baseline cannabis use (ΔR(2) = 0.41) and a behavioral measure of approach bias  (ΔR(2) = 0.18): a stronger network response during the N-back task was related to an  increase in weekly cannabis use.

This study compares an fMRI paradigm involving motor skills,  working memory, and executive function in SLE patients without antiphospholipid  antibody (aPL) (the SLE group), aPL-positive non-SLE patients (the aPL-positive  group), and controls. METHODS: Brain MRI, fMRI, and standardized cognitive  assessment results were obtained from 20 SLE, 20 aPL-positive, and 10 healthy female  subjects with no history of neuropsychiatric abnormality. RESULTS: Analysis of fMRI  data showed no differences in performance across groups on bilateral motor tasks.  When analysis of variance was used, significant group differences were found in 2  executive function tasks (word generation and word rhyming) and in a working memory  task (N-Back). Patients positive for aPL demonstrated higher activation in bilateral  frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices compared to controls during working memory  and executive function tasks. SLE patients also demonstrated bilateral frontal and  temporal activation during working memory and executive function tasks.

OBJECTIVES: We sought to  replicate the association of the COMT val allele with abstinence-induced alterations  in working memory-related activity in task-positive (executive control) and  task-negative (default mode network) regions. METHODS: Forty smokers (20 val/val and  20 met/met) performed an N-back task while undergoing blood oxygen level-dependent  (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on two separate occasions:  following 72 h of confirmed abstinence and during smoking as usual. An independent  sample of 48 smokers who completed the identical N-back task during fMRI in smoking  vs. abstinence for another study was used as a validation sample. RESULTS: Contrary  to expectations, genotype by session interactions on BOLD signal in executive  control regions (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and dorsal cingulate/medial  prefrontal cortex) revealed significant abstinence-induced reductions in the met/met  group, but not the val/val group. Results also revealed that val/val smokers may  exhibit less suppression of activation in task-negative regions such as the  posterior cingulate cortex during abstinence (vs. smoking).

Studies in animals demonstrate an interaction between dopamine D2 receptors and nicotinic  acetylcholine receptors on prefrontal behavior but evidence in humans is weak.  Therefore, we hypothesize that genetic variation regulating dopamine D2 and  nicotinic acetylcholine receptor signaling impact prefrontal cortex activity and  related cognition. To test this hypothesis in humans, we explored the interaction  between functional genetic variants in the D2 receptor gene (DRD2, rs1076560) and in  the nicotinic receptor α5 gene (CHRNA5, rs16969968) on both dorsolateral prefrontal  cortex mediated behavior and physiology during working memory and on prefrontal gray  matter volume.

Here we report voxel-by-voxel genetic model fitting in a large sample of 319  healthy, young adult, human identical and fraternal twins (mean ± SD age, 23.6 ± 1.8  years) who performed an n-back working memory task during functional magnetic  resonance imaging (fMRI) at a high magnetic field (4 tesla). Patterns of  task-related brain response (BOLD signal difference of 2-back minus 0-back) were  significantly heritable, with the highest estimates (40-65%) in the inferior,  middle, and superior frontal gyri, left supplementary motor area, precentral and  postcentral gyri, middle cingulate cortex, superior medial gyrus, angular gyrus,  superior parietal lobule, including precuneus, and superior occipital gyri.  Furthermore, high test-retest reliability for a subsample of 40 twins indicates that  nongenetic variance in the fMRI brain response is largely due to unique  environmental influences rather than measurement error. Individual variations in  activation of the working memory network are therefore significantly influenced by  genetic factors. By establishing the heritability of cognitive brain function in a  large sample that affords good statistical power, and using voxel-by-voxel analyses,  this study provides the necessary evidence for task-related brain activation to be  considered as an endophenotype for psychiatric or neurological disorders, and  represents a substantial new contribution to the field of neuroimaging genetics.

However, the  neural correlates of this difference have not yet been investigated. In this study,  we focused on working memory (WM) for typical complex cognitive processes.  Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired during the performance of  an N-back task, which is a measure of WM for typical complex cognitive processes. In  our N-back task, task speed and memory load were varied to identify the neural  correlates responsible for the difference between the speed of simple cognitive  processes (estimated from the 0-back task) and the speed of WM. Our findings showed  that this difference was characterized by the increased activation in the right  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the increased functional interaction  between the right DLPFC and right superior parietal lobe. Furthermore, the local  gray matter volume of the right DLPFC was correlated with participants' accuracy  during fast WM tasks, which in turn correlated with a psychometric measure of  participants' intelligence. Our findings indicate that the right DLPFC and its  related network are responsible for the execution of the fast cognitive processes  involved in WM.

Here we sought to  replicate this nonlinear effect in the same sample using a different functional  paradigm to test the generalizability of this phenomenon. Participants (N = 68  healthy adults aged 49-94) underwent fMRI (0-, 2-, 3-, 4-back working memory task;  WM) and (18)F-Florbetapir PET scanning. A parametric WM load contrast was used as  the dependent variable in a model with age, mean cortical Aβ, and Aβ(2) as  predictors. Results revealed that nonlinear amyloid (Aβ(2)) was a significant  negative predictor of modulation of activation to WM load in two large inferior  clusters: bilateral subcortical nuclei and bilateral lateral cerebellum. Individuals  with slightly elevated Aβ burden evidenced greater modulation as compared to  individuals with little or no Aβ burden, whereas individuals with the greatest Aβ  burden evidenced lesser modulation as compared to individuals with slightly elevated  Aβ. Increased modulation to WM load predicted better task accuracy and executive  function measured outside the scanner.

We investigate  the working memory (WM) function of patients with untreated obstructive sleep apnea  (OSA) from the view point of task positive and default mode networks (TPN and DMN,  respectively) and compare the results to those of healthy controls (HC). METHODS: A  parametric fMRI experiment with 4 levels of visuospatial N-back task was used to  investigate the pattern of cortical activation in 17 men with untreated moderate or  severe OSA and 7 age-matched HC. Categorical and parametrical analysis of the data  was performed. Multiple regression analysis of fMRI data of OSA patients was  performed with AHI, nocturnal desaturation time, and BMI as covariates. RESULTS: OSA  patients demonstrate compensatory spatial recruitment of the TPN (maximal at 3-back)  and of the DMN (maximal at 2-back). HC had a different patten of spatial recruitment  and deactivation of the DMN at the maximal load of task (3-back). Nocturnal  desaturation had significant positive correlation with BOLD signal in bilateral  frontal, temporal, and occipital regions, and negative correlations in bilateral  frontal and left parietal regions; whereas BMI showed only negative correlations  with BOLD signal, predominantly in the PFC. AHI was positively correlated with BOLD  signal in bilateral frontal regions.

Subjects were fitted with the fNIRS cap consisting of 30 'optodes'  positioned over the forehead. The results revealed different patterns of brain  activation in MS and HCs. The MS group showed an increase in brain activation, as  measured by the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyHb), in the left superior  frontal gyrus (LSFG) at lower task difficulty levels (i.e. 1-back), followed by a  decrease at higher task difficulty (2- and 3-back) as compared with the HC group.

However, how estrogen loss and subsequent estrogen treatment affects  cognition and particularly the underlying brain processes responsible for any  cognitive changes is less well understood. We examined the ability of estradiol to  modulate the manipulation of information in working memory and related brain  activation in postmenopausal women. Twenty healthy postmenopausal women (mean age  (SD)=59.13 (5.5)) were randomly assigned to three months of 1mg oral 17-β estradiol  or placebo. At baseline and three months later each woman completed a visual verbal  N-back sequential letter test of working memory during functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI). The fMRI data showed that women who were treated with estradiol for  three months had increased frontal activation during the more difficult working  memory load conditions compared to women treated with placebo. Performance on the  verbal working memory task showed no difference between estradiol and placebo  treated subjects. These data are consistent with prior work showing increases in  frontal activation on memory tasks after estrogen treatment. However, this is the  first study to show that estrogen-induced increases in brain activity were tied to  cognitive load during a verbal working memory task.

The reproducibility of regional activations in  key regions for working memory (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC; hippocampal  formation, HF) was evaluated using conjunction analyses across locations. These  analyses showed consistent activation of right DLPFC and deactivation of left HF  across all three different sites. The effective connectivity between DLPFC and HF  was analyzed using a simple two-region sDCM. For each subject, we evaluated  sixty-seven alternative sDCMs and compared their relative plausibility using  Bayesian model selection (BMS). Across all locations, BMS consistently revealed the  same winning model, with the 2-Back working memory condition as driving input to  both DLPFC and HF and with a connection from DLPFC to HF.

METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 20 subjects with MS who smoked cannabis and 19  noncannabis users with MS, matched on demographic and neurologic variables,  underwent fMRI while completing a test of working memory, the N-Back. Resting-state  fMRI and structural MRI data (lesion and normal-appearing brain tissue volumes,  diffusion tensor imaging metrics) were also collected. Neuropsychological data  pertaining to verbal (Selective Reminding Test Revised) and visual (10/36 Spatial  Recall Test) memory, information processing speed (Paced Auditory Serial Addition  Test [2- and 3-second versions] and Symbol Digit Modalities Test), and attention  (Word List Generation) were obtained. RESULTS: The cannabis group performed more  poorly on the more demanding of the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test tasks (i.e.,  2-second version) (p < 0.02) and the 10/36 Spatial Recall Test (p < 0.03).

High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is  a noninvasive tool to increase local excitability of neurons and induce short-time  functional reorganization of cortical networks. While this has been shown for the  motor system, little is known about the short-term plasticity of networks for  executive cognition in humans. We examined 12 healthy control subjects in a  crossover study with fMRI after real and sham 5 Hz rTMS to the right dorsolateral  prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). During scanning, subjects performed an n-back working  memory (WM) task and a flanker task engaging cognitive control. Reaction times  during the n-back task were significantly shorter after rTMS than after sham  stimulation. RTMS compared with sham stimulation caused no activation changes at the  stimulation site (right DLPFC) itself, but significantly increased connectivity  within the WM network during n-back and reduced activation in the anterior cingulate  cortex during the flanker task. Reduced reaction times after real stimulation  support an excitatory effect of high-frequency rTMS. Our findings identified plastic  changes in prefrontally connected networks downstream of the stimulation site as the  substrate of this behavioral effect.

Participants were grouped into 105  monozygotic twin, 78 dizygotic twin, 99 nontwin sibling, and 100 unrelated pairs.  Activation pattern similarity was used to test the hypothesis that FrontoParietal  regions would have higher similarity for same load conditions, while Visual regions  would have higher similarity in same perceptual category conditions. Results  confirmed this highly robust regional double dissociation in neural coding, which  also predicted individual differences in behavioral performance. In pair-based  analyses, anatomically selective genetic relatedness effects were observed:  relatedness predicted greater activation pattern similarity in FrontoParietal only  for load coding and in Visual only for perceptual coding. Further, in related pairs,  the similarity of load coding in FrontoParietal regions was uniquely associated with  behavioral performance.

A.",Angular default mode network connectivity across working memory load.,Human brain mapping,NA,1097-0193 1065-9471,10.1002/hbm.23341,NA,"Initially identified during no-task, baseline conditions, it has now been suggested that the default mode network (DMN) engages during a variety of working memory  paradigms through its flexible interactions with other large-scale brain networks.  Nevertheless, its contribution to whole-brain connectivity dynamics across  increasing working memory load has not been explicitly assessed. The aim of our  study was to determine which DMN hubs relate to working memory task performance  during an fMRI-based n-back paradigm with parametric increases in difficulty. Using  a voxel-wise metric, termed the intrinsic connectivity contrast (ICC), we found that  the bilateral angular gyri (core DMN hubs) displayed the greatest change in global  connectivity across three levels of n-back task load. Subsequent seed-based  functional connectivity analysis revealed that the angular DMN regions robustly  interact with other large-scale brain networks, suggesting a potential involvement  in the global integration of information. Further support for this hypothesis comes  from the significant correlations we found between angular gyri connectivity and  reaction times to correct responses. The implication from our study is that the DMN  is actively involved during the n-back task and thus plays an important role related  to working memory, with its core angular regions contributing to the changes in  global brain connectivity in response to increasing environmental demands.

RESULTS: VSG adolescents lost weight, while WL  gained weight and HC did not change between time points. Gains in executive and  reward-related performance were larger in VSG than control groups.

Surprisingly,  little is known about the neural mechanisms that support this form of memory, termed  time-based prospective memory (PM). Here we pioneer an fMRI paradigm that enables  examination of both sustained and transient processes engaged during time-based PM.  Participants were scanned while performing a demanding on-going task (n-back working  memory), with and without an additional time-based PM demand. During the PM  condition participants could access a hidden clock with a specific button-press  response, while in the control condition, pseudo-clocks randomly appeared and were  removed via the same response. Analyses tested for sustained activation associated  with the PM condition, and also transient activation associated with clock-checks  and the PM target response. Contrary to prior findings with event-based PM (i.e.,  remembering to perform a future action when a specific event occurs), no sustained  PM-related activity was observed in anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) or elsewhere  in the brain; instead, transient clock-related activity was observed in this region.  Critically, the activation was anticipatory, increasing before clock-check  responses. Anticipatory activity prior to the PM target response was weaker in aPFC,  but strong in pre-Supplementary Motor Area (pre-SMA; relative to clock-check  responses), suggesting a functional double dissociation related to volitional  decision-making. Together, the results suggest that aPFC-activity dynamics during  time-based PM reflect a distinct transient monitoring process, enabling integration  of the PM intention with current temporal information to facilitate scheduling of  upcoming PM-related actions.",2014,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,e92123,NA,3,9,NA,PLoS One,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 24643226  PMCID: PMC3958452,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/VY9VMKH4/Oksanen et al. - 2014 - Neural mechanisms of time-based prospective memory.pdf,NA,"Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Time Factors; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Reaction Time; Cognition/*physiology; Memory, Short-Term/physiology; *Memory, Episodic; Attention/physiology; Delay Discounting/physiology; Prefrontal Cortex/anatomy & histology/*physiology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Oksanen et al. - 2014 - Neural mechanisms of time-based prospective memory.pdf

DESIGN: Randomized,  double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Academic medical center.  PARTICIPANTS: Healthy older adults (62-80 years) with subjective memory impairment,  but not meeting criteria for mild cognitive impairment or dementia. INTERVENTION:  Fish oil (EPA+DHA: 2.4 g/d, n=11) or placebo (corn oil, n=10) for 24 weeks.  MEASUREMENTS: Cortical BOLD response patterns during performance of a sequential  letter n-back working memory task were determined at baseline and week 24 by  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). RESULTS: At 24 weeks erythrocyte  membrane EPA+DHA composition increased significantly from baseline in participants  receiving fish oil (+31%, p ≤ 0.0001) but not placebo (-17%, p=0.06). Multivariate  modeling of fMRI data identified a significant interaction among treatment, visit,  and memory loading in the right cingulate (BA 23/24), and in the right sensorimotor  area (BA 3/4). In the fish oil group, BOLD increases at 24 weeks were observed in  the right posterior cingulate and left superior frontal regions during memory  loading. A region-of-interest analysis indicated that the baseline to endpoint  change in posterior cingulate cortex BOLD activity signal was significantly greater  in the fish oil group compared with the placebo group during the 1-back (p=0.0003)  and 2-back (p=0.0005) conditions. Among all participants, the change in erythrocyte  EPA+DHA during the intervention was associated with performance in the 2-back  working memory task (p = 0.01), and with cingulate BOLD signal during the 1-back (p  = 0.005) with a trend during the 2-back (p = 0.09). Further, cingulate BOLD activity  was related to performance in the 2-back condition.

Social threat impaired WM performance during an  N-back task and produced widespread reductions in activation in lateral prefrontal  cortex and intraparietal sulcus (IPS), among other regions. In addition, activity in  frontal and parietal regions predicted WM performance, and mediation analyses  identified regions in the bilateral IPS that mediated the performance-impairing  effects of social threat. Social threat also decreased connectivity between the IPS  and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, while increasing connectivity between the IPS  and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a region strongly implicated in the  generation of autonomic and emotional responses.

However,  these studies have often failed to consider the potential role of task-related  deactivation. METHOD: Thirty-two patients with chronic schizophrenia and 32 age- and  sex-matched normal controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)  scanning while performing baseline, 1-back and 2-back versions of the n-back task.  Linear models were used to obtain maps of activations and deactivations in the  groups. RESULTS: The controls showed activation in the expected frontal regions.  There were also clusters of deactivation, particularly in the anterior  cingulate/ventromedial PFC and the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus. Compared to  the controls, the schizophrenic patients showed reduced activation in the right  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and other frontal areas. There was also an  area in the anterior cingulate/ventromedial PFC where the patients showed apparently  greater activation than the controls. This represented a failure of deactivation in  the schizophrenic patients. Failure to activate was a function of the patients'  impaired performance on the n-back task, whereas the failure to deactivate was less  performance dependent. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with schizophrenia show both failure to  activate and failure to deactivate during performance of a working memory task. The  area of failure of deactivation is in the anterior prefrontal/anterior cingulate  cortex and corresponds to one of the two midline components of the 'default mode  network' implicated in functions related to maintaining one's sense of self.",Aug-08,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,1185-1193,NA,8,38,NA,Psychol Med,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: England PMID: 18507885,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/KL9NHIH9/Pomarol-Clotet et al. - 2008 - Failure to deactivate in the prefrontal cortex in .pdf,NA,Humans; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Middle Aged; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Prefrontal Cortex/*physiopathology; Nerve Net/*physiopathology; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Memory Disorders/diagnosis/epidemiology/physiopathology; Schizophrenia/diagnosis/epidemiology/*physiopathology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Pomarol-Clotet et al. - 2008 - Failure to deactivate in the prefrontal cortex in .pdf

Aging adults from low-income households are  individuals with a high risk of cognitive decline who incorporate ulam in their  daily diet. PURPOSE: To examine relationship between ulam consumption and the  working memory and cognitive flexibility among aging adults from low-income  households who are more susceptible to cognitive decline. STUDY TYPE:  Cross-sectional. POPULATION/SUBJECTS: Thirty-two aging adults (45-75 years old).  FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: Task-based fMRI, 3.0T, T(1) -weighted anatomical images,  T(2) *-weighted imaging data. ASSESSMENT: The dietary and ulam consumption were  assessed using the respective validated Dietary History and semiquantitative Food  Frequency questionnaires. Working memory and cognitive flexibility were evaluated by  using neuropsychological batteries (ie, mini-mental state examination [MMSE], Digit  Span, and Rey auditory verbal learning test [RAVLT]) and task-based fMRI (N-back and  Stroop Color Word Test [SCWT]). Brodmann's areas 9 and 46 were the regions of  interest (ROIs) of DLPFC activation. STATISTICAL TESTS: Multiple linear regression  used to understand the relationship between ulam consumption and the working memory  and cognitive flexibility, while analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare  the difference of working memory and cognitive flexibility among four percentiles of  ulam consumption, after age, gender, and education years adjustments. Significance  was decided by two-sided, P < 0.0042 and P < 0.05. RESULTS: The multiple linear  regression revealed that ulam consumption was positively associated with the Digit  Span (R(2) = 0.51, β = 0.702, P < 0.001), right DLPFC activation (1-back) (R(2) =  0.34, β = 0.591, P = 0.001), left DLPFC activation (SCWT-1) (R(2) = 0.33, β = 0.553,  P = 0.002), and left DLPFC activation (SCWT-2) (R(2) = 0.34, β = 0.497, P = 0.004).  The ulam consumption at the 75(th) and 100(th) percentile from the ANCOVA analysis  had shown a better working memory and cognitive flexibility as compared with those  of the 25(th) and 50(th) percentiles (P < 0.05). DATA CONCLUSION: This study found  that high ulam consumption was related to a high intensity of brain activation in  DLPFC; however, the elucidation of the neuroprotective properties of ulam have yet  to be established from clinical trial studies.

In particular, activity in posterior parietal and medial prefrontal  areas has been found to be modulated by preceding experimental conditions. In this  study, we investigated which brain areas show working memory dependent patterns in  subsequent baseline periods and how specific they are for the preceding experimental  condition. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, 94 subjects performed a  letter-version of the n-back task with the conditions 0-back and 2-back followed by  a low-level baseline in which subjects had to passively observe the letters  appearing. In a univariate analysis, 2-back served as control condition while  0-back, baseline after 0-back and baseline after 2-back were modeled as regressors  to test for activity changes between both baseline conditions. Additionally, we  tested, using Gaussian process classifiers, the recognition of task condition from  functional images acquired during baseline.

However, studies with adult attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder  patients addressing this issue as well as the effects of clinically valid  methylphenidate treatment are scarce. This study contributes to closing this gap.  METHODS: Thirty-five adult patients were randomized to 6 weeks of double-blind  placebo or methylphenidate treatment. Patients completed an fMRI n-back working  memory task both before and after the assigned treatment, and matched healthy  controls were tested and compared to the untreated patients. RESULTS: There were no  whole-brain differences between any of the groups. However, when specified regions  of interest were investigated, the patient group showed enhanced BOLD responses in  dorsal and ventral areas before treatment. This increase was correlated with  performance across all participants and with attention deficit/hyperactivity  disorder symptoms in the patient group. Furthermore, we found an effect of treatment  in the right superior frontal gyrus, with methylphenidate-treated patients  exhibiting increased activation, which was absent in the placebo-treated patients.  CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate distinct activation differences between untreated  adult attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder patients and matched healthy controls  during a working memory task. These differences might reflect compensatory efforts  by the patients, who are performing at the same level as the healthy controls. We  furthermore found a positive effect of methylphenidate on the activation of a  frontal region of interest. These observations contribute to a more thorough  understanding of adult attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and provide impulses  for the evaluation of therapy-related changes.",2016-05-06,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,pyw049,NA,10,19,NA,Int J Neuropsychopharmacol,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,© The Author 2016.

Overall, both WM conditions (1-BACK and 2-BACK)  activated a large network of regions throughout the brain, common to all groups.  However, voxel-wise and time-course analyses revealed significant functional group  differences, despite no significant behavioral performance differences. During  1-BACK, voxel-wise blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal activity was  significantly reduced in a number of regions from the WM network (inferior frontal  gyrus, anterior insula, caudate, putamen, and cerebellum) in pre-HD and symp-HD  groups, compared with controls; however, time-course analysis of the BOLD response  in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) showed increased activation in  symp-HD, compared with pre-HD and controls. The pattern of reduced voxel-wise BOLD  activity in pre-HD and symp-HD, relative to controls, became more pervasive during  2-BACK affecting the same structures as in 1-BACK, but also incorporated further WM  regions (anterior cingulate gyrus, parietal lobe and thalamus). The DLPFC BOLD  time-course for 2-BACK showed a reversed pattern to that observed in 1-BACK, with a  significantly diminished signal in symp-HD, relative to pre-HD and controls. Our  findings provide support for functional brain reorganisation in cortical and  subcortical regions in both pre-HD and symp-HD, which are modulated by task  difficulty.

The performance characteristics of the fMRI paradigm constrain experimental  power and may require different study designs (e.g., crossover vs. parallel groups),  yet fMRI reliability characteristics can be strongly dependent on the nature of the  fMRI task. The present study investigated both within-subject and group-level  reliability of a combined three-task fMRI battery targeting three systems of wide  applicability in clinical and cognitive neuroscience: an emotional (face matching),  a motivational (monetary reward anticipation) and a cognitive (n-back working  memory) task. A group of 25 young, healthy volunteers were scanned twice on a 3T MRI  scanner with a mean test-retest interval of 14.6 days. FMRI reliability was  quantified using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) applied at three  different levels ranging from a global to a localized and fine spatial scale: (1)  reliability of group-level activation maps over the whole brain and within targeted  regions of interest (ROIs); (2) within-subject reliability of ROI-mean amplitudes  and (3) within-subject reliability of individual voxels in the target ROIs. Results  showed robust evoked activation of all three tasks in their respective target  regions (emotional task=amygdala; motivational task=ventral striatum; cognitive  task=right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and parietal cortices) with high effect  sizes (ES) of ROI-mean summary values (ES=1.11-1.44 for the faces task, 0.96-1.43  for the reward task, 0.83-2.58 for the n-back task). Reliability of group level  activation was excellent for all three tasks with ICCs of 0.89-0.98 at the whole  brain level and 0.66-0.97 within target ROIs. Within-subject reliability of ROI-mean  amplitudes across sessions was fair to good for the reward task (ICCs=0.56-0.62)  and, dependent on the particular ROI, also fair-to-good for the n-back task  (ICCs=0.44-0.57) but lower for the faces task (ICC=-0.02-0.16). In conclusion, all  three tasks are well suited to between-subject designs, including imaging genetics.  When specific recommendations are followed, the n-back and reward task are also  suited for within-subject designs, including pharmaco-fMRI.

We used a visuo-spatial 'n-back' paradigm to  compare WM network activity in 38 unilateral hippocampal sclerosis (HS) patients (19  left) and 15 healthy controls. WM performance was impaired in both left and right HS  groups compared to controls. The TLE groups showed reduced right superior parietal  lobe activity during single- and multiple-item WM.

We  examined whether functional anatomy underlying working memory, a component process  of executive function, differed by DAT1 in 7-12 year-old typically developing  children. 10/10 and 9/10 carriers performed a verbal n-back task in two functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) runs varying in working memory load, high (2-back  vs. 1-back) and low (1-back vs. 0-back).

Examination of each run  separately revealed that frontal-striatal-parietal regions were more activated in  9/10 than 10/10 carriers in the high load run; the groups did not differ in the low  load run. Examination of load effects revealed a DAT1xLoad interaction in the right  hemisphere in the caudate, our a priori region of interest. Exploratory analysis at  a more liberal threshold revealed this interaction in other basal ganglia regions  (putamen, and substantial nigra/subthalamic nuclei - SN/STN) and in medial parietal  cortex (left precuneus). The striatal and parietal regions were more activated in  9/10 carriers under high than low load, and DAT1 differences (9/10>10/10) were  evident only under high load. In contrast, SN/STN tended to be more activated in  10/10 carriers under low than high load and DAT1 differences (10/10>9/10) were  evident only under low load.

Furthermore, its signaling appears to affect brain cognitive processing. Recent  findings highlight a crucial role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the mechanism of  intraneuronal CB1 signaling transduction, while others indicate that two single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs1406977 and rs20417) modulate expression of CB1  (CNR1) and COX-2 (PTGS2) coding genes, respectively. Here, our aim was to use fMRI  to investigate in healthy humans whether these SNPs interact in modulating  prefrontal activity during working memory processing and if this modulation is  linked with cannabis use. We recruited 242 healthy subjects genotyped for CNR1  rs1406977 and PTGS2 rs20417 that performed the N-back working memory task during  fMRI and were interviewed using the Cannabis Experience Questionnaire (CEQ). We  found that the interaction between CNR1 rs1406977 and PTGS2 rs20417 is associated  with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity such that specific genotype  configurations (CNR1 C carriers/PTGS2 C carriers and CNR1 TT/PTGS2 GG) predict lower  cortical response versus others in spite of similar behavioral accuracy.  Furthermore, DLPFC activity in the cluster associated with the CNR1 by PTGS2  interaction was negatively correlated with behavioral efficiency and positively  correlated with frequency of cannabis use in cannabis users. These results suggest  that a genetically modulated balancing of signaling within the CB1-COX-2 pathway may  reflect on more or less efficient patterns of prefrontal activity during working  memory. Frequency of cannabis use may be a factor for further modulation of  CNR1/PTGS2-mediated cortical processing associated with this cognitive process.",Aug-16,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,231-238,NA,,81,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may be an additional, more objective tool to  assess the severity and recovery of function after concussion. The purpose of this  study was to define neural correlates of SRC during the 2 months after injury in  varsity contact sport athletes who suffered a SRC. All athletes were scanned as they  performed an n-back task, for n=1, 2, 3. Subjects were scanned within 72 hours  (session one), at 2 weeks (session two), and 2 months (session three) post-injury.

Measures of task  performance revealed no significant differences between concussed versus control  groups at any of the three time points with respect to any of the three n-back  tasks. These findings suggest that functional brain activation differences persist  at 2 months after injury in concussed athletes, despite the fact that their  performance on a standard working memory task is comparable to normal controls and  normalization of clinical and NP test results.

This study investigates working memory deficits in children with TLE by assessing  deactivation of the default mode network (DMN) on functional Magnetic Resonance  Imaging (fMRI) and the relationship of DMN deactivation with fMRI behavioral  findings and neuropsychological test performance. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: fMRI was  conducted on 15 children with TLE and 15 healthy controls (age: 8-16 years) while  performing the N-back task in order to assess deactivation of the DMN. N-back  accuracy, N-back reaction time, and neuropsychological tests of executive function  (Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System [D-KEFS] Color-Word Interference and Card  Sort tests) were also assessed. PRINCIPAL OBSERVATIONS: During the N-back task,  children with TLE exhibited significantly less deactivation of the DMN, primarily in  the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex compared with controls. These alterations  significantly correlated with N-back behavioral findings and D-KEFS results.  CONCLUSIONS: Children with TLE exhibit executive dysfunction which correlates with  DMN alterations. These findings suggest that the level of deactivation of specific  functional networks may contribute to cognitive impairment in children with TLE.

Studies of functional connectivity have been instrumental in  extending such notions to humans but, so far, have almost exclusively focussed on  pharmacological agents with a predominant dopaminergic mechanism of action. Here, we  investigate the effect of a single dose of atomoxetine 60mg, a noradrenaline  transporter inhibitor, on working memory performance and associated functional  connectivity during an n-back task in 19 healthy male volunteers. Atomoxetine  increased functional connectivity between right anterior insula and dorsolateral  prefrontal cortex, precentral gyrus, posterior parietal cortex and precuneus during  the high-working memory load condition of the n-back task. Increased  atomoxetine-induced insula-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex functional connectivity  during this condition correlated with decreased reaction time variability and was  furthermore predicted by working memory capacity. These results show for the first  time that noradrenaline transporter blockade-induced increases in cortical  catecholamines accentuate fronto-parietal working memory-related network integrity.

Here, we examine in 171 adults (aged  20-94 years) the effects of age on dynamic modulation of blood oxygenation-level  dependent activation to difficulty in parametrically increasing working memory (WM)  load (0-, 2-, 3-, and 4-back conditions). First, we examined parametric increases  and decreases in activation to increasing WM load (positive modulation effect and  negative modulation effect). Second, we examined the effect of age on modulation to  difficulty (WM load) to identify regions that differed with age as difficulty  increased (age-related positive and negative modulation effects). Weakened  modulation to difficulty with age was found in both the positive modulation (middle  frontal, superior/inferior parietal) and negative modulation effect (deactivated)  regions (insula, cingulate, medial superior frontal, fusiform, and parahippocampal  gyri, hippocampus, and lateral occipital cortex). Age-related alterations to  positive modulation emerged later in the lifespan than negative modulation.  Furthermore, these effects were significantly coupled in that greater upmodulation  was associated with lesser downmodulation. Importantly, greater fronto-parietal  upmodulation to difficulty and greater downmodulation of deactivated regions were  associated with better task accuracy and upmodulation with better WM span measured  outside the scanner. These findings suggest that greater dynamic range of modulation  of activation to cognitive challenge is in service of current task performance, as  well as generalizing to cognitive ability beyond the scanner task, lending support  to its utility as a marker of successful cognitive aging.",Dec-17,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,153-163,NA,,60,NA,Neurobiol Aging,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Behavioral findings have suggested that acute aerobic exercise improves children's  working memory; however, there is still very little knowledge about whether a single  session of aerobic exercise can alter working memory's brain activation patterns, as  assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Therefore, we investigated  the effect of acute moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on working memory and its  brain activation patterns in preadolescent children, and further explored the neural  basis of acute aerobic exercise on working memory in these children. We used a  within-subjects design with a counterbalanced order. Nine healthy, right-handed  children were scanned with a Siemens MAGNETOM Trio 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance  imaging scanner while they performed a working memory task (N-back task), following  a baseline session and a 30-min, moderate-intensity exercise session. Compared with  the baseline session, acute moderate-intensity aerobic exercise benefitted  performance in the N-back task, increasing brain activities of bilateral parietal  cortices, left hippocampus, and the bilateral cerebellum. These data extend the  current knowledge by indicating that acute aerobic exercise enhances children's  working memory, and the neural basis may be related to changes in the working  memory's brain activation patterns elicited by acute aerobic exercise.",2016,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,1804,NA,,7,NA,Front Psychol,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 27917141  PMCID: PMC5116552,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/HZD7FWEY/Chen et al. - 2016 - Neural Basis of Working Memory Enhancement after A.pdf,NA,fMRI; working memory; N-back; acute aerobic exercise; brain activation patterns; preadolescent children,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Chen et al. - 2016 - Neural Basis of Working Memory Enhancement after A.pdf

A group of eight subjects took part in  modified versions of the N-back and Sternberg working memory paradigms.  Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data were recorded, and subsequently processed using  beamformer based source imaging methodology. Our study shows statistically  significant increases in θ oscillations during both N-back and Sternberg tasks.  These oscillations were shown to originate in the medial frontal cortex, and further  to scale with memory load. We have also shown that increases in θ oscillations are  accompanied by decreases in β and γ band oscillations at the same spatial  coordinate. These decreases were most prominent in the 20-40 Hz frequency range,  although spectral analysis showed that γ band power decrease extends up to at least  80 Hz. β/γ Power decrease also scales with memory load. Whilst θ increases were  predominately observed in the medial frontal cortex, β/γ decreases were associated  with other brain areas, including nodes of the default mode network (for the N-back  task) and areas associated with language processing (for the Sternberg task). These  observations are in agreement with intracranial EEG and fMRI studies. Finally, we  have shown an intimate relationship between changes in β/γ band oscillatory power at  spatially separate network nodes, implying that activity in these nodes is not  reflective of uni-modal task driven changes in spatially separate brain regions, but  rather represents correlated network activity. The utility of MEG as a non-invasive  means to measure neural oscillatory modulation has been demonstrated and future  studies employing this technology have the potential to gain a better understanding  of neural oscillatory processes, their relationship to functional and effective  connectivity, and their correspondence to BOLD fMRI.",2011-04-15,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,1804-1815,NA,4,55,NA,Neuroimage,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, a comparison of the motion correction tools provided by several leading fMRI  analysis software packages was performed, including AFNI, AIR, BrainVoyager, FSL,  and SPM2. Comparisons were performed using data from typical human studies as well  as phantom data. The identical reconstruction, preprocessing, and analysis steps  were used on every data set, except that motion correction was performed using  various configurations from each software package. Each package was studied using  default parameters, as well as parameters optimized for speed and accuracy. Forty  subjects performed a Go/No-go task (an event-related design that investigates  inhibitory motor response) and an N-back task (a block-design paradigm investigating  working memory). The human data were analyzed by extracting a set of general linear  model (GLM)-derived activation results and comparing the effect of motion correction  on thresholded activation cluster size and maximum t value. In addition, a series of  simulated phantom data sets were created with known activation locations,  magnitudes, and realistic motion. Results from the phantom data indicate that AFNI  and SPM2 yield the most accurate motion estimation parameters, while AFNI's  interpolation algorithm introduces the least smoothing. AFNI is also the fastest of  the packages tested. However, these advantages did not produce noticeably better  activation results in motion-corrected data from typical human fMRI experiments.  Although differences in performance between packages were apparent in the human  data, no single software package produced dramatically better results than the  others. The ""accurate"" parameters showed virtually no improvement in cluster t  values compared to the standard parameters. While the ""fast"" parameters did not  result in a substantial increase in speed, they did not degrade the cluster results  very much either. The phantom and human data indicate that motion correction can be  a valuable step in the data processing chain, yielding improvements of up to 20% in  the magnitude and up to 100% in the cluster size of detected activations, but the  choice of software package does not substantially affect this improvement.",2005-11-15,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,529-543,NA,3,28,NA,Neuroimage,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States PMID: 16099178,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/EZSBP42J/Oakes et al. - 2005 - Comparison of fMRI motion correction software tool.pdf,NA,"Humans; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Oxygen/blood; Brain/*physiology; Memory, Short-Term/physiology; Linear Models; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/*statistics & numerical data; Models, Neurological; Artifacts; *Software; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*statistics & numerical data; Movement",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Oakes et al. - 2005 - Comparison of fMRI motion correction software tool.pdf

The effects of small movements can be ameliorated during data  postprocessing, but data associated with severe movement is frequently discarded. In  discarding these data, it is often assumed that head-movement is a source of random  error, and that data can be discarded from subjects with severe movement without  biasing the sample. We tested this assumption by examining whether head movement was  related to task difficulty and cognitive status among persons with multiple  sclerosis (MS). Thirty-four persons with MS were scanned while performing a working  memory task with three levels of difficulty (the N-back task). Maximum movement  (angle, shift) was estimated for each difficulty level. Cognitive status was  assessed by combining performance on a working memory and processing speed task. An  interaction was found between task difficulty and cognitive status (high vs. low  cognitive ability): there was a linear increase in movement as task difficulty  increased that was larger among subjects with lower cognitive ability. Analyses of  the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) confirmed that increases in movement degraded data  quality. Similar, though far smaller, effects were found in a cohort of healthy  control (HC) subjects. Therefore, discarding data with severe movement artifact may  bias MS samples such that only those with less-severe cognitive impairment are  included in the analyses. However, even if such data are not discarded outright,  subjects who move more (MS and HC) will contribute less to the group-level results  because of degraded SNR.",Jan-14,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,13-Jan,NA,1,35,NA,Hum Brain Mapp,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,"Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 22847906  PMCID: PMC3881195,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/WUNWIBPD/Wylie et al. - 2014 - Functional magnetic resonance imaging movers and s.pdf,NA,"Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; fMRI; Memory, Short-Term; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; multiple sclerosis; *Artifacts; *Movement; Bias; Cognition Disorders/diagnosis/etiology; head movement; Multiple Sclerosis/*complications",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Wylie et al. - 2014 - Functional magnetic resonance imaging movers and s.pdf

METHODS: Thirty-three euthymic bipolar patients with  preserved memory and executive function and 28 euthymic bipolar patients with  significant memory and/or executive impairment, as defined using two test batteries,  the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT) and the Behavioural Assessment of the  Dysexecutive Syndrome (BADS), plus 28 healthy controls underwent structural MRI  using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Twenty-seven of the cognitively preserved  patients, 23 of the cognitively impaired patients and 28 controls also underwent  fMRI during performance of the n-back working memory task. RESULTS: No clusters of  grey or white matter volume difference were found between the two patient groups.  During n-back performance, the cognitively impaired patients showed hypoactivation  compared to the cognitively preserved patients in a circumscribed region in the  right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

The present  study tested whether source estimation of scalp-recorded event-related potentials  (ERPs) can be used to investigate task-dependent AC activations. Subjects were  presented with frequency-varying two-part tones during pitch discrimination, pitch  n-back memory, and visual tasks identical to our previous fMRI study (Rinne et al.,  J Neurosci 29:13338-13343, 2009). ERPs and their minimum-norm source estimates in AC  were strongly modulated by task at 200-700 ms from tone onset. As in the fMRI study,  the pitch discrimination and pitch memory tasks were associated with distinct AC  activation patterns. In the pitch discrimination task, increased activity in the  anterior AC was detected relatively late at 300-700 ms from tone onset. Therefore,  this activity was probably not associated with enhanced pitch processing but rather  with the actual discrimination process (comparison between the two parts of tone).  Increased activity in more posterior areas associated with the pitch memory task, in  turn, occurred at 200-700 ms suggesting that this activity was related to operations  on pitch categories after pitch analysis was completed. Finally, decreased activity  associated with the pitch memory task occurred at 150-300 ms consistent with the  notion that, in the demanding pitch memory task, spectrotemporal analysis is  actively halted as soon as category information has been obtained. These results  demonstrate that ERP source analysis can be used to complement fMRI to investigate  task-dependent activations of human AC.",May-15,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,445-458,NA,3,28,NA,Brain Topogr,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States PMID: 24043402,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/RK8PHVTR/Talja et al. - 2015 - Source analysis of event-related potentials during.pdf,NA,Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Young Adult; Neuropsychological Tests; Photic Stimulation; Memory/*physiology; Electroencephalography; Visual Perception/physiology; Acoustic Stimulation/methods; Evoked Potentials/*physiology; Pitch Perception/*physiology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Talja et al. - 2015 - Source analysis of event-related potentials during.pdf

Thus, we aimed to compare working memory-related functional connectivity  patterns in healthy children and those with ADHD, and study effects of  methylphenidate (MPH). METHOD: Twenty-two boys with ADHD were scanned twice, under  either MPH (single dose, 10 mg) or placebo, in a randomised, cross-over,  counterbalanced placebo-controlled design. Thirty healthy boys were scanned once. We  used fMRI during a numerical n-back task to examine functional connectivity patterns  in case-control and MPH-placebo comparisons, using independent component analysis.  RESULTS: There was no significant difference in behavioural performance between  children with ADHD, treated with MPH or placebo, and healthy controls. Compared with  controls, participants with ADHD under placebo showed increased functional  connectivity within fronto-parietal and auditory networks, and decreased functional  connectivity within the executive control network.

METHODS:  Thirteen right-handed PNE children (M/F = 7:6, average age 11.4 ± 0.8 years) and  15 age-matched, right-handed, healthy controls (M/F = 9:6, 11.3 ± 1.0 years) were  recruited for the study. First, intelligence tests were performed using Chinese  Wechsler Young Children Scales of Intelligence in PNE children and controls. The  full intelligence quotient (FIQ), verbal IQ (VIQ), performance IQ (PIQ) and  memory/caution (M/C) factor were measured. After intelligence tests, event-related  fMRI scans were performed using the categorical N-Back working memory task on a 3.0T  MR scanner.

RESULTS: The FIQ, VIQ and PIQ in the PNE group were within the  normal range and did not significantly differ from the control group (P > 0.05). The  M/C factor was statistically significantly lower in the PNE group (P < 0.05). In the  N-Back test, PNE children had lower PCR and longer mRT than controls (P < 0.05).

Abnormal brain activation during cognitive processing has been reported, both in  task-positive and task-negative networks. Further, structural cortical and  subcortical brain abnormalities have been documented, but little is known about how  task-related brain activation is associated with brain anatomy in SZ compared to  healthy controls (HC). Utilizing linked independent component analysis (LICA), a  data-driven multimodal analysis approach, we investigated structure-function  associations in a large sample of SZ (n = 96) and HC (n = 142). We tested for  associations between task-positive (fronto-parietal) and task-negative  (default-mode) brain networks derived from fMRI activation during an n-back working  memory task, and brain structural measures of surface area, cortical thickness, and  gray matter volume, and to what extent these associations differed in SZ compared to  HC. A significant association (p < .05, corrected for multiple comparisons) was  found between a component reflecting the task-positive fronto-parietal network and  another component reflecting cortical thickness in fronto-temporal brain regions in  SZ, indicating increased activation with increased thickness. Other  structure-function associations across, between and within groups were generally  moderate and significant at a nominal p-level only, with more numerous and stronger  associations in SZ compared to HC. These results indicate a complex pattern of  moderate associations between brain activation during cognitive processing and brain  morphometry, and extend previous findings of fronto-temporal brain abnormalities in  SZ by suggesting a coupling between cortical thickness of these brain regions and  working memory-related brain activation.",2015,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,253-263,NA,,9,NA,Neuroimage Clin,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 26509112  PMCID: PMC4576364,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/63FGZJPR/Brandt et al. - 2015 - Assessing brain structural associations with worki.pdf,NA,"Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Young Adult; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Brain Mapping; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Schizophrenic Psychology; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Reaction Time/physiology; Brain/*pathology; Schizophrenia; Models, Neurological; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Default-mode; Fronto-parietal; Linked independent component analysis; Neural Pathways/blood supply/*pathology; Principal Component Analysis; Schizophrenia/*pathology/*physiopathology; Structure–function",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Brandt et al. - 2015 - Assessing brain structural associations with worki.pdf

Distinctive functional connectivity patterns were also found in the ADHD in these  regions, with a tighter coupling in the updating than in the control condition with  a distributed WM-related cerebral network. Especially, cerebellum showed tighter  coupling with activity in an area compatible with the brainstem red nucleus.

Both participants  underwent a course of auditory WM training and completed baseline and post-training  assessments such as self-perceived stress, performance satisfaction questionnaires,  behavioral task performance, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. They were  trained on a computerized auditory WM task (n-back) 5 days a week for 6 weeks, for a  total of 20 h. Participant 1 had high levels of perceived stress, both pre- and  post-training, and showed improvement on the satisfaction aspect of functional  engagement only. Participant 2 had lower levels of perceived stress and demonstrated  improvements on all performance tasks. Neuroimaging results showed evidence of  improved neural efficiency on the trained task for participant 2. The results shed  light on the need to evaluate psychological influences, e.g., stress, when studying  the neuroplastic changes in people with stroke.

As yet, however, the mechanisms by which interference  operates remain elusive. A better knowledge of these processes may facilitate our  understanding of the effects of attention on human performance and the debilitating  consequences that disruptions to attention can have. According to the load theory of  cognitive control, processing of task-irrelevant stimuli is increased by attending  in parallel to a relevant task with high cognitive demands. This is due to the  relevant task engaging cognitive control resources that are, hence, unavailable to  inhibit the processing of task-irrelevant stimuli. However, it has also been  demonstrated that a variety of types of load (perceptual and emotional) can result  in a reduction of the processing of task-irrelevant stimuli, suggesting a uniform  effect of increased load irrespective of the type of load. In the present study, we  concurrently presented a relevant auditory matching task [n-back working memory  (WM)] of low or high cognitive load (1-back or 2-back WM) and task-irrelevant images  at one of three object visibility levels (0%, 50%, or 100%). fMRI activation during  the processing of the task-irrelevant visual stimuli was measured in the lateral  occipital cortex and found to be reduced under high, compared to low, WM load. In  combination with previous findings, this result is suggestive of a more generalized  load theory, whereby cognitive load, as well as other types of load (e.g.,  perceptual), can result in a reduction of the processing of task-irrelevant stimuli,  in line with a uniform effect of increased load irrespective of the type of load.",Mar-10,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,437-446,NA,3,22,NA,J Cogn Neurosci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States PMID: 19302005,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/VZTEUTJM/Klemen et al. - 2010 - Auditory working memory load impairs visual ventra.pdf,NA,"Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Young Adult; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Visual Perception/*physiology; Cognition; Attention/physiology; Auditory Perception/*physiology; Occipital Lobe/physiology; Inhibition, Psychological; Visual Pathways/*physiology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Klemen et al. - 2010 - Auditory working memory load impairs visual ventra.pdf

METHODS: A regional cohort of 28 EPT/ELBW children and 28  term-born controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning  at 11 y of age while performing a combined Stroop n-back task. Group differences in  BOLD activation were analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 analysis  software package, and reaction times (RTs) and response accuracy (RA) were compared  in a multifactorial ANOVA test. RESULTS: The BOLD activation pattern in the preterm  group involved the same areas (cingulate, prefrontal, and parietal cortexes), but  all areas displayed significantly less activation than those in the control group,  particularly when the cognitive load was increased. The RA results corresponded with  the activation data in that the preterm group had significantly fewer correct  responses. No group difference was found regarding RTs.

It invariably initiates latent infection in sensory ganglia enabling  persistent, lifelong infection. Acute HSV-1 encephalitis is rare and definitive  evidence of latent infection in the brain is lacking. However, exposure untraceable  to encephalitis has been repeatedly associated with impaired working memory and  executive functions, particularly among schizophrenia patients. METHODS: Patterns of  HSV-1 infection and gene expression changes were examined in human induced  pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. Separately, differences in blood  oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses to working memory challenges using  letter n-back tests were investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging  (fMRI) among schizophrenia cases/controls. RESULTS: HSV-1 induced lytic changes in  iPSC-derived glutamatergic neurons and neuroprogenitor cells. In neurons, HSV-1 also  entered a quiescent state following coincubation with antiviral drugs, with  distinctive changes in gene expression related to functions such as glutamatergic  signaling. In the fMRI studies, main effects of schizophrenia (P = .001) and HSV-1  exposure (1-back, P = 1.76 × 10(-4); 2-back, P = 1.39 × 10(-5)) on BOLD responses  were observed. We also noted increased BOLD responses in the frontoparietal,  thalamus, and midbrain regions among HSV-1 exposed schizophrenia cases and controls,  compared with unexposed persons. CONCLUSIONS: The lytic/quiescent cycles in  iPSC-derived neurons indicate that persistent neuronal infection can occur, altering  cellular function. The fMRI studies affirm the associations between nonencephalitic  HSV-1 infection and functional brain changes linked with working memory impairment.  The fMRI and iPSC studies together provide putative mechanisms for the cognitive  impairments linked to HSV-1 exposure.",Jan-15,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,123-132,NA,1,41,NA,Schizophr Bull,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,© The Author 2014.

For example, it is unclear whether  intrinsic activity can also predict task-evoked deactivation and whether the  rest-task relationship is dependent on task load. In this study, we addressed these  issues on 40 healthy control subjects using resting-state and task-driven [N-back  working memory (WM) task] functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected in  the same session. Using amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) as an index of  intrinsic resting-state activity, we found that ALFF in the middle frontal gyrus and  inferior/superior parietal lobules was positively correlated with WM task-evoked  activation, while ALFF in the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex,  superior frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and fusiform gyrus was negatively  correlated with WM task-evoked deactivation. Further, the relationship between the  intrinsic resting-state activity and task-evoked activation in lateral/superior  frontal gyri, inferior/superior parietal lobules, superior temporal gyrus, and  midline regions was stronger at higher WM task loads. In addition, both  resting-state activity and the task-evoked activation in the superior parietal  lobule/precuneus were significantly correlated with the WM task behavioral  performance, explaining similar portions of intersubject performance variance.  Together, these findings suggest that intrinsic resting-state activity facilitates  or is permissive of specific brain circuit engagement to perform a cognitive task,  and that resting activity can predict subsequent task-evoked brain responses and  behavioral performance.",Dec-13,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,3204-3215,NA,12,34,NA,Hum Brain Mapp,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,"Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 22711376  PMCID: PMC6870161,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/3QV9AUNW/Zou et al. - 2013 - Intrinsic resting-state activity predicts working .pdf,NA,"Humans; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Young Adult; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Oxygen/blood; Functional Laterality; Brain/blood supply/*physiology; Predictive Value of Tests; Rest/*physiology; N-back working memory; ALFF; behavior; Behavior/*physiology; load dependency; resting-state fMRI",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Zou et al. - 2013 - Intrinsic resting-state activity predicts working .pdf

A functional intronic  SNP (rs1076560) predicts relative expression of the two D2 receptors isoforms, D2S  (mainly pre-synaptic) and D2L (mainly post-synaptic). However, the effect of  functional genetic variation of DRD2 on striatal dopamine D2 signaling and on its  correlation with prefrontal activity during working memory in humans is not known.  METHODS: Thirty-seven healthy subjects were genotyped for rs1076560 (G>T) and  underwent SPECT with [123I]IBZM (which binds primarily to post-synaptic D2  receptors) and with [123I]FP-CIT (which binds to pre-synaptic dopamine transporters,  whose activity and density is also regulated by pre-synaptic D2 receptors), as well  as BOLD fMRI during N-Back working memory. RESULTS: Subjects carrying the T allele  (previously associated with reduced D2S expression) had striatal reductions of  [123I]IBZM and of [123I]FP-CIT binding. DRD2 genotype also differentially predicted  the correlation between striatal dopamine D2 signaling (as identified with factor  analysis of the two radiotracers) and activity of the prefrontal cortex during  working memory as measured with BOLD fMRI, which was positive in GG subjects and  negative in GT. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that this functional SNP within  DRD2 predicts striatal binding of the two radiotracers to dopamine transporters and  D2 receptors as well as the correlation between striatal D2 signaling with  prefrontal cortex activity during performance of a working memory task. These data  are consistent with the possibility that the balance of excitatory/inhibitory  modulation of striatal neurons may also affect striatal outputs in relationship with  prefrontal activity during working memory performance within the  cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical pathway.",2010-02-22,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,e9348,NA,2,5,NA,PLoS One,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 20179754  PMCID: PMC2825256,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/4948A33E/Bertolino et al. - 2010 - Genetically determined measures of striatal D2 sig.pdf,NA,"Humans; Female; Male; Genotype; Adult; Young Adult; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Psychomotor Performance/physiology; Analysis of Variance; Prefrontal Cortex/anatomy & histology/*physiology; Benzamides/metabolism; Binding, Competitive; Corpus Striatum/*metabolism; Dopamine Antagonists/metabolism; Introns/genetics; Pyrrolidines/metabolism; Radioligand Assay; Receptors, Dopamine D2/*genetics/metabolism",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Bertolino et al. - 2010 - Genetically determined measures of striatal D2 sig.pdf

An understanding of the neural substrates  of such impairments may help to understand how nicotine affects cognition. Our aim,  therefore, was to identify abnormalities in the circuitry that mediates working  memory in nicotine-dependent subjects after they initiate abstinence from smoking.  METHODS: We used blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI) to study eight smokers while they performed a letter version of the  N-Back working memory task under satiety (< or = 1.5 hours abstinence) and  abstinence (> or = 14 hours abstinence) conditions. RESULTS: Task-related activity  in the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) showed a significant  interaction between test session (satiety, abstinence) and task load (1-back,  2-back, and 3-back). This interaction reflected the fact that task-related activity  in the satiety condition was relatively low during performance of the 1-back task  but greater at the more difficult task levels, whereas task-related activity in the  abstinence condition was relatively high at the 1-back level and did not increase at  the more difficult task levels.

The delayed matching-to-sample (dMTS) task is  another WM task, which in turn involves the encoding, maintenance, and retrieval of  stimulus representations in sequential order. Because both n-back and dMTS engage WM  function, we hypothesized that compared to a control task not taxing WM, training on  the n-back task would be associated with better performance on dMTS by virtue of  training a shared mental capacity. We tested this hypothesis by randomly assigning  subjects (N = 43) to train on either the n-back (including 2-back and 3-back levels)  or an active control task. Following training, dMTS was administered in the fMRI  scanner. The n-back group performed marginally better than the active control group  on dMTS. In addition, although the n-back group improved more on the less difficult  2-back level than the more difficult 3-back level across training sessions, it was  improvement on the 3-back level that accounted for 21% of the variance in dMTS  performance. For the control group, improvement in training across sessions was  unrelated to dMTS performance. At the neural level, greater activation in the left  inferior frontal gyrus, right posterior parietal cortex, and the cerebellum  distinguished the n-back group from the control group in the maintenance phase of  dMTS. Degree of improvement on the 3-back level across training sessions was  correlated with activation in right lateral prefrontal and motor cortices in the  maintenance phase of dMTS. Our results suggest that although n-back training is more  likely to improve performance in easier blocks, it is improvement in more difficult  blocks that is predictive of performance on a target task drawing on WM. In  addition, the extent to which training on a task can transfer to another task is  likely due to the engagement of shared cognitive capacities and underlying neural  substrates-in this case WM.",2015,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,86,NA,,9,NA,Front Syst Neurosci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 26082694  PMCID: PMC4451342,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/4HPUSI8J/Beatty et al. - 2015 - Transfer of training from one working memory task .pdf,NA,working memory; n-back; prefrontal cortex; cognitive training; delayed matching-to-sample,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Beatty et al. - 2015 - Transfer of training from one working memory task .pdf

MATERIALS AND METHODS: At hospital discharge and 3  months later, fMRI assessed subjects' functional activity during an N-back task.  Multiple linear regression was used to examine associations between duration of  delirium and brain activity, and elastic net regression was used to assess the  relationship between brain activation patterns at 3 months and cognitive outcomes at  12 months. RESULTS: Of 47 patients who underwent fMRI at discharge, 38 (80%)  completed the protocol; of 37 who underwent fMRI at 3 months, 34 (91%) completed the  protocol. At discharge, the mean (SD) percentage of correct responses on the most  challenging version (the N2 version) of the N-back task was 70.4 (23.2; range of  20-100) compared with 76 (23.4; range of 33-100) at 3 months.

OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that lowering the  typical dietary PA/OA would affect the activation of relevant brain networks during  a working memory task and would also lower secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines.  DESIGN: In 12 female subjects participating in a randomized, cross-over trial  comparing 3-week high PA diet (HPA) and low PA and a high OA diet (HOA), we  evaluated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using an N-back test of  working memory, cytokine secretion by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated peripheral  blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and plasma cytokine concentrations. RESULTS: Brain  activation during the HPA diet compared to the HOA diet was increased in regions of  the basal ganglia including the caudate and putamen (p<0.005). In addition, compared  to the HOA diet, during the HPA diet, the plasma concentrations of IL-6 (p=0.04) and  IL-1β (p=0.05) were higher, and there was a higher secretion of IL-18 (p=0.015) and  a trend for higher IL-1β secretion (p=0.066) from LPS-stimulated PBMCs. CONCLUSIONS:  The HPA diet resulted in increased brain activation in the basal ganglia compared to  the HOA diet as well as increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These  data provide evidence that short-term (2week) diet interventions impact brain  network activation during a working memory task and that these effects are  reversible since the order of the study diets was randomized.

In a group of patients who performed relatively  well on this task, there were three fundamental deviations from the 'healthy'  pattern of PFC fMRI activation to varying WM difficulty. The first characteristic  was a greater magnitude of PFC fMRI activation in the context of slightly impaired  WM performance (i.e. physiological inefficiency). The second was that the  significant correlations between behavioral WM performance and dorsal PFC fMRI  activation were in opposite directions in the two groups. Third, the magnitude of  the abnormal dorsal PFC fMRI response was predicted by an assay of N-acetylaspartate  concentrations (NAA) in dorsal PFC, a measure of neuronal pathology obtained using  proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

The modified Story Memory Technique (mSMT) has been shown to improve new learning and  memory in MS, but its effects on working memory (WM) are currently unknown.  OBJECTIVE: The present study presents a secondary analysis of data from a larger  double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial and examines changes in  cerebral activation on a WM task following mSMT treatment. METHODS: Sixteen  participants with clinically definite MS were randomly assigned to treatment (n=7)  or placebo-control groups (n=9) matched for gender, age and education. Baseline and  immediate follow-up functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was obtained for  all subjects. During fMRI participants completed an N-back task, consisting of 0-,  1-and 2-back conditions. RESULTS: Significant increases in cerebral activation were  noted in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area and inferior  parietal lobule at follow-up in the treatment group. No significant changes were  noted in the placebo control group. CONCLUSION: Due to the small sample size,  results of the current study should be interpreted as preliminary. However, the  observed pattern of activation of the frontoparietal network involved in WM found in  the treatment group, suggests that mSMT training increases recruitment of attention-  and WM-related neural networks.

Serotonin agonists modulate WM and there is evidence of  positive behavioural effects in both disorders. We therefore used functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate shared and disorder-specific brain  dysfunctions of WM in these disorders, and the effects of a single dose of the  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine. METHOD: Age-matched boys  with ADHD (n = 17), ASD (n = 17) and controls (n = 22) were compared using fMRI  during an N-back WM task. Patients were scanned twice, under either an acute dose of  fluoxetine or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized design.  Repeated-measures analyses within patients assessed drug effects on performance and  brain function. To test for normalization effects of brain dysfunctions, patients  under each drug condition were compared to controls. RESULTS: Under placebo,  relative to controls, both ADHD and ASD boys shared underactivation in the right  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Fluoxetine significantly normalized the  DLPFC underactivation in ASD relative to controls whereas it increased posterior  cingulate cortex (PCC) deactivation in ADHD relative to control boys. Within-patient  analyses showed inverse effects of fluoxetine on PCC deactivation, which it enhanced  in ADHD and decreased in ASD.

Studies in humanized mice document an interaction between estrus cycle-related  changes in estradiol secretion and BDNF Val(66)Met genotype on measures of  hippocampal function and anxiety-like behavior. We believe our multimodal imaging  data provide the first demonstration in women that the effects of the BDNF Val/Met  polymorphism on hippocampal function are selectively modulated by estradiol. In a  6-month pharmacological hormone manipulation protocol, healthy, regularly  menstruating, asymptomatic women completed positron emission tomography (PET) and  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans while performing the n-back  working memory task during three hormone conditions: ovarian suppression induced by  the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, leuprolide acetate; leuprolide plus  estradiol; and leuprolide plus progesterone. For each of the three hormone  conditions, a discovery data set was obtained with oxygen-15 water regional cerebral  blood flow PET in 39 healthy women genotyped for BDNF Val(66)Met, and a confirmatory  data set was obtained with fMRI in 27 women.

A number of studies support the  assumptions of GWT by showing the reorganization of the whole-brain functional  network during cognitive task performance; however, the involvement of specific  large scale networks in the formation of workspace is still not well-understood. The  aims of our study were: (1) to examine changes in the whole-brain functional network  under increased cognitive demands of working memory during an n-back task, and their  relationship with behavioral outcomes; and (2) to provide a comprehensive  description of local changes that may be involved in the formation of the global  workspace, using hub detection and network-based statistic. Our results show that  network modularity decreased with increasing cognitive demands, and this change  allowed us to predict behavioral performance. The number of connector hubs  increased, whereas the number of provincial hubs decreased when the task became more  demanding. We also found that the default mode network (DMN) increased its  connectivity to other networks while decreasing connectivity between its own  regions. These results, apart from replicating previous findings, provide a valuable  insight into the mechanisms of the formation of the global workspace, highlighting  the role of the DMN in the processes of network integration.

Evidence exists that aging is accompanied by a reorganization of the working-memory circuitry, but the underlying  neurocognitive mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we examined aging-related  changes in prefrontal activation during working-memory performance using functional  Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), a noninvasive neuroimaging technique. Seventeen  healthy young (21-32 years) and 17 healthy older adults (64-81 years) performed a  verbal working-memory task (n-back). Oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin  concentration changes were registered by two fNIRS channels located over the left  and right prefrontal cortex. Increased working-memory load resulted in worse  performance compared to the control condition in older adults, but not in young  participants. In both young and older adults, prefrontal activation increased with  rising working-memory load. Young adults showed slight right-hemispheric dominance  at low levels of working-memory load, while no hemispheric differences were apparent  in older adults. Analysis of the time-activation curve during the high  working-memory load condition revealed a continuous increase of the hemodynamic  response in the young. In contrast to that, a quadratic pattern of activation was  found in the older participants. Based on these results it could be hypothesized  that young adults were better able to keep the prefrontal cortex recruited over a  prolonged period of time. To conclude, already at low levels of working-memory load  do older adults recruit both hemispheres, possibly in an attempt to compensate for  the observed aging-related decline in performance. Also, our study shows that aging  effects on the time course of the hemodynamic response must be taken into account in  the interpretation of the results of neuroimaging studies that rely on blood oxygen  levels, such as fMRI.",2012,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,e46210,NA,9,7,NA,PLoS One,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 23029437  PMCID: PMC3460859,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/4NCU75NF/Vermeij et al. - 2012 - Effects of aging on cerebral oxygenation during wo.pdf,NA,"Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Middle Aged; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Reaction Time; Aging/*physiology; Prefrontal Cortex/blood supply/*physiology; Hemodynamics/*physiology; Oxygen/*physiology; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Vermeij et al. - 2012 - Effects of aging on cerebral oxygenation during wo.pdf

H(3) receptors are expressed in neocortical  areas, including the prefrontal cortex, the key region of cognitive functions such  as working memory. However, the role of prefrontal H(3) receptors in working memory  has not yet been clarified. Therefore, using functional magnetic resonance imaging  (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) techniques, we aimed to investigate  the association between the neural activity of working memory and the density of  H(3) receptors in the prefrontal cortex. FINDINGS: Ten healthy volunteers underwent  both fMRI and PET scans. The N-back task was used to assess the neural activities  related to working memory. H(3) receptor density was measured with the selective PET  radioligand [(11)C] TASP457. The neural activity of the right dorsolateral  prefrontal cortex during the performance of the N-back task was negatively  correlated with the density of H(3) receptors in this region. CONCLUSIONS: Higher  neural activity of working memory was associated with lower H(3) receptor density in  the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

Heritable prefrontal fMRI  activation during working memory (WM) is such a phenotype. We hypothesized that  urban upbringing (childhood urbanicity) would alter this phenotype and interact with  dopamine genes that regulate prefrontal function during WM. Further, dopamine has  been hypothesized to mediate urban-associated factors like social stress. WM-related  prefrontal function was tested for main effects of urbanicity, main effects of three  dopamine genes-catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1), and  dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2)-and, importantly, dopamine gene-by-urbanicity  interactions. For COMT, three independent human samples were recruited (total n =  487). We also studied 253 subjects genotyped for DRD1 and DRD2. 3T fMRI activation  during the N-back WM task was the dependent variable, while childhood urbanicity,  dopamine genotype, and urbanicity-dopamine interactions were independent variables.  Main effects of dopamine genes and of urbanicity were found. Individuals raised in  an urban environment showed altered prefrontal activation relative to those raised  in rural or town settings. For each gene, dopamine genotype-by-urbanicity  interactions were shown in prefrontal cortex-COMT replicated twice in two  independent samples. An urban childhood upbringing altered prefrontal function and  interacted with each gene to alter genotype-phenotype relationships.

A large  subgroup seems to experience OCS as a consequence of second-generation antipsychotic  agents (SGA), such as clozapine. So far little is known about underlying neural  mechanisms. METHODS: To investigate the role of SGA treatment on neural processing  related to OCS in patients with schizophrenia, we stratified patients according to  their monotherapy into 2 groups (group I: clozapine or olanzapine; group II:  amisulpride or aripiprazole). We used an fMRI approach, applying a go/no-go task  assessing inhibitory control and an n-back task measuring working memory. RESULTS:  We enrolled 21 patients in group I and 19 patients in group II. Groups did not  differ regarding age, sex, education or severity of psychotic symptoms. Frequency  and severity of OCS were significantly higher in group I and were associated with  pronounced deficits in specific cognitive abilities. Whereas brain activation  patterns did not differ during working memory, group I showed significantly  increased activation in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) during response inhibition.  Alterations in OFC activation were associated with the severity of obsessions and  mediated the association between SGA treatment and co-occurring OCS on a trend  level. LIMITATIONS: The main limitation of this study is its cross-sectional design.  CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first imaging study conducted to elucidate  SGA effects on neural systems related to OCS. We propose that alterations in brain  functioning reflect a pathogenic mechanism in the development of SGA-induced OCS in  patients with schizophrenia.

HCs are usually administered in a monthly cycle with both  synthetic-hormone-containing and synthetic-hormone-absent phases. The synthetic  hormones contained in HCs affect a wide range of neurophysiological systems,  suggesting that effects of the medication might only be observed during the  synthetic-hormone-containing phase of the HC cycle. To test this, women were seen  twice, once during the hormone-present phase and once during the hormone-absent  phase of the HC cycle. In each session, women performed an n-back working memory  task to assess pre-stress performance outside of the magnetic resonance imaging  scanner, were then exposed to cold pressor stress, and again completed the n-back  task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The free cortisol response to  stress remained the same across the HC cycle. Women also performed comparably on the  n-back task after stress exposure across the two phases. However, despite these  similarities, women displayed greater disengagement of default mode network as task  demands increased during the hormone-present phase only, a pattern more in line with  working memory-related brain activation under non-stressful conditions reported in  other studies. The results suggest that the synthetic hormones contained in HCs may  mitigate stress-related disruptions of typical brain activation patterns during the  hormone-present phase of the HC cycle, despite exhibiting comparable cortisol  responses across the HC cycle.

This study examined neuropsychological, behavioral, and  brain functioning in adolescents post-mTBI to assess whether persistent differences  were detectable up to a year post-injury. METHODS: Nineteen adolescents on average  7.5 months post-mTBI completed neuropsychological testing and an fMRI  auditory-verbal N-back working memory task. Parents completed behavioral ratings.  The comparison group included 19 healthy controls matched to the mTBI group for  demographic variables and N-back task performance. RESULTS: There were no  between-group differences for cognition or behavior ratings. The expected decreased  accuracy and increased reaction time as N-back task difficulty increased were  apparent. The mTBI group showed significantly greater brain activation than controls  during the most difficult working memory load condition. CONCLUSION: Greater working  memory task-related activation was found in adolescents up to one year post-mTBI  relative to controls, potentially indicating compensatory activation to support  normal task performance.

Brain imaging studies on visuospatial WM in alcohol-dependent  patients compared to controls indicate that information processing requires  compensatory increased neural activation to perform at a normal level. However, to  date, no study tested whether such increased neural WM activation patterns or the  lack thereof predict relapse behavior in alcohol-dependent individuals, and whether  such differences persist when adequately correcting for individual grey matter  differences. We combined analyses of neural activation during an n-back task and  local grey matter volumes using Biological Parametric Mapping in 40 detoxified  alcohol-dependent patients and 40 matched healthy controls (HC), and assessed  prospective relapse risk during a 7-month follow-up period. Despite equal task  performance, we found increased functional activation during high versus low  cognitive WM load (2-back-0-back) in bilateral rostral prefrontal cortex (BA10) and  bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (BA45,47) in prospective abstainers versus  relapsers, and further in left/right lateral/medial premotor cortex (BA6,8) in  abstainers versus HC. In prospective abstainers, but not relapsers, subtle cognitive  impairment was associated with increased neural task activity in the premotor  cortex.

To examine a particular clinical concern regarding the possible  impact of ADT on cognition, the current study combined neuropsychological testing  with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess both brain activation  during cognitive performance as well as the integrity of brain connectivity.  METHODS: In a prospective observational cohort analysis of men with non-metastatic  prostate cancer at a Veterans Affairs medical center, patients receiving ADT were  compared with patients not receiving ADT at baseline and at 6 months. Assessments  included fMRI, the N-back task (for working memory), the stop-signal task (for  cognitive control), and a quality of life questionnaire. RESULTS: Among 36 patients  enrolled (18 in each group), 30 completed study evaluations (15 in each group); 5  withdrew participation and 1 died. Results for the N-back task, stop-signal task,  and quality of life were similar at 6 months vs. baseline in each group. In  contrast, statistically significant associations were found between ADT use (vs. non  use) and decreased medial prefrontal cortical activation during cognitive control,  as well as decreased connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex and other  regions involved with cognitive control.

This study examines neurofunctional differences  during working memory between breast cancer (BC) patients and controls, prior to  chemotherapy. METHODS: Early stage BC females (23), scanned after surgery but before  chemotherapy, were individually matched to non-cancer controls. Participants  underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a  Visuospatial N-back task and data was analyzed by multiple group comparisons. fMRI  task performance, neuropsychological tests, hospital records, and salivary  biomarkers were also collected. RESULTS: There were no significant group differences  on neuropsychological tests, estrogen, or cortisol. Patients made significantly  fewer commission errors but had less overall correct responses and were slower than  controls during the task. Significant group differences were observed for the fMRI  data, yet results depended on the type of analysis. BC patients presented with  increased activations during working memory compared to controls in areas such as  the inferior frontal gyrus, insula, thalamus, and midbrain. Individual group  regressions revealed a reverse relationship between brain activity and commission  errors. CONCLUSION: This is the first fMRI investigation to reveal  neurophysiological differences during visuospatial working memory between BC  patients pre-chemotherapy and controls.

Very little is known regarding BH4 treatment and its  effect on brain and cognition. The present study represents the first examination of  potential changes in neural activation in patients with PKU during BH4 treatment. To  this end, we utilized an n-back working memory task in conjunction with functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate functional brain integrity in a sample  of individuals with PKU at three timepoints: Just prior to BH4 treatment, after  4 weeks of treatment, and after 6 months of treatment. Neural activation patterns  observed for the PKU treatment group were compared with those of a  demographically-matched sample of healthy non-PKU individuals who were assessed at  identical time intervals. Consistent with past research, baseline evaluation  revealed impaired working memory and atypical brain activation in the PKU group as  compared to the non-PKU group.

Only few take advantage of the intrinsic characteristics  of SPECT, particularly those allowing cognitive assessment outside of the camera, in  settings close to the standard clinical or laboratory ones. The purpose of the study  was to assess the feasibility of a split-dose activation protocol with (99m)Tc-HMPAO  using low irradiation dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A two-scans protocol was applied  to 12 healthy young volunteers using 270 MBq of (99m)Tc-HMPAO per scan, with each  image associated to a particular experimental condition of the verbal n-back working  memory task (0-back, 2-back). Subtraction method was used to identify regional brain  activity related to the task. RESULTS: Voxel-wise statistical analysis showed left  lateralized activity associated with the 2-back task, compared to the 0-back task.  Activated regions, mainly prefrontal and parietal, were similar to those observed in  previous fMRI and (15)O-PET studies. CONCLUSION: The results support the use of  (99m)Tc-HMPAO SPECT for the investigation of brain-cognition relations and  demonstrate the feasibility of optimal quality images despite low  radiopharmaceutical doses. The findings also acknowledge the use of HMPAO as a  radioligand to capture neuro-energetic modulations linked to cognitive activity.  They encourage extending the application of the described activation protocol to  clinical populations.",Apr-08,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,695-703,NA,4,35,NA,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 18231790  PMCID: PMC2755766,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/FRKMFELV/Ludwig et al. - 2008 - Functional imaging studies of cognition using 99mT.pdf,NA,"Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Reference Values; Brain/*diagnostic imaging; Brain Mapping/*methods; *Cognition; Reproducibility of Results; Reading; Computers; *Technetium Tc 99m Exametazime/standards; Quality Assurance, Health Care; Radiopharmaceuticals/standards/*therapeutic use; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon/*methods/standards",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Ludwig et al. - 2008 - Functional imaging studies of cognition using 99mT.pdf

In the present study, we aimed to assess how recent smoking  (overnight abstinence vs. smoking ad libitum) influenced the effect of smoking a  cigarette on brain activity related to a working memory challenge. Six smokers  performed the N-Back working memory task during functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI) both before and after smoking a cigarette in each of two test  sessions: one following overnight abstinence from smoking ( approximately 13 h) and  the other following ad libitum smoking. Task-related activity in L-DLPFC showed a  significant interaction between the effects of acute smoking, test session, and task  load. After overnight abstinence, post-smoking brain activity in L-DLPFC was lower  than before smoking at low task load and higher at high task load; corresponding  activity on a day of ad libitum smoking was higher at low load and lower at high  task load after smoking during the session. These data suggest that the effect of  acute smoking on working memory processing depends on recent prior smoking and task  load. In particular, they provide preliminary evidence that functional efficiency of  working memory is improved by smoking a cigarette during abstinence, while the  effect of a cigarette in a non-deprived state varies with the nature and difficulty  of the working memory challenge. This interaction merits further examination in  larger studies specifically designed to consider this issue.",2006-12-01,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,103-109,NA,03-Feb,148,NA,Psychiatry Res,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 17088048  PMCID: PMC1817900,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/NTXMK7E3/Xu et al. - 2006 - Effects of acute smoking on brain activity vary wi.pdf,NA,"Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Attention/drug effects/physiology; Brain/*drug effects/physiopathology; Dominance, Cerebral/physiology; Prefrontal Cortex/*drug effects/physiopathology; Psychomotor Performance/drug effects/physiology; *Smoking Cessation/psychology; Arousal/drug effects/physiology; Nicotine/*adverse effects; Pattern Recognition, Visual/*drug effects/physiology; Smoking/adverse effects/*physiopathology; Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/*physiopathology; Tobacco Use Disorder/*physiopathology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Xu et al. - 2006 - Effects of acute smoking on brain activity vary wi.pdf

However, several studies have shown that WM training may lead to performance increases not only in the trained  task, but also in untrained cognitive transfer tasks. It has been suggested that  transfer effects occur if training task and transfer task share specific processing  components that are supposedly processed in the same brain areas. In the current  study, we investigated whether single-task WM training and training-related  alterations in neural activity might support performance in a dual-task setting,  thus assessing transfer effects to higher-order control processes in the context of  dual-task coordination. A sample of older adults (age 60-72) was assigned to either  a training or control group. The training group participated in 12 sessions of an  adaptive n-back training. At pre and post-measurement, a multimodal dual-task was  performed in all participants to assess transfer effects. This task consisted of two  simultaneous delayed match to sample WM tasks using two different stimulus  modalities (visual and auditory) that were performed either in isolation  (single-task) or in conjunction (dual-task). A subgroup also participated in  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the performance of the n-back  task before and after training. While no transfer to single-task performance was  found, dual-task costs in both the visual modality (p < 0.05) and the auditory  modality (p < 0.05) decreased at post-measurement in the training but not in the  control group. In the fMRI subgroup of the training participants, neural activity  changes in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during one-back predicted  post-training auditory dual-task costs, while neural activity changes in right DLPFC  during three-back predicted visual dual-task costs. Results might indicate an  improvement in central executive processing that could facilitate both WM and  dual-task coordination.",2017,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,85,NA,,11,NA,Front Hum Neurosci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 28286477  PMCID: PMC5323430,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/LXQF7ITE/Heinzel et al. - 2017 - Transfer Effects to a Multimodal Dual-Task after W.pdf,NA,fMRI; working memory; aging; cognitive training; neuroimaging; dual-task; modality; transfer,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Heinzel et al. - 2017 - Transfer Effects to a Multimodal Dual-Task after W.pdf

Recently, BOLD fMRI work has largely shifted to focus on WM and resting  functional connectivity following TBI. However, fundamental questions in WM remain.  Specifically, the effects of injury on the basic relationships between local and  interregional functional neuroimaging signals during WM processing early following  moderate to severe TBI have not been examined. This study employs a mixed effects  model to examine prefrontal cortex and parietal lobe signal change during a WM task,  the n-back, and whether there is covariance between regions of high amplitude signal  change, (synchrony of elicited activity (SEA) very early following TBI. We also  examined whether signal change and SEA differentially predict performance during WM.  Overall, percent signal change in the right prefrontal cortex (rPFC) was and  important predictor of both reaction time (RT) and SEA in early TBI and matched  controls. Right prefrontal cortex (rPFC) percent signal change positively predicted  SEA within and between persons regardless of injury status, suggesting that the link  between these neurodynamic processes in WM-activated regions remains unaffected even  very early after TBI. Additionally, rPFC activity was positively related to RT  within and between persons in both groups. Right parietal (rPAR) activity was  negatively related to RT within subjects in both groups. Thus, the local signal  intensity of the rPFC in TBI appears to be a critical property of network  functioning and performance in WM processing and may be a precursor to recruitment  observed in chronic samples. The present results suggest that as much research moves  toward large scale functional connectivity modeling, it will be essential to develop  integrated models of how local and distant neurodynamics promote WM performance  after TBI.",Jun-15,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,285-301,NA,2,9,NA,Brain Imaging Behav,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States PMID: 24906546,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/BGJI93FS/Medaglia et al. - 2015 - Modeling distinct imaging hemodynamics early after.pdf,NA,"Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Neuropsychological Tests; Reaction Time; Brain Mapping/methods; Brain Injuries/*physiopathology; *Models, Neurological; Brain/blood supply/*physiopathology; Hemodynamics/*physiology; Cerebrovascular Circulation/*physiology; Neural Pathways/blood supply/physiopathology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Medaglia et al. - 2015 - Modeling distinct imaging hemodynamics early after.pdf

The literature suggests that cognitive functions, such as problem  solving or perception, differ between supine and upright postures. However, the  effect of posture on many cognitive functions is still unknown. Therefore, the aim  of the present study was to investigate the effects of body posture (supine vs.  sitting) on one of the most frequently used paradigms in the cognitive sciences: the  N-back working memory paradigm. Twenty-two subjects were investigated in a  randomized within-subject design. Subjects performed the N-back task on two  consecutive days in either the supine or the upright posture. Subjective sleep  quality and chronic stress were recorded as covariates. Furthermore, changes in mood  dimensions and heart rate variability (HRV) were assessed during the experiment.  Results indicate that the quality of sleep strongly affects reaction times when  subjects performed a working memory task in a supine posture. These effects,  however, could not be observed in the sitting position. The findings can be  explained by HRV parameters that indicated differences in autonomic regulation in  the upright vs. the supine posture.

Twenty-five young healthy participants  performed an N-back task with fearful and neutral faces as stimuli. Participants  made more errors when performing 0-back task with fearful versus neutral faces,  whereas they made fewer errors when performing 2-back task with fearful versus  neutral faces. These emotional impairment and enhancement on behavioral performance  paralleled significant interactions in distributed regions in the salience network  including anterior insula (AI) and dorsal cingulate cortex (dACC), as well as in  emotion perception network including amygdala and temporal-occipital association  cortex (TOC).

METHODS: Ten patients with  childhood-onset SLE underwent formal neuropsychological testing and FMRI using 3  paradigms: a continuous performance task (CPT) to evaluate attention, an N-Back task  to assess working memory, and verb generation to evaluate language processing.  Composite Z maps were generated to summarize the brain activation patterns for each  FMRI paradigm in patients with childhood-onset SLE and to compare these patterns  with those observed in healthy controls. Between-group comparison Z maps showing  differences in activation between childhood-onset SLE patients and controls were  generated, using a significance level of P < 0.05 in a general linear model.  RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the childhood-onset SLE group showed  statistically significant increased activation of brain areas involved in the CPT,  N-Back, and verb generation tasks. In contrast, in the absence of active stimulus,  e.g., during times of the paradigm control tasks, childhood-onset SLE patients  consistently undersuppressed activity in the expected brain areas. Activation in  selected cortical areas was found to correlate negatively with results of a subset  of individual neuropsychological test scores. CONCLUSION: FMRI abnormalities are  present in childhood-onset SLE, manifesting as an imbalance between active and  inhibitory responses to an array of stimuli.

Although previous studies have shown that lateralized long-term memory  processes in the medial temporal lobes are modified in subjects with atypical  (right) language dominance, the effect of language dominance on the neural basis of  working memory (WM) has remained unknown. Here, we used functional MRI (fMRI) to  study the impact of language dominance on the neural representation of WM. We  conducted an n-back task in three different load conditions and with both verbal and  nonverbal (spatial) material in matched groups of left and right language dominant  subjects. This approach allowed us to investigate regions showing significant  interactions between language dominance and material. Overall, right dominant  subjects showed an increased inter-individual variability of WM-related activations.  Verbal WM involved more pronounced activation of the left fusiform cortex in left  dominant subjects and of the right inferior parietal lobule in the right dominant  group. Spatial WM, on the other hand, induced activation of right hemispheric  regions in left dominant subjects, but no specific activations in right dominant  subjects. Taken together, these findings indicate that the neural basis of verbal WM  processes depends on language dominance and is more mutable in right dominant  subjects. The increased variability in right dominant subjects strongly suggests  that a standard network of material-dependent WM processes exists in left dominant  subjects, and that right dominant subjects use variable alternative networks.",Jul-09,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,2032-2043,NA,7,30,NA,Hum Brain Mapp,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,"Copyright 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 18711708  PMCID: PMC6870824,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/3U3NU3IQ/Axmacher et al. - 2009 - Working memory representation in atypical language.pdf,NA,"Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Brain Mapping; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Brain/*physiology; Analysis of Variance; *Language; Space Perception/physiology; Speech; *Functional Laterality",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Axmacher et al. - 2009 - Working memory representation in atypical language.pdf

We have shown previously that visual working memory benefits only from  intra-modal visual but not from across-modal auditory working memory training. In  the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study we examined whether auditory  working memory processes can also be trained specifically and which training-induced  activation changes accompany theses effects. It was investigated whether working  memory training with strongly distinct auditory materials transfers exclusively to  an auditory (intra-modal) working memory task or whether it generalizes to a  (across-modal) visual working memory task. We used adaptive n-back training with  tonal sequences and a passive control condition. The memory training led to a  reliable training gain. Transfer effects were found for the (intra-modal) auditory  but not for the (across-modal) visual transfer task. Training-induced activation  decreases in the auditory transfer task were found in two regions in the right  inferior frontal gyrus. These effects confirm our previous findings in the visual  modality and extents intra-modal effects in the prefrontal cortex to the auditory  modality. As the right inferior frontal gyrus is frequently found in maintaining  modality-specific auditory information, these results might reflect increased neural  efficiency in auditory working memory processes. Furthermore, task-unspecific  (amodal) activation decreases in the visual and auditory transfer task were found in  the right inferior parietal lobule and the superior portion of the right middle  frontal gyrus reflecting less demand on general attentional control processes.

Earlier family studies have suggested that deficits in executive  cognition and working memory may be related to genetic susceptibility for  schizophrenia, but the biological basis for this behavioral phenotype has not been  identified. METHOD: The authors used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)  during performance of the N-back working memory task to assess working  memory-related cortical physiology in nonschizophrenic, cognitively intact siblings  of patients with schizophrenia. They compared 23 unaffected siblings of  schizophrenic patients to 18 matched comparison subjects. As a planned replication,  they studied another 25 unaffected siblings and 15 comparison subjects. RESULTS: In  both cohorts, there were no group differences in working memory performance.  Nevertheless, both groups of siblings showed an exaggerated physiological response  in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that was qualitatively similar to  results of earlier fMRI studies of patients with schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: These  fMRI data provide direct evidence of a primary physiological abnormality in  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex function in individuals at greater genetic risk for  schizophrenia, even in the absence of a manifest cognitive abnormality. This  exaggerated fMRI response implicates inefficient processing of memory information at  the level of intrinsic prefrontal circuitry, similar to earlier findings in patients  with schizophrenia. These data predict that inheritance of alleles that contribute  to inefficient prefrontal information processing will increase risk for  schizophrenia.",Apr-03,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,709-719,NA,4,160,NA,Am J Psychiatry,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States PMID: 12668360,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/DSTDUTNP/Callicott et al. - 2003 - Abnormal fMRI response of the dorsolateral prefron.pdf,NA,"Humans; Female; Male; Phenotype; Adult; Cohort Studies; Risk Factors; Neuropsychological Tests; Prefrontal Cortex/*physiology; Schizophrenic Psychology; Cognition/*physiology; Memory/physiology; Polymorphism, Genetic; Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*statistics & numerical data; *Siblings; Catechol O-Methyltransferase/genetics; Cognition Disorders/diagnosis/genetics; Functional Laterality/genetics/physiology; Schizophrenia/*diagnosis/*genetics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Callicott et al. - 2003 - Abnormal fMRI response of the dorsolateral prefron.pdf

We examined neural circuitry supporting emotion  regulation in females with either BDd or UDd as a first stage toward identifying  biomarkers that may differentiate BDd from UDd. METHOD: Fifty-seven females aged  18-45 years participated in this study: 23 with UDd, 18 with bipolar disorder type I  depression (BDId) and 16 healthy females. During 3-T functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI), the participants performed an emotional face n-back (EFNBACK) task,  that is an n-back task with high (2-back) and low (0-back) memory load conditions  flanked by two positive, negative or neutral face distracters. This paradigm  examines executive control with emotional distracters-emotion regulation. RESULTS:  High memory load with neutral face distracters elicited greater bilateral and left  dorsal anterior midcingulate cortex (dAMCC) activity in UDd than in healthy and BDId  females respectively, and greater bilateral putamen activity in both depressed  groups versus healthy females. High memory load with happy face distracters elicited  greater left putamen activity in UDd than in healthy females. Psychotropic  medication was associated with greater putamen activity to these contrasts in UDd  females. CONCLUSIONS: During high memory load with neutral face distracters,  elevated dAMCC activity in UDd suggests abnormal recruitment of attentional control  circuitry to maintain task performance, whereas elevated putamen activity unrelated  to psychotropic medication in BDId females may suggest an attentional bias toward  ambiguous neutral face distracters. Differential patterns of functional  abnormalities in neural circuitry supporting attentional control during emotion  regulation, especially in the dAMCC, is a promising neuroimaging measure to  distinguish UDd from BDId in females.",Jul-12,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,1417-1428,NA,7,42,NA,Psychol Med,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 22099606  PMCID: PMC3601380,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/SBTFSIRB/Bertocci et al. - 2012 - Abnormal anterior cingulate cortical activity duri.pdf,NA,"Humans; Female; Adolescent; Adult; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Neuropsychological Tests; Brain Mapping/methods; Executive Function/*physiology; Task Performance and Analysis; Attention/physiology; Facial Expression; Cues; Benzodiazepines/therapeutic use; *Emotions; Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use; Bipolar Disorder/diagnosis/drug therapy/*physiopathology; Depressive Disorder/diagnosis/drug therapy/*physiopathology; Diagnosis, Differential; Gyrus Cinguli/drug effects/*physiopathology; Putamen/drug effects/physiopathology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Bertocci et al. - 2012 - Abnormal anterior cingulate cortical activity duri.pdf

The purpose of the present  study was to examine amygdala response to threatening faces among healthy siblings  of schizophrenia patients in whom a subtler heritable deficit might be observed.  METHOD: Participants were 34 schizophrenia patients, 29 unaffected siblings, and 20  healthy comparison subjects. Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic  resonance imaging (fMRI) was conducted during an implicit facial information  processing task. The N-back working memory task, which has been shown to elicit  prefrontal cortex abnormalities in unaffected siblings of schizophrenia patients,  was employed as a positive experimental control.

We studied six normal subjects  performing a working memory paradigm (n-back tasks) associated with different levels  of monetary reward during an fMRI session. The study showed specific brain  activation in relation with changes in both the cognitive loading and the reward  associated with task performance. First, the working memory tasks activated a  network including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [Brodmann area (BA) 9/46] and,  in addition, in the lateral frontopolar areas (BA 10), but only in the more  demanding condition (3-back task). This result suggests that lateral prefrontal  areas are organized in a caudo-rostral continuum in relation with the increase in  executive requirement. Second, reward induces an increased activation in the areas  already activated by working memory processing and in a supplementary region, the  medial frontal pole (BA 10), regardless of the level of cognitive processing. It is  postulated that the latter region plays a specific role in monitoring the reward  value of ongoing cognitive processes. Third, we detected areas where the signal  decreases (ventral-BA 11/47 and subgenual prefrontal cortices) in relation with both  the increase of cognitive demand and the reward. The deactivation may represent an  emotional gating aimed at inhibiting adverse emotional signals to maximize the level  of performance.

Yet, direct  neurobiological evidence is scarce. Twenty-four adolescents (12-16) and 28 adults  (25-35) completed an emotional n-back working memory task in response to happy,  angry, and neutral faces during fMRI. Importantly, participants either paid  attention to the emotion (task-relevant condition) or judged the gender  (task-irrelevant condition).

The  catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor tolcapone, an FDA-approved treatment  for Parkinson's disease, increases prefrontal dopamine levels, with cognitive  benefits that may vary by COMT genotype. We tested whether tolcapone alters working  memory-related brain activity and performance in abstinent smokers. METHODS: In this  double-blind crossover study, 20 smokers completed 8 days of treatment with  tolcapone and placebo. In both medication periods, smokers completed blood oxygen  level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI scans while performing a working memory N-back task  after 24h of abstinence. Smokers were genotyped prospectively for the COMT  val(158)met polymorphism for exploratory analysis. RESULTS: Compared to placebo,  tolcapone modestly improved accuracy (p=0.017) and enhanced suppression of  activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) (p=0.002). There were no  effects of medication in other a priori regions of interest (dorsolateral PFC,  dorsal cingulate/medial prefrontal cortex, or posterior cingulate cortex).  Exploratory analyses suggested that tolcapone led to a decrease in BOLD signal in  several regions among smokers with val/val genotypes, but increased or remained  unchanged among met allele carriers. Tolcapone did not attenuate craving, mood, or  withdrawal symptoms compared to placebo.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may help identify neural  mechanisms underlying these deficits. Neuroimaging studies of healthy adults have  characterized responses associated with increased VWM demands during the n-Back  task, suggesting that this experimental paradigm could help identify neural  correlates of VWM deficits among MS patients. Fifteen MS patients and 15 matched  control participants completed the n-Back during whole-brain fMRI. Mean signal  during adjacent 0-Back blocks was subtracted, on a voxel-wise basis, from mean  signal observed during n-Back blocks. Resulting difference scores for 1-, 2-, and  3-Back were compared across groups and difficulty levels. Signal intensity was  positively related to difficulty level in anterior regions, including premotor,  supplementary motor, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. MS patients exhibited  significantly greater intensity in these areas compared to controls during the  1-Back, while portions of the left superior frontal gyrus, cingulate, and  parahippocampal gyri were relatively less intense at more difficult levels. MS group  responses were slower during the 1-Back and tended to be slower during the 3-Back;  however, accuracy did not differ at any level. Lesion load was positively related to  only 1-Back activity and unrelated to any performance measure. Results suggest that  compensatory activity occurs among MS patients matched on performance accuracy.  Furthermore, compensatory activity occurs predominantly in regions associated with  VWM, and this may decline relative to controls as task demands increase. These  findings may help to explain why MS patient performance decreases as a function of  effort on neuropsychological tests.",Jan-06,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,28-36,NA,1,27,NA,Hum Brain Mapp,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,"Hum Brain Mapp, 2005.

Examination of the pattern of behavioral responding and the temporal course of  activations suggests that WM deficits in moderate-to-severe TBI are due to  associative or strategic aspects of WM, and not impairments in active maintenance of  stimulus representations.

RESULTS: In subjects with OTCD we observed increased BOLD signal  in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex  (ACC) relative to healthy age matched controls.

METHOD: We studied 15 healthy control subjects (HC) and 15 unmedicated remitted  depressed patients (rMDD). Participants performed a verbal working memory task of  varying cognitive load (n-back) while undergoing fMRI. We used multiple regression  analyses to assess overall capacity (1-, 2-, 3-back versus 0-back) as well as  quadratic modulation of cognitive demand. RESULTS: Performance accuracy and response  latency did not differ between groups, and overall capacity was similar. However,  rMDD showed a positive quadratic load response in the bilateral hippocampus; the  converse was true for HC.

To test this, we addressed the possible interaction between cognitive  task performance and endogenous fMRI oscillations in an experiment designed to  answer two questions: 1) Does performance of a cognitively effortful task  significantly change fractal scaling properties of fMRI time series compared to  their values before task performance? 2) If so, can we relate the extent of  task-related perturbation to the difficulty of the task? METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL  FINDINGS: Using a novel continuous acquisition ""rest-task-rest"" design, we found  that endogenous dynamics tended to recover their pre-task parameter values  relatively slowly, over the course of several minutes, following completion of one  of two versions of the n-back working memory task and that the rate of recovery was  slower following completion of the more demanding (n = 2) version of the task.  CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This result supports the model that endogenous low  frequency oscillatory dynamics are relevant to the brain's response to exogenous  stimulation. Moreover, it suggests that large-scale neurocognitive systems measured  using fMRI, like the heart and other physiological systems subjected to external  demands for enhanced performance, can take a considerable period of time to return  to a stable baseline state.",2009-08-14,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,e6626,NA,8,4,NA,PLoS One,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 19680553  PMCID: PMC2721686,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/UYFJMVPQ/Barnes et al. - 2009 - Endogenous human brain dynamics recover slowly fol.pdf,NA,Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain/*physiology; *Cognition; Task Performance and Analysis; Memory; Fractals,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Barnes et al. - 2009 - Endogenous human brain dynamics recover slowly fol.pdf

A small number of  studies have also shown that relatively short exposure to blue light leads to  changes in functional brain responses during the period of exposure. The extent to  which blue light continues to affect brain functioning during a cognitively  challenging task after cessation of longer periods of exposure (i.e., roughly 30  minutes or longer), however, has not been fully investigated. METHODS: A total of 35  healthy participants (18 female) were exposed to either blue (469 nm) (n = 17) or  amber (578 nm) (n = 18) wavelength light for 30 minutes in a darkened room, followed  immediately by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while undergoing a  working memory task (N-back task). RESULTS: Participants in the blue light condition  were faster in their responses on the N-back task and showed increased activation in  the dorsolateral (DLPFC) and ventrolateral (VLPFC) prefrontal cortex compared to  those in the amber control light condition. Furthermore, greater activation within  the VLPFC was correlated with faster N-back response times. CONCLUSIONS: This is the  first study to suggest that a relatively brief, single exposure to blue light has a  subsequent beneficial effect on working memory performance, even after cessation of  exposure, and leads to temporarily persisting functional brain changes within  prefrontal brain regions associated with executive functions. These findings may  have broader implication for using blue-enriched light in a variety of work settings  where alertness and quick decision-making are important.",2016-09-01,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,1671-1680,NA,9,39,NA,Sleep,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,"© 2016 Associated Professional Sleep Societies, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 27253770  PMCID: PMC4989256,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/V26H62BK/Alkozei et al. - 2016 - Exposure to Blue Light Increases Subsequent Functi.pdf,NA,"Humans; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Young Adult; Brain Mapping; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; *fMRI; *working memory; *N-back task; Reaction Time/physiology; Attention/physiology; *functional magnetic resonance imaging; *prefrontal cortex; Prefrontal Cortex/diagnostic imaging/*physiology; *amber light; *blue light; *Light; *PFC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Alkozei et al. - 2016 - Exposure to Blue Light Increases Subsequent Functi.pdf

The technique provides individual, rather than  group-averaged, functional neuroimaging data, but subtle methodological confounds  represent unique challenges for psychiatric research. As an exemplar of the unique  potential and problems of fMRI, we present a study of 10 inpatients with  schizophrenia and 10 controls performing a novel ""n back"" working memory (WM) task.  We emphasize two key design steps: (1) the use of an internal activation standard  (i.e., a physiological control region) to address activation validity, and (2) the  assessment of signal stability to control for ""activation"" artifacts arising from  unequal signal variance across groups. In the initial analysis, all but one of the  patients failed to activate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during the  working memory task. However, some patients (and one control) also tended to show  sparse control region activation in spite of normal motor performance, a result that  raises doubts about the validity of the initial analysis and concerns about unequal  subject motion. Subjects were then matched for signal variance (voxel stability),  producing a subset of six patients and six controls. In this comparison, the  internal activation standard (i.e., motor activation) was similar in both groups,  and five of six patients, including two whom were neuroleptic-naive, failed to  activate DLPFC. In addition, a tendency for overactivation of parietal cortex was  seen. These results illustrate some of the promise and pitfalls of fMRI.

These cognitive impairments  have been linked to increased risk for relapse. Little is known about individual  differences in the cognitive impairments that accompany deprivation or the neural  processing reflected in those differences. In order to address this knowledge gap,  we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 118  nicotine-deprived smokers while they performed a verbal n-back task. We predicted  better performance would be associated with more efficient patterns of brain  activation and effective connectivity. Results indicated that performance was  positively related to load-related activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal  cortex and the left lateral premotor cortex. Additionally, effective connectivity  patterns differed as a function of performance, with more accurate participants  having simpler, more parsimonious network models than did worse participants.  Cognitive efficiency is typically thought of as less neural activation for equal or  superior behavioral performance. Taken together, findings suggest cognitive  efficiency should not be viewed solely in terms of amount of activation but that  both the magnitude of activation within and degree of covariation between  task-critical structures must be considered. This research highlights the benefit of  combining traditional fMRI analysis with newer methods for modeling brain  connectivity.

Schizophrenia patients  with or without past SA either showed no significant differences, or patients with  past SA showed somewhat less activation compared to patients without past SA during  WM. These results suggest robust effects of past SA on WM brain functioning in  controls, but less impact of past SA in schizophrenia.

Working memory capacity was studied  using a parametric 'n-back' working memory task involving increasing cognitive load  and ultimately decreasing task performance. Loci within dorsolateral prefrontal  cortex (DLPFC) evinced exclusively an 'inverted-U' shaped neurophysiological  response from lowest to highest load, consistent with a capacity-constrained  response. Regions outside of DLPFC, in contrast, were more heterogeneous in response  and often showed early plateau or continuously increasing responses, which did not  reflect capacity constraints. However, sporadic loci, including in the premotor  cortex, thalamus and superior parietal lobule, also demonstrated putative  capacity-constrained responses, perhaps arising as an upstream effect of DLPFC  limitations or as part of a broader network-wide capacity limitation.

In rodents, such effects  are mediated by stress-induced alterations in catecholaminergic signaling, but human  data in support of this notion is lacking. A common variation in the gene encoding  Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is known to affect basal catecholaminergic  availability and PFC functions. Here, we investigated whether this genetic variation  (Val158Met) modulates effects of stress on WM-related neural activity in humans. In  a counterbalanced crossover design, 41 healthy young men underwent functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a numerical N-back WM task  embedded in a stressful or neutral context. Moderate psychological stress was  induced by a well-controlled procedure involving viewing strongly aversive (versus  emotionally neutral) movie material in combination with a self-referencing  instruction. Acute stress resulted in genotype-dependent effects on WM performance  and WM-related activation in the dorsolateral PFC, with a relatively negative impact  of stress in COMT Met-homozygotes as opposed to a relatively positive effect in  Val-carriers. A parallel interaction was found for WM-related deactivation in the  anterior medial temporal lobe (MTL). Our findings suggest that individuals with  higher baseline catecholaminergic availability (COMT Met-homozygotes) appear to  reach a supraoptimal state under moderate levels of stress. In contrast, individuals  with lower baselines (Val-carriers) may reach an optimal state. Thus, our data show  that effects of acute stress on higher-order cognitive functions vary depending on  catecholaminergic availability at baseline, and thereby corroborate animal models of  catecholaminergic signaling that propose a non-linear relationship between  catecholaminergic activity and prefrontal functions.",2012,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,16,NA,,6,NA,Front Integr Neurosci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 22593737  PMCID: PMC3350069,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/UZCXU8SR/Qin et al. - 2012 - The effect of moderate acute psychological stress .pdf,NA,fMRI; working memory; prefrontal cortex; stress; Catechol-O-methyltransferase; catecholamine,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Qin et al. - 2012 - The effect of moderate acute psychological stress .pdf

However, there have been few studies of adults  at genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease prior to the onset of symptoms. The purpose  of this study was to determine whether brain activation patterns associated with  working memory differ as a function of apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype in  cognitively intact adults. METHOD: Participants were cognitively intact, healthy  adults who completed genotyping, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and  structural and functional neuroimaging. Twenty-two participants had the APOE  epsilon3/epsilon3 genotype, and 13 participants had the APOE epsilon3/epsilon4  genotype. The study employed an auditory verbal N-back task to probe working  memory-related brain activity. RESULTS: The epsilon3/epsilon3 and epsilon3/epsilon4  groups did not differ in demographic characteristics, cognitive ability, mood, or  in-scanner task performance. The epsilon3/epsilon4 group showed greater activity  during working memory in the medial frontal and parietal regions bilaterally and in  the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. There were no regions in which the  epsilon3/epsilon3 group showed greater activation than the epsilon3/epsilon4 group.  CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that differences in brain activity are evident  in cognitively intact individuals who are at risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease  by virtue of their APOE allele status.

Elevated brain iron in old age may trigger brain dysfunction and concomitant  cognitive decline. However, the exact mechanism underlying the deleterious impact of  iron on brain function in aging is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of iron  on brain function across the adult lifespan from 187 healthy participants (20-79  years old, 99 women) who underwent fMRI scanning while performing a working-memory  n-back task. Iron content was quantified using R2* relaxometry, whereas  neuroinflammation was estimated using myo-inositol measured by magnetic resonance  spectroscopy. Striatal iron increased non-linearly with age, with linear increases  at both ends of adulthood. Whereas higher frontostriatal activity was related to  better memory performance independent of age, the link between brain activity and  iron differed across age groups. Higher striatal iron was linked to greater  frontostriatal activity in younger, but reduced activity in older adults. Further  mediation analysis revealed that, after age 40, iron provided unique and shared  contributions with neuroinflammation to brain activations, such that  neuroinflammation partly mediated brain-iron associations.

Furthermore, at low difficulty levels, decreases in BOLD response were found after  WM training.

METHODS: Sixty  healthy volunteers were orally administered either 20 mg of methylphenidate (N = 29)  or placebo (N = 31) in a double-blind, randomized, between-subject design.  Multi-echo fMRI was used to assess intrinsic functional connectivity of sub-regions  of the thalamus during a resting state scan. An N-back working-memory paradigm  provided a measure of cognitive performance. RESULTS: Acute methylphenidate  significantly reduced connectivity of the lateral prefrontal cortex with the motor  and somatosensory sub-regions of the thalamus and reduced connectivity with the  parietal and visual sub-regions at a trend level. Connectivity with the premotor,  prefrontal, and temporal sub-regions was not impacted. The intrinsic connectivity  between the thalamus and the lateral prefrontal cortex was not associated with  working-memory performance. CONCLUSIONS: Methylphenidate decreases functional  connections between the lateral prefrontal cortex and thalamus broadly, while  sparing intrinsic connectivity with thalamic sub-regions involved with  working-memory and language related processes. Collectively, our results suggest  that the dopamine transporter regulates functional connections between the  prefrontal cortex and non-cognitive areas of the thalamus.",Jun-20,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,1873-1883,NA,6,237,NA,Psychopharmacology (Berl),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 32307560  PMCID: PMC7437544,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/HZ99MTY3/Gorka et al. - 2020 - Intrinsic connections between thalamic sub-regions.pdf,NA,"Humans; Dopamine; Female; Male; Adult; Young Adult; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods; Healthy Volunteers; Memory, Short-Term/*drug effects/physiology; Double-Blind Method; Prefrontal cortex; Acute methylphenidate; Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors/administration & dosage; Intrinsic functional connectivity; Methylphenidate/*administration & dosage; Nerve Net/diagnostic imaging/*drug effects/physiology; Prefrontal Cortex/diagnostic imaging/*drug effects/physiology; Resting state fMRI; Thalamus; Thalamus/diagnostic imaging/*drug effects/physiology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Gorka et al. - 2020 - Intrinsic connections between thalamic sub-regions.pdf

Here, a functional polymorphism in the NPSR1 gene  has been linked to deviant cortico-limbic interactions in response to negative  stimuli. While healthy T allele carriers exhibited increased amygdala and prefrontal  cortex activity, panic disorder patients carrying the T risk allele displayed  hypofrontality possibly reflecting insufficient prefrontal inhibition of limbic  reactivity. In order to study multi-level effects of genotype and anxiety,  prefrontal cortex activity during an emotional n-back task was measured in 66  volunteers genotyped for the NPSR1 rs324981 A/T variant (AA homozygotes vs. T allele  carriers) by means of functional near-infrared spectroscopy. For a high working  memory load (3-back), T allele carriers showed a signal increase to negative  pictures in the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex while AA homozygotes  displayed a signal decrease. Since groups did not differ on skin conductance level  and behavioral parameters, this effect in the risk group in line with results from  fMRI studies is speculated to represent an adaptive mechanism to compensate for  presumably increased subcortical activity driven by an overactive NPS system.  However, anxiety sensitivity correlated negatively with prefrontal activity in T  allele carriers possibly suggesting a decompensation of the adaptive compensatory  upregulation.",Dec-15,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,1730-1737,NA,12,10,NA,Soc Cogn Affect Neurosci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,"© The Author (2015).

However,  little is known about how exposure to cannabis cues and contexts may influence  cognitive control and the underlying neural mechanisms in cannabis users.  OBJECTIVES: Working memory (WM) is an attention reliant executive function central  to cognitive control. In this study, we investigated how distracting cannabis words  affected WM load-dependent performance and related brain activity in near-daily  cannabis users (N = 36) relative to controls (N = 33). METHODS: Brain activity was  recorded during a novel N-back flanker WM task with neutral and cannabis flankers  added as task-irrelevant distractors. RESULTS: On a behavioural level, WM  performance did not differ between groups, and the presence of cannabis flankers did  not affect performance. However, in cannabis users compared to controls, the  presence of cannabis flankers reduced WM load-related activity in multiple regions,  including the insula, thalamus, superior parietal lobe and supramarginal gyrus.  CONCLUSIONS: The group specificity of these effects suggest that cannabis users  might differ from controls in the way they process cannabis-related cues and that  cannabis cue exposure could interfere with other cognitive processes under  cognitively demanding circumstances. Future studies should focus on the role of  context in cognitive control-related processes like WM and attention to further  elucidate potential cognitive impairments in heavy cannabis users and how these  relate to loss of control over drug seeking itself.",2021-08-27,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,,NA,,,NA,Psychopharmacology (Berl),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,© 2021.

The purpose of this study was to  examine brain activity in youth at varying stages of risk for SMI using functional  magnetic resonance imaging tasks (fMRI) that engage brain systems believed to be  affected. METHODS: Two hundred and forty three participants at different stages of  risk for SMI were recruited to the Canadian Psychiatric Risk and Outcome (PROCAN)  study, however only 179 were scanned. Stages included asymptomatic participants at  no elevated risk, asymptomatic participants at elevated risk due to family history,  participants with undifferentiated general symptoms of mental illness, and those  experiencing attenuated versions of diagnosable psychiatric illnesses. The fMRI  tasks included: (1) a monetary incentive delay task; (2) an emotional Go-NoGo and  (3) an n-back working memory task. RESULTS: Strong main effects with each of the  tasks were found in brain regions previously described in the literature. However,  there were no significant differences in brain activity between any of the stages of  risk for SMI for any of the task contrasts, after accounting for site, sex and age.  Furthermore, results indicated no significant differences even when participants  were dichotomized as asymptomatic or symptomatic.

To date, it  remains unknown how these distributed regions are systemically organized at the  connectome level and how the disruption of such organization brings about the WM  impairment seen in schizophrenia. METHODS: We used graph theory to examine the  neural efficiency of the functional connectome in different granularity in 155  patients with schizophrenia and 96 healthy controls during a WM task. These analyses  were repeated in another independent dataset (81 patients and 54 controls). Linear  regression analysis was used to test associations of altered graph properties,  clinical symptoms, and WM accuracy in patients. A machine-learning approach was  adopted to study the ability of multivariate connectome features from one dataset to  discriminate patients from controls in the second dataset. RESULTS: Small-worldness  of the whole-brain connectome was significantly increased in schizophrenia during  the WM task; this increase is related to better (though subpar) WM accuracy in  patients with more severe negative symptom burden. There was a shift in the degree  distribution to a more homogeneous form in patients. The machine-learning approach  classified a new set of patients from controls with 84.3% true-positivity rate for  schizophrenia and 71.6% overall accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a putative  mechanistic link between connectome topology, hub redistribution, and impaired  n-back performance in schizophrenia. The task-dependent modulation of the connectome  relates to, but remains inefficient in, improving the performance above par in the  presence of severe negative symptoms.",2020-07-08,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,916-926,NA,4,46,NA,Schizophr Bull,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,"© The Author(s) 2020.

Interpreting abstract  speech and integrating nonverbal modalities is particularly affected. Considering  the impact of communication on social life but failure to treat communication  dysfunctions with usual treatment, we will investigate the possibility to improve  verbal and non-verbal communication in schizophrenia by applying a multimodal  speech-gesture training (MSG training). Here we describe the newly developed MSG  training program and the study design for the first clinical investigation. The  intervention contains perceptive rating (match/mismatch of sentence and gesture) and  memory tasks (n-back tasks), imitation and productive tasks (e.g., SG  fluency-similar to verbal fluency where words are accompanied by gesture). In  addition, we offer information about gesture as meta-learning element as well as  homework for reasons of transfer to everyday life as part of every session. In the  MSG training intervention, we offer eight sessions (60 min each) of training. The  first pilot study is currently conducted as a single-center, randomized controlled  trial of speech-gesture intervention versus wait-list control with a follow-up.  Outcomes are measured through pre-post-fMRI and standardized psychological  questionnaires comparing two subject groups (30 patients with schizophrenia and 30  healthy controls). Patients and healthy controls are randomized in two intervention  groups (with 20 being in the wait-training group and 10 in the training-follow-up  group). With our study design we will be able to demonstrate the beneficial effect  of the MSG training intervention on behavioral and neural levels.

In this trial, for the first time, we test the  proof-of-concept of whether the acute and training effects of aerobic exercise on  working memory and brain network connectivity are related in the same participants.  METHODS: Cognitively normal older participants (N = 34) were enrolled in a  randomized clinical trial (NCT02453178). Participants completed fMRI resting state  and a face working memory N-back task acutely after light- and moderate-intensity  exercises and after a 12-wk aerobic training intervention. RESULTS: Functional  connectivity did not change more after moderate-intensity training compared with  light-intensity training. However, both training groups showed similar changes in  cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) (maximal exercise oxygen uptake, V˙O2peak), limiting  group-level comparisons. Acute effects of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on  connections primarily in the default network predicted training enhancements in the  same connections. Working memory also improved acutely, especially after  moderate-intensity, and greater acute improvements predicted greater working memory  improvement with training. Exercise effects on functional connectivity of right  lateralized frontoparietal connections were related to both acute and training gains  in working memory.

The present study examined  task-related brain activity, connectivity and individual variability in  fMRI-measured neural response during an SWM task in older youth and young adults  with autism and clinically significant EF impairment. METHODS: Neuroimaging was  analyzed in 29 individuals with ASD without intellectual disability who had  clinically significant EF impairment on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive  Function, and 20 typically developing controls (participant age range=16-34). An SWM  N-Back task was performed during fMRI. SWM activity (2-Back vs. 0-Back) and  task-related dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) connectivity was examined within  and between groups. Variability of neural response during SWM was also examined.  RESULTS: During SWM performance both groups activated the expected networks, and no  group differences in network activation or task-related DLPFC-connectivity were  found. However, greater individual variability in the pattern of SWM activity was  found in the ASD versus the typically developing control group. CONCLUSIONS: While  there were no group differences in SWM task-evoked activity or connectivity,  fronto-parietal network engagement was found to be more variable/idiosyncratic in  ASD.

In this study, we analyzed data of over 1,000 children from  the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study to examine whether  monolinguals and multilinguals differ in executive function, functional brain  connectivity, and brain-behavior associations. We observed significantly better  performance from multilingual children than monolinguals in working-memory tasks. In  one finding, we were able to classify multilinguals from monolinguals using only  their whole-brain functional connectome at rest and during an emotional n-back task.  Compared to monolinguals, the multilingual group had different functional  connectivity mainly in the occipital lobe and subcortical areas during the emotional  n-back task and in the occipital lobe and prefrontal cortex at rest. In contrast, we  did not find any differences in behavioral performance and functional connectivity  when performing a stop-signal task. As a second finding, we investigated the degree  to which behavior is reflected in the brain by implementing a connectome-based  behavior prediction approach. The multilingual group showed a significant  correlation between observed and connectome-predicted individual working-memory  performance scores, while the monolingual group did not show any correlations.

Because many women who use MA during pregnancy also use alcohol, a known  teratogen, we examined 50 children (age range 7-15), 19 with prenatal MA exposure,  15 of whom had concomitant prenatal alcohol exposure (the MAA group), 13 with heavy  prenatal alcohol but no MA exposure (ALC group), and 18 unexposed controls (CON  group). We hypothesized that MA exposed children would demonstrate abnormal brain  activation during a visuospatial working memory (WM) ""N-Back"" task. As predicted,  the MAA group showed less activation than the CON group in many brain areas,  including the striatum and frontal lobe in the left hemisphere. The ALC group showed  less activation than the MAA group in several regions, including the right striatum.  We found an inverse correlation between performance and activity in the striatum in  both the CON and MAA groups. However, this relationship was significant in the  caudate of the CON group but not the MAA group, and in the putamen of the MAA group  but not the CON group.

Furthermore, studies in nonhuman primates (NHP) have suggested that  intermittent administration of low doses of D1R agonists produce long-lasting  reversals in cognitive deficits. The purpose of this trial was to test whether a  similar design, involving subacute intermittent administration of low doses of a  full, selective agonist at D1Rs, DAR-0100A, would improve cognitive deficits in SCZ.  METHODS: We randomized 49 clinically stable individuals with SCZ to three weeks of  intermittent treatment with 0.5 mg or 15 mg of DAR-0100A, or placebo (normal  saline). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) BOLD was used to evaluate the  effects of drug administration on brain activity during a working memory (WM) task.  Effects on cognition were also assessed using the MATRICS and the N-back task as  primary endpoints. The CogState battery was used as a secondary endpoint. RESULTS:  There were no observed treatment effects on either the BOLD fMRI signal during WM  tasks or the WM domains of the MATRICS. Moderate improvement was detected on the  CogState battery and on the attention domain of the MATRICS. CONCLUSION: These  results suggest that low doses of D1 agonists that do not result in measureable  occupancy of the D1R do not reliably improve cognition in SCZ, unlike the  observations in NHP. As this drug is limited by its pharmacokinetic profile, better  D1R agonists that can achieve adequate levels of D1R occupancy are needed to test  the efficacy of this mechanism for cognitive enhancement in SCZ.",May-16,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,428-435,NA,5,30,NA,J Psychopharmacol,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,© The Author(s) 2016.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States PMID: 26966119,NA,"/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/W2UUTULQ/Girgis et al. - 2016 - A proof-of-concept, randomized controlled trial of.pdf",NA,"Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; *schizophrenia; Double-Blind Method; Memory, Short-Term/drug effects; Cognition/drug effects; Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use; *cognitive enhancement; *DAR-0100A; *dopamine-1 agonist; *randomized controlled trial; Attention/drug effects; Cerebral Cortex/drug effects/metabolism; Cognition Disorders/drug therapy/metabolism; Dopamine Agonists/*therapeutic use; Dopamine/*metabolism; Nootropic Agents/*therapeutic use; Phenanthridines/*therapeutic use; Receptors, Dopamine D1/*agonists; Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/metabolism",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Girgis et al. - 2016 - A proof-of-concept, randomized controlled trial of.pdf"

How these abnormalities relate to  different probabilities for later transition to psychosis is unclear. We  investigated vulnerability- versus disease-related versus resilience biomarkers of  psychosis during working memory (WM) processing in individuals with an at-risk  mental state (ARMS). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with ""first-episode psychosis""  (FEP, n = 21), short-term ARMS (ARMS-ST, n = 17), long-term ARMS (ARMS-LT, n = 16),  and healthy controls (HC, n = 20) were investigated with an n-back WM task. We  examined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and structural magnetic  resonance imaging (sMRI) data in conjunction using biological parametric mapping  (BPM) toolbox. PRINCIPAL OBSERVATIONS: There were no differences in accuracy, but  the FEP and the ARMS-ST group had longer reaction times compared with the HC and the  ARMS-LT group. With the 2-back > 0-back contrast, we found reduced functional  activation in ARMS-ST and FEP compared with the HC group in parietal and middle  frontal regions. Relative to ARMS-LT individuals, FEP patients showed decreased  activation in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and insula, and in the left  prefrontal cortex. Compared with the ARMS-LT, the ARMS-ST subjects showed reduced  activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus and insula. Reduced insular and  prefrontal activation was associated with gray matter volume reduction in the same  area in the ARMS-LT group.

Working  memory-related and long-term memory-related changes in this population are not well  understood. The objective of this study was to demonstrate that cancer-related  cognitive impairments are associated with the under recruitment of brain regions  involved in working and recognition memory compared with controls. METHODS: Oncology  patients (n = 15) who were receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and had evidence of  cognitive impairment according to neuropsychological testing and self-report and a  group of age-matched, education group-matched, cognitively normal control  participants (n = 14) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging. During  functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants performed a nonverbal n-back  working memory task and a visual recognition task. RESULTS: On the working memory  task, when 1-back and 2-back data were averaged and contrasted with 0-back data,  significantly reduced activation was observed in the right dorsolateral prefrontal  cortex for oncology patients versus controls. On the recognition task, oncology  patients displayed decreased activity of the left-middle hippocampus compared with  controls. Neuroimaging results were not associated with patient-reported cognition.  CONCLUSIONS: Decreased recruitment of brain regions associated with the encoding of  working memory and recognition memory was observed in the oncology patients compared  with the control group. These results suggest that there is a reduction in neural  functioning postchemotherapy and corroborate patient-reported cognitive difficulties  after cancer treatment, although a direct association was not observed.

In humans, weekly Epo administration over 3 months improves cognitive  function in schizophrenia. The neural underpinnings and time-course of this effect  of Epo are currently unknown. It is also unclear whether the cognitive improvement  reflects direct neurobiological actions or is secondary to hematological effects. We  therefore assessed the actions of single administration of Epo (40,000 IU) vs.  saline to healthy volunteers on cognitive and neural measures of executive function  using a verbal fluency task and N-back working memory (WM) paradigm during  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on day 3 and 7 after administration in  two separate cohorts of subjects. Epo modulated neuronal response in a  fronto-parietal network during WM performance at both time points; on day 3 after  administration, activation was increased in left-hemisphere frontal and cingulate  cortex and reduced in the right parietal cortex; in contrast, neural response was  enhanced in a right-lateralized fronto-parietal network and reduced in left-side  regions 1 week post-administration. In addition, Epo-treated volunteers displayed  improved verbal fluency performance 1 week post-administration.

It has been reported to be high in flavonoids  and might potentially improve brain activity among older adults with mild cognitive  impairment (MCI). The effect of CC in brain activation improvement using  neuroimaging is yet to be discovered. PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of CC  supplement on brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)  among older adults with MCI. STUDY TYPE: Prospective, randomized, double-blind,  placebo-controlled trial. POPULATION/SUBJECTS: Twenty older adults with mild  cognitive impairment (60-75 years old), 14 of them (70%) were female subjects. FIELD  STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: A 3.0-T, T1-weighted anatomical images, T2*-weighted imaging  data, A single shot, gradient echo-echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence. ASSESSMENT:  All subjects were asked to consume two 500 mg capsules of either CC supplement or  placebo (maltodextrin) daily for 12 weeks. Cognitive function was measured using  validated neuropsychological tests (i.e. Mini-mental State Examination and Digit  Span) and task-based fMRI (N-back and Stroop Color Word Test) at baseline and 12th  week. Brodmann's area 9, 46 and anterior cingulate cortex were selected as the  regions of interest to define dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in fMRI  analysis. STATISTICAL TESTS: Normality test was performed with the Shapiro-Wilk  test. Two-way repeated ANOVA determined the intervention effects of the CC  supplementation on brain activity after adjustments for covariates. Significance  level at P < 0.05 for independent-t test and Chi square test; adjusted P < 0.0042  for two-way repeated ANOVA after Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: Findings showed  significant improvements in digit span (partial η(2)  = 0.559), increment in right  DLPFC activation while performing 1-back task (partial η(2)  = 0.586) and left DLPFC  activation while performing Stroop Color Word Test (SCWT) (congruent) task (partial  η(2)  = 0.432) at 12th week of CC supplementation. CONCLUSION: CC supplementation  might have the ability to improve DLPFC activation, potentially leading to improved  working memory among older adults with MCI after 12 weeks of administration.

Cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging,NA,2451-9030 2451-9022,10.1016/j.bpsc.2020.10.018,NA,"BACKGROUND: There is emerging evidence for abnormal beta oscillations in psychosis. Beta oscillations are likely to play a key role in the coordination of sensorimotor  information that is crucial to healthy mental function. Growing evidence suggests  that beta oscillations typically manifest as transient beta bursts that increase in  probability following a motor response, observable as post-movement beta rebound.  Evidence indicates that post-movement beta rebound is attenuated in psychosis, with  greater attenuation associated with greater symptom severity and impairment.  Delineating the functional role of beta bursts therefore may be key to understanding  the mechanisms underlying persistent psychotic illness. METHODS: We used concurrent  electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify blood  oxygen level-dependent correlates of beta bursts during the n-back working memory  task and intervening rest periods in healthy control participants (n = 30) and  patients with psychosis (n = 48). RESULTS: During both task blocks and intervening  rest periods, beta bursts phasically activated regions implicated in task-relevant  content while suppressing currently tonically active regions. Patients showed  attenuated post-movement beta rebound that was associated with persisting  disorganization symptoms as well as impairments in cognition and role function.  Patients also showed greater task-related reductions in overall beta burst rate and  showed greater, more extensive, beta burst-related blood oxygen level-dependent  activation. CONCLUSIONS: Our evidence supports a model in which beta bursts  reactivate latently maintained sensorimotor information and are dysregulated and  inefficient in psychosis. We propose that abnormalities in the mechanisms by which  beta bursts coordinate reactivation of contextually appropriate content can manifest  as disorganization, working memory deficits, and inaccurate forward models and may  underlie a core deficit associated with persisting symptoms and impairment.",Dec-21,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,1145-1156,NA,12,6,NA,Biol Psychiatry Cogn Neurosci Neuroimaging,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,Copyright © 2020 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

Patients with HIV commonly have deficits  in working memory and attention, which may negatively impact many other cognitive  domains, leading to HAND. Since HAND may lead to loss of independence in activities  of daily living and negative emotional well-being, and incur a high economic burden,  effective treatments for HAND are urgently needed. This study aims to determine  whether adaptive working memory training might improve cognitive functions and  neural network efficiency and possibly decrease neuroinflammation. This study also  aims to assess whether subjects with the LMX1A-rs4657412 TT(AA) genotype show  greater training effects from working memory training than TC(AG) or  CC(GG)-carriers. METHODS/DESIGN: 60 HIV-infected and 60 seronegative control  participants will be randomized to a double-blind active-controlled study, using  adaptive versus non-adaptive Cogmed Working Memory Training® (CWMT), 20-25 sessions  over 5-8 weeks. Each subject will be assessed with near- and far-transfer cognitive  tasks, self-reported mood and executive function questionnaires, and  blood-oxygenation level-dependent functional MRI during working memory (n-back) and  visual attention (ball tracking) tasks, at baseline, 1-month, and 6-months after  CWMT. Furthermore, genotyping for LMX1A-rs4657412 will be performed to identify  whether subjects with the TT(AA)-genotype show greater gain or neural efficiency  after CWMT than those with other genotypes. Lastly, cerebrospinal fluid will be  obtained before and after CWMT to explore changes in levels of inflammatory proteins  (cytokines and chemokines) and monoamines. DISCUSSION: Improving working memory in  HIV patients, using CWMT, might slow the progression or delay the onset of HAND.  Observation of decreased brain activation or normalized neural networks, using fMRI,  after CWMT would lead to a better understanding of how neural networks are modulated  by CWMT. Moreover, validating the greater training gain in subjects with the  LMX1A-TT(AA) genotype could lead to a personalized approach for future working  memory training studies. Demonstrating and understanding the neural correlates of  the efficacy of CWMT in HIV patients could lead to a safe adjunctive therapy for  HAND, and possibly other brain disorders.

METHOD: This was a six-week, double-blind, randomized trial of risperidone  plus placebo versus divalproex plus placebo for patients with mania (n = 21; 13.6 ±  2.5 years of age). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) outcomes were  measured using a block design, affective, N-back task with angry, happy, and neutral  face stimuli at baseline and at 6-week follow-up. Matched healthy controls (HC; n =  15, 14.5 ± 2.8 years) were also scanned twice. RESULTS: In post hoc analyses on the  significant interaction in a 3×2×2 analysis of variance (ANOVA) that included  patient groups and HC, the risperidone group showed greater activation after  treatment in response to the angry face condition in the left subgenual anterior  cingulate cortex (ACC) and striatum relative to the divalproex group. The divalproex  group showed greater activation relative to the risperidone group in the left  inferior frontal gyrus and right middle temporal gyrus. Over the treatment course,  the risperidone group showed greater change in activation in the left ventral  striatum than the divalproex group, and the divalproex group showed greater  activation change in left inferior frontal gyrus and right middle temporal gyrus  than the risperidone group. Furthermore, each patient group showed increased  activation relative to HC in fronto-striato-temporal regions over time. The happy  face condition was potentially less emotionally challenging in this study and did  not elicit notable findings. CONCLUSIONS: When patients performed a working memory  task under emotional duress inherent in the paradigm, divalproex enhanced activation  in a fronto-temporal circuit whereas risperidone increased activation in the  dopamine (D₂) receptor-rich ventral striatum.

To this end,  we re-analysed an fMRI dataset of 41 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 42  healthy controls performing a numerical n-back working-memory task. In our  generative-embedding approach, we used parameter estimates from a dynamic causal  model (DCM) of a visual-parietal-prefrontal network to define a model-based feature  space for the subsequent application of supervised and unsupervised learning  techniques. First, using a linear support vector machine for classification, we were  able to predict individual diagnostic labels significantly more accurately (78%)  from DCM-based effective connectivity estimates than from functional connectivity  between (62%) or local activity within the same regions (55%). Second, an  unsupervised approach based on variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture modelling  provided evidence for two clusters which mapped onto patients and controls with  nearly the same accuracy (71%) as the supervised approach. Finally, when restricting  the analysis only to the patients, Gaussian mixture modelling suggested the  existence of three patient subgroups, each of which was characterised by a different  architecture of the visual-parietal-prefrontal working-memory network. Critically,  even though this analysis did not have access to information about the patients'  clinical symptoms, the three neurophysiologically defined subgroups mapped onto  three clinically distinct subgroups, distinguished by significant differences in  negative symptom severity, as assessed on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale  (PANSS). In summary, this study provides a concrete example of how psychiatric  spectrum diseases may be split into subgroups that are defined in terms of  neurophysiological mechanisms specified by a generative model of network dynamics  such as DCM. The results corroborate our previous findings in stroke patients that  generative embedding, compared to analyses of more conventional measures such as  functional connectivity or regional activity, can significantly enhance both the  interpretability and performance of computational approaches to clinical  classification.",2014,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,98-111,NA,,4,NA,Neuroimage Clin,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 24363992  PMCID: PMC3863808,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/5B83FNLP/Brodersen et al. - 2014 - Dissecting psychiatric spectrum disorders by gener.pdf,NA,"Humans; Models, Statistical; Case-Control Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Schizophrenia; Brain/blood supply/*pathology; Neural Pathways/blood supply/pathology; Nonlinear Dynamics; Balanced purity; Clinical validation; Clustering; Nerve Net/blood supply/*pathology; Schizophrenia/*diagnosis; Variational Bayes",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Brodersen et al. - 2014 - Dissecting psychiatric spectrum disorders by gener.pdf

In network research in fMRI,  functional connectivity is considered as a set of pair-wise interactions between the  nodes of the network. These interactions are typically operationalized through the  full or partial correlation between all pairs of regional time series. Estimating  the structure of the latent underlying functional connectome from the set of  pair-wise partial correlations remains an open research problem though. Typically,  this thresholding problem is approached by proportional thresholding, or by means of  parametric or non-parametric permutation testing across a cohort of subjects at each  possible connection. As an alternative, we propose a data-driven thresholding  approach for network matrices on the basis of mixture modeling. This approach allows  for creating subject-specific sparse connectomes by modeling the full set of partial  correlations as a mixture of low correlation values associated with weak or  unreliable edges in the connectome and a sparse set of reliable connections.  Consequently, we propose to use alternative thresholding strategy based on the model  fit using pseudo-False Discovery Rates derived on the basis of the empirical null  estimated as part of the mixture distribution. We evaluate the method on synthetic  benchmark fMRI datasets where the underlying network structure is known, and  demonstrate that it gives improved performance with respect to the alternative  methods for thresholding connectomes, given the canonical thresholding levels. We  also demonstrate that mixture modeling gives highly reproducible results when  applied to the functional connectomes of the visual system derived from the n-back  Working Memory task in the Human Connectome Project. The sparse connectomes obtained  from mixture modeling are further discussed in the light of the previous knowledge  of the functional architecture of the visual system in humans. We also demonstrate  that with use of our method, we are able to extract similar information on the group  level as can be achieved with permutation testing even though these two methods are  not equivalent. We demonstrate that with both of these methods, we obtain functional  decoupling between the two hemispheres in the higher order areas of the visual  cortex during visual stimulation as compared to the resting state, which is in line  with previous studies suggesting lateralization in the visual processing.

Sex  differences in executive function in youth have been linked to vulnerability to  psychopathology as well as to behaviors that impinge on health, wellbeing, and  longevity. Yet, the neurobiological basis of these differences is not well  understood, in part due to the spatiotemporal complexity inherent in patterns of  brain network maturation supporting executive function. Here we test the hypothesis  that sex differences in impulsivity in youth stem from sex differences in the  controllability of structural brain networks as they rewire over development.  Combining methods from network neuroscience and network control theory, we  characterize the network control properties of structural brain networks estimated  from diffusion imaging data acquired in males and females in a sample of 879 youth  aged 8-22 years. We summarize the control properties of these networks by estimating  average and modal controllability, two statistics that probe the ease with which  brain areas can drive the network towards easy versus difficult-to-reach states. We  find that females have higher modal controllability in frontal, parietal, and  subcortical regions while males have higher average controllability in frontal and  subcortical regions. Furthermore, controllability profiles in males are negatively  related to the false positive rate on a continuous performance task, a common  measure of impulsivity. Finally, we find associations between average  controllability and individual differences in activation during an n-back working  memory task. Taken together, our findings support the notion that sex differences in  the controllability of structural brain networks can partially explain sex  differences in executive function. Controllability of structural brain networks also  predicts features of task-relevant activation, suggesting the potential for  controllability to represent context-specific constraints on network state more  generally.",Mar-19,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,122-134,NA,,188,NA,Neuroimage,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

We investigate the effect of  active and sham Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) treatment on working  memory function of patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) considering  Task Positive and Default Mode networks (TPN and DMN). METHODS: An experiment with 4  levels of visuospatial n-back task was used to investigate the pattern of cortical  activation in 17 men with moderate or severe OSAS before and after 2 months of  therapeutic (active) or sub-therapeutic (sham) CPAP treatment. RESULTS: Patients  with untreated OSAS had significantly less deactivation in the temporal regions of  the DMN as compared to healthy controls, but activation within TPN regions was  comparatively relatively preserved. After 2 months of treatment, active and sham  CPAP groups exhibited opposite trends of cerebral activation and deactivation. After  treatment, the active CPAP group demonstrated an increase of cerebral activation in  the TPN at all task levels and of task-related cerebral deactivation in the anterior  midline and medial temporal regions of the DMN at the 3-back level, associated with  a significant improvement of behavioral performance, whereas the sham CPAP group  exhibited less deactivation in the temporal regions of Default Mode Network and less  Task Positive Network activation associated to longer response times at the 3-back.  CONCLUSION: OSAS has a significant negative impact primarily on task-related DMN  deactivation, particularly in the medial temporal regions, possibly due to nocturnal  hypoxemia, as well as TPN activation, particularly in the right ventral  fronto-parietal network. After 2 months of active nasal CPAP treatment a positive  response was noted in both TPN and DMN but without compete recovery of existing  behavioral and neuronal deficits. Initiation of CPAP treatment early in the course  of the disease may prevent or slow down the occurrence of irreversible impairment.",2012,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,e47433,NA,12,7,NA,PLoS One,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 23227139  PMCID: PMC3515559,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/7XGH9BI2/Prilipko et al. - 2012 - The effects of CPAP treatment on task positive and.pdf,NA,"Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Double-Blind Method; Polysomnography; *Continuous Positive Airway Pressure; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive/*physiopathology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Prilipko et al. - 2012 - The effects of CPAP treatment on task positive and.pdf

However, there is significant  variability in cognitive dysfunction, likely reflecting biological heterogeneity. We  sought to identify neurocognitive subtypes and their neurofunctional signatures in a  large cross-sectional sample of depressed youth. Participants were drawn from the  Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, including 712 youth with a lifetime history  of a major depressive episode and 712 typically developing (TD) youth matched on age  and sex. A subset (MDD n = 368, TD n = 200) also completed neuroimaging. Cognition  was assessed with the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery. A recently developed  semi-supervised machine learning algorithm was used to delineate neurocognitive  subtypes. Subtypes were evaluated for differences in both clinical psychopathology  and brain activation during an n-back working memory fMRI task. We identified three  neurocognitive subtypes in the depressed group. Subtype 1 was high-performing (high  accuracy, moderate speed), Subtype 2 was cognitively impaired (low accuracy, slow  speed), and Subtype 3 was impulsive (low accuracy, fast speed). While subtypes did  not differ in clinical psychopathology, they diverged in their activation profiles  in regions critical for executive function, which mirrored differences in cognition.  Taken together, these data suggest disparate mechanisms of cognitive vulnerability  and resilience in depressed youth, which may inform the identification of biomarkers  for prognosis and treatment response.",Mar-21,2022-03-04 19:25,2022-03-04 19:25,NA,783-790,NA,4,46,NA,Neuropsychopharmacology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 33007777  PMCID: PMC8027806,NA,/mnt/c/Users/User/Zotero/storage/HHCXNJ8E/Baller et al. - 2021 - Neurocognitive and functional heterogeneity in dep.pdf,NA,"Humans; Adolescent; Neuropsychological Tests; Cross-Sectional Studies; Executive Function; Cognition; *Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnostic imaging",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Baller et al. - 2021 - Neurocognitive and functional heterogeneity in dep.pdf

However, the  effects of P.minor on brain activation and biomarkers have not been studied among  older adults. This multicentre, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study  aimed to investigate the effect of 6 months P.minor extract supplement (Biokesum®)  on cognition, mood, biomarkers, and brain activation among older adults with Mild  Cognitive Impairment (MCI). METHOD: A total of 36 Malaysian community-dwelling older  adults with MCI (60-75-year-old) were randomized into Biokesum® (n = 18) and placebo  group (n = 18). Each subject consumed one capsule of Biokesum® (250 mg/capsule) or  placebo (maltodextrin, 280 mg/capsule) twice daily for 6 months. Cognitive function  and mood were assessed at baseline, 3rd, and 6th-month using neuropsychological  tests (MMSE, Digit Span, RAVLT, Digit Symbol, and Visual Reproduction) and Profile  of Mood State (POMS) questionnaire. Blood lipid profile, fasting blood glucose, and  biomarkers (MDA, LPO, COX-2, iNOS, and BDNF) were measured at baseline and 6th  month. By the end of the intervention, there were 30 compliers (Biokesum®: N = 15;  Placebo: N = 15) and 6 dropouts. For brain activation assessment, 15 subsamples  (Biokesum®: N = 8; Placebo: N = 7) completed N-back and Stroop tasks during fMRI  scanning at baseline and 6th month. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's  area 9 and 46) was identified as a region of interest (ROI) for brain activation  analysis using SPM software. RESULTS: Two-way mixed ANOVA analysis showed  significant improvements in Visual Reproduction II (p = 0.012, partial  η(2) = 0.470), tension (p = 0.042, partial η(2) = 0.147), anger (p = 0.010, partial  η(2) = 0.207), confusion (p = 0.041, partial η(2) = 0.148), total negative subscales  (p = 0.043, partial η(2) = 0.145), BDNF (p = 0.020, partial η(2) = 0.179) and  triglyceride (p = 0.029, partial η(2) = 0.237) following 6 months of Biokesum®  supplementation. Preliminary finding also demonstrated significant improvement at  0-back task-induced right DLPFC activation (p = 0.028, partial η(2) = 0.652) among  subsamples in Biokesum® group. No adverse events were reported at the end of the  study. CONCLUSION: Six months Biokesum® supplementation potentially improved visual  memory, negative mood, BDNF, and triglyceride levels among older adults with MCI.  Significant findings on brain activation at the right DPLFC must be considered as  preliminary.
