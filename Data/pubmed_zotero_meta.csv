Moreover, we know from work in neurophysiology that  the prefrontal cortex is disproportionately susceptibly to the pathological effects  of aging. The n-back task is arguably the most ubiquitous cognitive task for  investigating working memory performance. Many functional magnetic resonance imaging  (fMRI) studies examine brain regions engaged during performance of the n-back task  in adults. The current meta-analyses are the first to examine concordance and  age-related changes across the healthy adult lifespan in brain areas engaged when  performing the n-back task. We compile data from eligible fMRI articles that report  stereotaxic coordinates of brain activity from healthy adults in three age-groups:  young (23.57 ± 5.63 years), middle-aged (38.13 ± 5.63 years) and older (66.86 ± 5.70  years) adults. Findings show that the three groups share concordance in the  engagement of parietal and cingulate cortices, which have been consistently  identified as core areas involved in working memory; as well as the insula,  claustrum, and cerebellum, which have not been highlighted as areas involved in  working memory. Critically, prefrontal cortex engagement is concordant for young, to  a lesser degree for middle-aged adults, and absent in older adults, suggesting a  gradual linear decline in concordance of prefrontal cortex engagement. Our results  provide important new knowledge for improving methodology and theories of cognition  across the lifespan.","2019-08-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","16-31","","","196","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The results of those investigations,  however, vary considerably; moreover, previous meta-analyses also yielded  inconsistent findings. OBJECTIVE: To readdress aberrant brain activation in UD as  evidenced by neuroimaging experiments on cognitive and/or emotional processing. DATA  SOURCES: Neuroimaging experiments published from January 1, 1997, to October 1,  2015, were identified by a literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, and Google  Scholar using different combinations of the terms fMRI (functional magnetic  resonance imaging), PET (positron emission tomography), neural, major depression,  depression, major depressive disorder, unipolar depression, dysthymia, emotion,  emotional, affective, cognitive, task, memory, working memory, inhibition, control,  n-back, and Stroop. STUDY SELECTION: Neuroimaging experiments (using fMRI or PET)  reporting whole-brain results of group comparisons between adults with UD and  healthy control individuals as coordinates in a standard anatomic reference space  and using an emotional or/and cognitive challenging task were selected. DATA  EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Coordinates reported to show significant activation  differences between UD and healthy controls during emotional or cognitive processing  were extracted. By using the revised activation likelihood estimation algorithm,  different meta-analyses were calculated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Meta-analyses  tested for brain regions consistently found to show aberrant brain activation in UD  compared with controls. Analyses were calculated across all emotional processing  experiments, all cognitive processing experiments, positive emotion processing,  negative emotion processing, experiments using emotional face stimuli, experiments  with a sex discrimination task, and memory processing. All meta-analyses were  calculated across experiments independent of reporting an increase or decrease of  activity in major depressive disorder. For meta-analyses with a minimum of 17  experiments available, separate analyses were performed for increases and decreases.  RESULTS: In total, 57 studies with 99 individual neuroimaging experiments comprising  in total 1058 patients were included; 34 of them tested cognitive and 65 emotional  processing. Overall analyses across cognitive processing experiments (P > .29) and  across emotional processing experiments (P > .47) revealed no significant results.  Similarly, no convergence was found in analyses investigating positive (all  P > .15), negative (all P > .76), or memory (all P > .48) processes. Analyses that  restricted inclusion of confounds (eg, medication, comorbidity, age) did not change  the results. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Inconsistencies exist across individual  experiments investigating aberrant brain activity in UD and replication problems  across previous neuroimaging meta-analyses. For individual experiments, these  inconsistencies may relate to use of uncorrected inference procedures, differences  in experimental design and contrasts, or heterogeneous clinical populations;  meta-analytically, differences may be attributable to varying inclusion and  exclusion criteria or rather liberal statistical inference approaches.","2017-01-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","47-55","","1","74","","JAMA Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 27829086  PMCID: PMC5293141","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\QA848MIW\Müller et al. - 2017 - Altered Brain Activity in Unipolar Depression Revi.pdf","","Humans; Adult; Brain Mapping; Cognition/physiology; *Functional Neuroimaging; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Arousal/physiology; Brain/*physiopathology; Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/*physiopathology/psychology; Depressive Disorder/diagnosis/*physiopathology/psychology; Emotions/physiology; Likelihood Functions; Reference Values; Synaptic Transmission/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Orbitofrontal Cortex (OFC) is a cortical structure that has implications in cognition, memory, reward anticipation, outcome evaluation, decision  making, and learning. As such, OFC activity correlates with these cognitive brain  abilities. Despite research suggesting race and socioeconomic status (SES)  indicators such as parental education may be associated with OFC activity, limited  knowledge exists on multiplicative effects of race and parental education on OFC  activity and associated cognitive ability. Purpose. Using functional brain imaging  data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, we tested the  multiplicative effects of race and parental education on left lateral OFC activity  during an N-Back task. In our study, we used a sociological rather than biological  theory that conceptualizes race and SES as proxies of access to the opportunity  structure and exposure to social adversities rather than innate and non-modifiable  brain differences. We explored racial variation in the effect of parental  educational attainment, a primary indicator of SES, on left lateral OFC activity  during an N-Back task between Black and White 9-10 years old adolescents. Methods.  The ABCD study is a national, landmark, multi-center brain imaging investigation of  American adolescents. The total sample was 4290 9-10 years old Black or White  adolescents. The independent variables were SES indicators, namely family income,  parental education, and neighborhood income. The primary outcome was the average  beta weight for N-Back (2 back versus 0 back contrast) in ASEG ROI left OFC  activity, measured by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) during an N-Back  task. Ethnicity, age, sex, subjective SES, and family structure were the study  covariates. For data analysis, we used linear regression models. Results. In White  but not Black adolescents, parental education was associated with higher left  lateral OFC activity during the N-Back task. In the pooled sample, we found a  significant interaction between race and parental education on the outcome,  suggesting that high parental education is associated with a larger increase in left  OFC activity of White than Black adolescents. Conclusions. For American adolescents,  race and SES jointly influence left lateral OFC activity correlated with cognition,  memory, decision making, and learning. Given the central role of left lateral OFC  activity in learning and memory, our finding calls for additional research on  contextual factors that reduce the gain of SES for Black adolescents. Cognitive  inequalities are not merely due to the additive effects of race and SES but also its  multiplicative effects.","2021-03-22","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","","","3","11","","Brain Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 33809905  PMCID: PMC8004246","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\72KZLGUB\Assari et al. - 2021 - Parental Education and Left Lateral Orbitofrontal .pdf","","adolescents; brain development; cognitive; fMRI; learning; memory; N-Back; orbitofrontal cortex; population groups; socioeconomic factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We additionally provide an index of the  validity of the proposed paradigm and test whether the experimental task  discriminates the behavioural performances of healthy participants from those of  individuals with working memory deficits. Ten healthy participants and nine patients  presenting working memory (WM) deficits due to acquired brain injury (ABI) performed  the developed task. To inspect whether the paradigm activates brain areas typically  involved in visual working memory (VWM), brain activation of the healthy  participants was assessed with fMRIs. To examine the task's capacity to discriminate  behavioural data, performances of the healthy participants in the task were compared  with those of ABI patients. Data were analysed with GLM-based random effects  procedures and t-tests. We found an increase of the BOLD signal in the specialized  areas of VWM. Concerning behavioural performances, healthy participants showed the  predicted pattern of more hits, less omissions and a tendency for fewer false  alarms, more self-corrected responses, and faster reaction times, when compared with  subjects presenting WM impairments. The results suggest that this task activates  brain areas involved in VWM and discriminates behavioural performances of clinical  and non-clinical groups. It can thus be used as a research methodology for  behavioural and neuroimaging studies of VWM in block-design paradigms.","2017-03","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","122-134","","1","11","","J Neuropsychol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2015 The British Psychological Society.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 26083786","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\VE4SU68N\Dores et al. - 2017 - Study of behavioural and neural bases of visuo-spa.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Young Adult; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Neuropsychological Tests; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; *behavioural performance; *Brain Mapping; *functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI); *visuo-spatial n-back task; *visuo-spatial working memory; Brain/*diagnostic imaging; Discrimination, Psychological; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Oxygen/blood; Photic Stimulation; Spatial Processing/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The inter-regional connectivity among the WM regions during  task preparation has not yet been investigated. We examined this question using the  graph modeling methods IMaGES and LOFS, applied to the previously published fMRI  data of Manelis and Reder (2013). In that study, subjects performed 1-, 2-, and  3-back tasks. Each block of n-back was preceded by a preparation period and followed  by a rest period. The analyses of task-related brain activity identified a network  of 18 regions that increased in activation from 1- to 3-back (Increase network) and  a network of 17 regions that decreased in activation from 1- to 3-back (Decrease  network). The graph analyses revealed two types of connectivity sub-networks within  the Increase and Decrease networks: ""default"" and ""preparation-related."" The  ""default"" connectivity was present not only during task performance, but also during  task preparation and during rest. We propose that this sub-network may serve as a  core system that allows one to quickly activate cognitive, perceptual and motor  systems in response to the relevant stimuli. The ""preparation-related"" connectivity  was present during task preparation and task performance, but not at rest, and  depended on the n-back condition. The role of this sub-network may be to  pre-activate a connectivity ""road map"" in order to establish a top-down and  bottom-up regulation of attention prior to performance on WM tasks.","2014","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","593","","","8","","Front Hum Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 25140143  PMCID: PMC4122182","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\A9IEQWUV\Manelis and Reder - 2014 - Effective connectivity among the working memory re.pdf","","fMRI; connectivity; graph modeling; IMaGES; LOFS; task preparation; working memory; working memory network","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An fMRI study comparing verbal and abstract n-back tasks.","NeuroImage","","1095-9572 1053-8119","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.06.005","","In working memory (WM), functional imaging studies demonstrate cerebellar involvement indicating a cognitive role of the cerebellum. These cognitive  contributions were predominantly interpreted as part of the phonological loop within  the Baddeley model of WM. However, those underlying investigations were performed in  the context of visual verbal WM which could pose a bias when interpreting the  results. The aim of this fMRI study was to address the question of whether the  cerebellum supports additional aspects of WM in the context of higher cognitive  functions. Furthermore, laterality effects were investigated to further disentangle  the cerebellar role in the context of the phonological loop and the visuospatial  sketchpad. A direct comparison of verbal and abstract visual WM was performed in 17  young volunteers by applying a 2-back paradigm and extracting the % change in BOLD  signal from the fMRI data. To minimize potential verbal strategies, Attneave and  Arnoult shapes of non-nameable objects were chosen for the abstract condition. The  analyses revealed no significant differences in verbal vs. abstract WM. Moreover, no  laterality effects were demonstrated in both verbal and abstract WM. These results  provide further evidence of a broader cognitive involvement of the cerebellum in WM  that is not only confined to the phonological loop but also supports central  executive subfunctions. The fact that no lateralization effects are found might be  attributed to the characteristics of the n-back paradigm which emphasizes central  executive subfunctions over the subsidiary slave systems.","2009-10-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","2073-2082","","4","47","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 19524048","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Brain Mapping/*methods; Cerebellum/*physiology; Language; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods; Mental Recall/*physiology; Verbal Behavior/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The impairment of working memory has been found related to the  abnormal activity of human brain regions in many functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI) studies. This study investigated how brain region activation was  altered in schizophrenia and how it was inherited independently from performance  deficits. METHOD: The authors used fMRI method during N-back task to assess working  memory related cortical activation in four groups (N = 20 in each group, matching  task performance, age, gender and education): schizophrenic patients, their  unaffected biological parents, young healthy controls for the patients and older  healthy controls for their parents. RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, patients  showed an exaggerated response in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (brodmann  area [BA] 46) and bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and had reduced  activation in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 9). In the conjunction  analysis, the effect of genetic risk (parents versus older control) shared  significantly overlapped activation with effect of disease (patients versus young  control) in the right middle frontal gyrus (BA 46) and left inferior parietal gyrus  (BA 40).

Additional to the relation between suffering from chronic stress and depression,  both stress (acute and chronic) and depression are associated with cognitive  alterations, including working memory. The breakup of a relationship is considered  to be a stressful event that can lead to symptoms of depression in otherwise healthy  people. Additional to elevated depression scores, stress-related cognitive  alterations may occur in this population as well. Therefore, in the present fMRI  study we investigated whether experiencing a relationship breakup is associated with  working memory alterations and whether this is related to depressive symptom  severity. A three workload version of the n-back task (0-back, 1-back, 2-back) was  used to measure working memory in subjects who experienced a breakup in the  preceding 6 months (""heartbreak group"", n = 70) and subjects in a romantic  relationship (""relationship group"", n = 46). Behavioral task performance was  compared between the two groups. Functional MRI scans were analyzed using General  Linear Model (GLM) activation analyses. Workload conditions were contrasted to each  other and to baseline and group differences were assessed. To investigate whether  brain networks are associated with depressive symptom severity within the heartbreak  group specifically, a post hoc feature-based Independent Component Analysis was  performed on the 2-back > 0-back contrast images to identify brain regions that  covaried across subjects. Behaviorally, the heartbreak group performed similar at  high workload (i.e., 2-back) and better at moderate workload (i.e., 1-back) than the  relationship group. GLM analysis revealed an interaction between group and 2-back >  0-back, 2-back > 1-back and 2-back > baseline; the heartbreak group showed less  precuneus activation compared to the relationship group. Furthermore, within the  heartbreak group, we found a negative association between depressive symptom  severity and a brain network representing mostly the precuneus, anterior cingulate  gyrus and supplementary motor cortex. Our findings suggest that the effect of a  breakup is accompanied by workload-dependent working memory alterations. Therefore,  we propose that this population can potentially be used to investigate the interplay  between stress, cognitive functioning and depression.","2021","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","657264","","","15","","Front Behav Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Verhallen, Renken, Marsman and ter Horst.","","","","","","PMID: 33897388  PMCID: PMC8062740","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\ZXNKXKFY\Verhallen et al. - 2021 - Working Memory Alterations After a Romantic Relati.pdf","","working memory; depressive symptoms; n-back task; relationship breakup; task-based fMRI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ten individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria for Major Depression and 10  healthy controls were tested with a verbal version of the n-back task during fMRI  scanning. The working memory load was manipulated across the experiment (1,2,3-back)  to increase the cognitive demands. fMRI data were acquired on a 1.5-T GE scanner and  analyzed using SPM99 software. We did not find any difference between groups in both  performance and reaction times for each level of complexity of the n-back task.  Depressed patients and control subjects showed bilateral activation of the lateral  prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate and parietal cortex. Activation of these  regions was modulated by the complexity of the task. Within this n-back neural  network, depressed patients showed greater activation of the lateral prefrontal  cortex and the anterior cingulate compared to healthy subjects. This study provides  evidence that depressed patients need greater activation within the same neural  network to maintain a similar level of performance as controls during a working  memory task. Our findings suggest that depression may impair the cognitive capacity  of depressed patients by recruiting more brain resources than controls during  cognitive control.","2005-07-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","860-869","","3","26","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15955496","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Middle Aged; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Brain/*physiopathology; Photic Stimulation; Cognition/*physiology; Cerebrovascular Circulation/physiology; Depressive Disorder, Major/*physiopathology/psychology; Prefrontal Cortex/physiopathology; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Psychomotor Performance/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While working memory and emotional processing-related brain function are consistently impaired in  psychoses unrelated to the puerperium, no studies have investigated them in PP.  METHODS: Twenty-four women at risk of developing PP (11 developed an episode - PE;  13 remained well - NPE) and 20 healthy postpartum women completed two functional  magnetic resonance imaging tasks within a year of delivery: working memory (n-back)  and emotional face recognition (fearful faces). We compared women at-risk of PP to  controls, as well as NPE, PE, and controls to test for potential effects of a PP  episode occurrence. RESULTS: Women at-risk of PP and PE showed hyperactivation of  lateral visual areas, precuneus, and posterior cingulate during the n-back task. The  at-risk group as a whole, as well as the PE and NPE groups, showed hyperconnectivity  of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with various  parieto-occipito-temporo-cerebellar regions compared to controls during several  n-back conditions. Increases in connectivity between the right DLPFC and ipsilateral  middle temporal gyrus were observed in the PE group compared to NPE during 2-back.  During the fearful faces task, at-risk women as a group showed hyperactivation of  fronto-cingulo-subcortical regions, and hypoconnectivity between the left amygdala  and ipsilateral occipito-parietal regions compared to controls. No significant  performance differences were observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results present  preliminary evidence of a differential nature of functional brain abnormalities in  PP compared to the typically observed reduced connectivity with the DLPFC in  psychoses unrelated to puerperium, such as bipolar disorder.","2021-07","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1724-1732","","10","51","","Psychol Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 32174288","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\GTHETMSX\Kowalczyk et al. - 2021 - Neurocognitive correlates of working memory and em.pdf","","Humans; Female; Adult; Cognition/physiology; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain/*physiopathology; *Emotional processing; *fMRI; *functional connectivity; *postpartum psychosis; *working memory; Bipolar Disorder/physiopathology; Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex; Emotions/*physiology; Facial Recognition/*physiology; Gyrus Cinguli/physiopathology; London; Parietal Lobe/physiopathology; Postpartum Period/*psychology; Psychotic Disorders/diagnosis/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neuroimaging provides a means of linking these  brain-behaviour relations, as task protocols can be adapted for use with young  children to assess the development of cognitive functions in both typical and  atypical populations. This paper reviews some of our research using  magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional MRI (fMRI) in the study of cognitive  development, with a focus on frontal lobe functions. Working memory for complex  abstract patterns showed clear development in terms of the recruitment of frontal  regions, seen with fMRI, with indications of strategy differences across the age  range, from 6 to 35 years of age. Right hippocampal involvement was also evident in  these n-back tasks, demonstrating its involvement in recognition in simple working  memory protocols. Children born very preterm (7 to 9 years of age) showed reduced  fMRI activation particularly in the precuneus and right hippocampal regions relative  to control children. In a large normative n-back study (n=90) with upright and  inverted faces, MEG data also showed right hippocampal activation that was present  across the age range; frontal sources were evident only from 10 years of age. Other  studies have investigated the development of set shifting, an executive function  that is often deficit in atypical populations. fMRI showed recruitment of frontal  areas, including the insula, that have significantly different patterns in children  (7 to 14 years of age) with autism spectrum disorder compared to typically  developing children, indicating that successful performance implicated differing  strategies in these two groups of children. These types of studies will help our  understanding of both normal brain-behaviour development and cognitive dysfunction  in atypically developing populations.","2012-02","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","19-25","","1-2","42","","Neurophysiol Clin","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

It is unclear whether patients with a first depressive episode (FDE)  exhibit the same signal changes as patients with recurrent depressive episodes  (RDE). METHODS: We investigated seventy-four MDD inpatients (48 RDE, 26 FDE) and 74  healthy control (HC) subjects performing an n-back WM task (0-back, 2-back, 3-back  condition) in a 3T-fMRI. RESULTS: FMRI analyses revealed deviating BOLD signal in  MDD in the thalamus (0-back vs. 2-back), the angular gyrus (0-back vs. 3-back), and  the superior frontal gyrus (2-back vs. 3-back). Further effects were observed  between RDE vs. FDE. Thus, RDE displayed differing neural activation in the middle  frontal gyrus (2-back vs. 3-back), the inferior frontal gyrus, and the precentral  gyrus (0-back vs. 2-back). In addition, both HC and FDE indicated a linear  activation trend depending on task complexity. CONCLUSIONS: Although we failed to  find behavioral differences between the groups, results suggest differing BOLD  signal in fronto-parietal brain regions in MDD vs. HC, and in RDE vs. FDE. Moreover,  both HC and FDE show similar trends in activation shapes. This indicates a link  between levels of complexity-dependent activation in fronto-parietal brain regions  and the stage of MDD. We therefore assume that load-dependent BOLD signal during WM  is impaired in MDD, and that it is particularly affected in RDE. We also suspect  neurobiological compensatory mechanisms of the reported brain regions in (working)  memory functioning.","2018-06-08","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","39-49","","Pt A","84","","Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Functional  magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography provide complementary  spatiotemporal information and simultaneous recording of these two modalities can  remove inter-session drug response and environment variability. We sought to assess  the effects of ketamine and midazolam on simultaneous electrophysiological and  hemodynamic recordings during working memory (WM) processes. Thirty participants  were included in a placebo-controlled, three-way crossover design with ketamine and  midazolam. Compared to placebo, ketamine administration attenuated theta power  increases and alpha power decreases and midazolam attenuated low beta band decreases  to increasing WM load. Additionally, ketamine caused larger blood-oxygen-dependent  (BOLD) signal increases in the supplementary motor area and angular gyrus, and  weaker deactivations of the default mode network (DMN), whereas no difference was  found between midazolam and placebo. Ketamine administration caused positive  temporal correlations between frontal-midline theta (fm-theta) power and the BOLD  signal to disappear and attenuated negative correlations. However, the relationship  between fm-theta and the BOLD signal from DMN areas was maintained in some  participants during ketamine administration, as increasing theta strength was  associated with stronger BOLD signal reductions in these areas. The presence of, and  ability to manipulate, both positive and negative associations between the BOLD  signal and fm-theta suggest the presence of multiple fm-theta components involved in  WM processes, with ketamine administration disrupting one or more of these  theta-linked WM strategies.","2021-11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","863-880","","6","34","","Brain Topogr","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021.

However, the relation of these rapid changes in  functional organization to cognitive functioning is not well understood. This study  used a graph-based time-frame modularity analysis approach to identify temporally  recurrent functional configuration patterns in neural responses to an n-back working  memory task during fMRI. Working memory load was manipulated to investigate the  functional relevance of the identified brain states. Four distinct brain states were  defined by the predominant patterns of activation in the task-positive,  default-mode, sensorimotor, and visual networks. Associated with escalating working  memory load, the occurrence of the task-positive state and the probability of  transitioning into this state increased. In contrast, the occurrence of the  default-mode and sensorimotor states and the probability of these 2 states  transitioning away from the task-positive state decreased. The task-positive state  occurrence rate and the probability of transitioning from the default-mode state  back to the task-positive state explained a significant and unique portion of the  variance in task performance. The results demonstrate that dynamic brain activities  support successful cognitive functioning and may have heuristic value for  understanding abnormal cognitive functioning associated with multiple  neuropsychiatric disorders.","2021-03-05","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","2125-2138","","4","31","","Cereb Cortex","","","","","","","","eng","Published by Oxford University Press 2020.","","","","","","PMID: 33258911  PMCID: PMC7945029","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\KNQ3HCDR\Gu et al. - 2021 - Temporal Dynamics of Functional Brain States Under.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Time Factors; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Cognition/*physiology; Psychomotor Performance/*physiology; *fMRI; *working memory; Memory, Short-Term/physiology; *dynamic brain state; *time-frame modularity analysis; Brain/*diagnostic imaging/*physiology; Nerve Net/*diagnostic imaging/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We recruited 29 adolescents (13-17 years) with non-lesional epilepsy and  20 healthy controls. All participants performed an N-back fMRI task and  neuropsychological testing. A general linear model approach was used to create group  activation maps of N-back fMRI for epilepsy and control groups and both groups  combined (p < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons). Functionally defined regions  of interest (ROIs) were identified based on clusters of combined group activation  (z > 5). Subsets of these functional ROIs corresponding to cingulo-opercular and  fronto-parietal networks were selected and differences in functional connectivity  between the epilepsy and control groups were assessed. Adolescents with epilepsy had  significantly poorer working memory scores compared to controls. For the N-back fMRI  task, there were no significant differences in group activation. Functional  connectivity was significantly reduced between the left frontal operculum and  anterior cingulate gyrus (cingulo-opercular network) in adolescents with epilepsy  compared to controls. This study demonstrates working memory deficits and an altered  pattern of connectivity in brain networks supporting working memory in adolescents  with epilepsy. Working memory performance was worse in adolescents with epilepsy;  though scores were not directly correlated with reduced connectivity. These results  suggest the neural substrates of working memory in adolescents with epilepsy may  differ from those in typically-developing adolescents, and require further  investigation to understand the reasons for poorer working memory performance.","2021-10","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","2513-2523","","5","15","","Brain Imaging Behav","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021.

Here, we aimed to describe the functional  and structural brain characteristics of older individuals, particularly focusing on  those with stable working memory (WM) performance, as measured with a verbal N-back  task across a 2-year follow-up interval. Forty-seven subjects were categorized as  stables or decliners based on their WM change. Stables were further subdivided into  high performers (SHP) and low performers (SLP), based on their baseline scores. At  both time points, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were acquired, including  task-based functional MRI (fMRI) and structural T1-MRI. Although there was no  significant interaction between overall stables and decliners as regards fMRI  patterns, decliners exhibited over-activation in the right superior parietal lobule  at follow-up as compared to baseline, while SHP showed reduced the activity in this  region. Further, at follow-up, decliners exhibited more activity than SHP but in  left temporo-parietal cortex and posterior cingulate (i.e., non-task-related areas).  Also, at the cross-sectional level, SLP showed lower activity than SHP at both time  points and less activity than decliners at follow-up. Concerning brain structure, a  generalized significant cortical thinning over time was identified for the whole  sample. Notwithstanding, the decliners evidenced a greater rate of atrophy  comprising the posterior middle and inferior temporal gyrus as compared to the  stable group. Overall, fMRI data suggest unsuccessful compensation in the case of  decliners, shown as increases in functional recruitment during the task in the  context of a loss in WM performance and brain atrophy. On the other hand, among  older individuals with WM cognitive stability, differences in baseline performance  might determine dissimilar fMRI trajectories. In this vein, the findings in the SHP  subgroup support the brain maintenance hypothesis, suggesting that stable and high  WM performance in aging is sustained by functional efficiency and maintained brain  structure rather than compensatory changes.","2020-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","375-386","","1","225","","Brain Struct Funct","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 31873799","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\F4MUQFW7\Vaqué-Alcázar et al. - 2020 - Functional and structural correlates of working me.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Aged; Brain Mapping; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Working memory; Aging; Aging/*physiology/*psychology; Brain stability; Brain/*anatomy & histology/*physiology; Cortical thickness (CTh); Cross-Sectional Studies; Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); Organ Size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Simultaneous EEG-fMRI is a popular multimodal recording approach due to  the complementary spatiotemporal relationship between the two modalities. Several  data fusion techniques have been proposed in the literature for EEG-fMRI fusion,  including joint-ICA and parallel-ICA frameworks. Previous EEG-fMRI fusion approaches  have used sensor-level EEG features. Recently, we introduced source-space ICA for  EEG-MEG source reconstruction and component identification, which was shown to be a  superior alternative to sensor-space ICA. APPROACH: Here, we extend source-space ICA  to the fusion of EEG-fMRI data. Additionally, we incorporate the use of a paradigm  signal (constrained) and a lag-based signal decomposition approach to accommodate  recent findings demonstrating the potentially variable lag structure between  electrophysiological and BOLD signals. We evaluated this method on simulated  concurrent EEG-fMRI during a boxcar task design, as well as real concurrent EEG-fMRI  data from three participants performing an N-Back working memory task. The block  diagram of the algorithm and corresponding source codes are provided. MAIN RESULTS:  Based on the results of the real working memory task, for all three subjects, one  frontal theta component, and one right posterior alpha component had the highest  contribution coefficients (~0.5) to the paradigm-related fused component. There were  also two more alpha band components with contribution coefficients of 0.3.

Most  of this work has been conducted in fMRI, but functional near-infrared spectroscopy  (fNIRS) is gaining traction as a less invasive and more flexible alternative to  measuring cortical hemodynamics. Few fNIRS studies, however, have examined how  working memory load-dependent changes in brain hemodynamics relate to performance.  The current study employs a newly developed and robust statistical analysis of  task-based fNIRS data in a large sample, and demonstrates the utility of  data-driven, multivariate analyses to link brain activation and behavior in this  modality. Seventy participants completed a standard N-back task with three N-back  levels (N = 1, 2, 3) while fNIRS data were collected from frontal and parietal  cortex. Overall, participants showed reliably greater fronto-parietal activation for  the 2-back versus the 1-back task, suggesting fronto-parietal fNIRS measurements are  sensitive to differences in cognitive load. The results for 3-back were much less  consistent, potentially due to poor behavioral performance in the 3-back task. To  address this, a multivariate analysis (behavioral partial least squares, PLS) was  conducted to examine the interaction between fNIRS activation and performance at  each N-back level. Results of the PLS analysis demonstrated differences in the  relationship between accuracy and change in the deoxyhemoglobin fNIRS signal as a  function of N-back level in eight mid-frontal channels. Specifically, greater  reductions in deoxyhemoglobin (i.e., more activation) were positively related to  performance on the 3-back task, unrelated to accuracy in the 2-back task, and  negatively associated with accuracy in the 1-back task. This pattern of results  suggests that the metabolic demands correlated with neural activity required for  high levels of accuracy vary as a consequence of task difficulty/cognitive load,  whereby more automaticity during the 1-back task (less mid-frontal activity)  predicted superior performance on this relatively easy task, and successful  engagement of this mid-frontal region was required for high accuracy on a more  difficult and cognitively demanding 3-back task. In summary, we show that fNIRS  activity can track working memory load and can uncover significant associations  between brain activity and performance, thus opening the door for this modality to  be used in more wide-spread applications.","2021-04-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","117795","","","230","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021.

Using data from the Human  Connectome Project, this study concurrently investigated neurocognitive performance,  neural activation during a working memory task, and cortical brain morphometry in  relation to obesity in a group of young adults, 22-35 years old. METHODS: Using a  case-control design, obese individuals (n = 243, body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/m(2))  were compared to a control group of lean BMI individuals (n = 469,  BMI = 18-24.9 kg/m(2)). Performance tests comprised a battery of behavioral  neurocognitive assessments. Neural activity was measured as  blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) activity during an N-Back task using  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Cortical morphometry included indices  of volume, thickness, and surface area. RESULTS: Relative to the control group, the  obese group exhibited significantly worse performance in terms of the National  Institutes of Health Toolkit (NIH) 9-Hole Peg Board, Penn Working Memory Test, Delay  Discounting, Penn Progressive Matrices, NIH Picture Vocabulary Test, Dimensional  Change Card Sort Test and the in-scanner N-Back working memory test (FDR-corrected  ps<0.05; ds = 0.231-0.405). The obese group also exhibited significantly greater  BOLD activation in N-Back task-negative regions, including the ventromedial  prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, and right precentral gyrus (FDR-corrected  ps<0.05). Supplemental functional connectivity analyses provided evidence that the  implicated regions were part of the default mode network. Significant differences in  morphometry were present in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, rostral anterior  cingulate cortex, inferior and superior parietal gyri, and temporal pole  (FDR-corrected p<0.001). A data-driven integrative model classified 73.8% of  participants correctly. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This multimodal investigation  suggests diverse aspects of neurocognition are associated with obesity, particularly  implicating deficits in executive function and ineffective suppression of the  default mode network.","2019","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","102015","","","24","","Neuroimage Clin","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019.

Ovarian steroid hormones, such as progesterone and estradiol, modulate emotion processing and memory.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to  examine the relationship between endogenous hormonal concentration and brain  activity during emotion processing in the context of a WM n-back task in 74 young  women using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results show that positive  emotion processing activates reward-related areas, such as the caudate and putamen,  whereas negative emotion processing activates a corticolimbic network, including the  amygdala and hippocampus. Furthermore, our findings provide evidence that  progesterone modulates more bottom-up brain activation during both positive and  negative emotion processing, whereas estradiol activates lateralized, top-down  regulation. These findings provide insight on the neural correlates of emotion  processing during an n-back task in young women and highlight how important it is to  consider women's endogenous hormonal concentration in neurobiological and cognition  research.","2021-10","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1026-1038","","5","21","","Cogn Affect Behav Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021.

Here, we first characterize two whole-brain  functional connectivity networks based on fMRI data acquired during an n-back task  that robustly predict individual differences in two important forms of LTM,  recognition and recollection. We then focus on the recognition memory model and  contrast it with a working memory model. Although functional connectivity during the  n-back task also predicts working memory performance and the two networks have some  shared components, they are also largely distinct from each other: The recognition  memory model performance remains robust when we control for working memory, and vice  versa. Functional connectivity only within regions traditionally associated with LTM  formation, such as the medial temporal lobe and those that show univariate  subsequent memory effect, have little predictive power for both forms of LTM.  Interestingly, the interactions between these regions and other brain regions play a  more substantial role in predicting recollection memory than recognition memory.  These results demonstrate that individual differences in LTM are dependent on the  configuration of a whole-brain functional network including but not limited to  regions associated with LTM during encoding and that such a network is separable  from what supports the retention of information in working memory.","2021-10-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","2279-2296","","11","33","","J Cogn Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","","","","","","PMID: 34272957  PMCID: PMC8497062","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\IZF24Z3Q\Lin et al. - 2021 - Functional Connectivity during Encoding Predicts I.pdf","","Humans; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain/diagnostic imaging; Memory, Short-Term; *Individuality; *Memory, Long-Term","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study illustrates the cross-sectional  relationships between cardiorespiratory fitness, gait speed, hand dexterity, and  muscular strength with working memory task (N-back task) performance and the  mediating effects of task-evoked functional activity in 1033 adults aged between 22  and 37 years. The results showed that cardiorespiratory fitness and hand dexterity  were independently associated with N-back task performance to a greater extent and  in contrast to gait speed and muscular strength. These relationships were mediated  by task-evoked functional activity in a part of the frontoparietal network (FPN) and  default mode network (DMN). Superior cardiorespiratory fitness could contribute to  working memory performance by enhancing the compensational role of FPN-related  broader region activation. Hand dexterity was associated with moderation of the  interaction in terms of task-evoked activation between the FPN and DMN, which in  turn, improved N-back task performance.

Forty-six healthy volunteers (23 training and 23 controls) were  asked to perform the N-back task during three fMRI scanning sessions: (1) before  training, (2) after the half of training sessions, and (3) at the end. Between the  scanning sessions, the experimental group underwent a 10-session training of working  memory with the use of an adaptive version of the N-back task, while the control  group did not train anything. The N-back task in the scanning sessions was  relatively easy (n = 2) in order to ensure high accuracy and a lack of between-group  differences at the behavioral level. Such training-induced differences in neural  efficiency were expected. Behavioral analyses revealed improved performance of both  groups on the N-back task. However, these improvements resulted from the test-retest  effect, not the training outside scanner. Performance on the non-trained stop-signal  task did not demonstrate any transfer effect. Imaging analysis showed changes in  activation in several significant clusters, with overlapping regions of interest in  the frontal and parietal lobes. However, patterns of between-session changes of  activation did not show any effect of training. The only finding that can be linked  with training consists in strengthening the correlation between task performance  accuracy and activation of the parietal regions of the neural network subserving  working memory (left superior parietal lobule and right supramarginal gyrus  posterior).

We propose a  sparse learner based on the residual errors along the estimation of an inverse  problem for extreme learning machine (ELM). Our proposed method is able to overcome  the overlearning problem by pruning several redundant features and their  corresponding output weights.

METHOD: PET and fMRI scans were obtained from women  with prospectively confirmed PMDD and asymptomatic comparison subjects while they  completed the n-back task during three hormone conditions: ovarian suppression  induced by the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist leuprolide acetate, leuprolide  plus estradiol, and leuprolide plus progesterone. Fifteen patients and 15 matched  comparison subjects underwent PET imaging. Fourteen patients and 14 comparison  subjects underwent fMRI. For each hormone condition, rCBF was measured with [15O]H2O  PET, and BOLD signal was measured with fMRI, both during an n-back working memory  paradigm. Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF) scores and clinical  characteristics were obtained for each patient before hormone manipulation, and  symptoms were measured before and during the protocol. RESULTS: In both the PET and  fMRI studies, a main effect of diagnosis was observed, with PMDD patients showing  greater prefrontal activation than comparison subjects. In the patient group, the  degree to which dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation was abnormally increased  correlated with several dimensions of disease: disability as indicated by GAF  scores, age at symptom onset, duration of PMDD, and differences in pre- and  postmenses PMDD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal working memory activation in PMDD,  specifically in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, is related to PMDD severity,  symptoms, age at onset, and disease burden. These results support the clinical  relevance of the findings and the proposal that dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  dysfunction represents a substrate of risk for PMDD.

Clinical","","2213-1582","10.1016/j.nicl.2022.102936","","BACKGROUND: People with traumatic brain injury (TBI) often experience fatigue, but an understanding of the neural underpinnings of fatigue following TBI is still  lacking. This study used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging  (rs-fMRI) to examine associations between functional connectivity (FC) changes and  task-induced changes in subjective fatigue in people with moderate-severe TBI.  METHODS: Sixteen people with moderate-severe TBI and 17 matched healthy controls  (HC) performed an adaptive N-back task (working memory task) to induce cognitive  fatigue. Before and after the task they rated their state fatigue level and  underwent rs-fMRI. Seed-to-voxel analyses with seeds in areas involved in cognitive  fatigue, namely the striatum and default mode network (DMN) including, medial  prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, were performed. RESULTS: The  adaptive N-back task was effective in inducing fatigue in both groups. Subjective  task-induced fatigue was positively associated with FC between striatum and  precuneus in people with TBI, while there was a negative association in HC. In  contrast, subjective task-induced fatigue was negatively associated with FC between  striatum and cerebellum in the TBI group, while there was no association in HC.  Similar associations between task-induced subjective fatigue and DMN FC were found  across the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the subjective experience  of fatigue was linked to DMN connectivity in both groups and was differently  associated with striatal connectivity in people with moderate-severe TBI compared to  HC. Defining fatigue-induced neuronal network changes is pertinent to the  development of treatments that target abnormal neuronal activity after TBI.","2022","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","102936","","","33","","Neuroimage Clin","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the sub-acute administration of an antidepressant  (escitalopram) would induce differences in cognitive performance and associated  brain function, which could be observed within the normal power of a functional  imaging study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy adults (N=10) received a short course  of escitalopram (10 mg/day for 7 days). Participants performed a parametric working  memory (WM) task during BOLD fMRI, both while medication-free and after medication.  To control for order effects, the medication-free examination was completed by half  the subjects before starting medication and by the other half at least one week  after medication. RESULTS: Escitalopram had no significant effect on WM accuracy or  reaction time. Preliminary analysis of the imaging data revealed no significant  (p(corrected)<0.05) differences in memory-load-dependent activation between  conditions. However, small volume correction analysis of regions that were  significant prior to correction for multiple comparisons highlighted between  condition differences in regions likely to be susceptible to antidepressant effects  (i.e. thalamus, anterior cingulate and inferior frontal gyrus). CONCLUSIONS: These  results suggest that the sub-acute administration of antidepressants in healthy  controls does not affect cognitive or hemodynamic function in healthy adults to a  magnitude greater than one standard deviation unit. Therefore, the confounding  effect of antidepressants on signal intensity in imaging studies of medicated,  depressed individuals may be limited.","2006-04","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","339-347","","3","185","","Psychopharmacology (Berl)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 16525858","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\ZTIG28RM\Rose et al. - 2006 - The effects of escitalopram on working memory and .pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Cross-Over Studies; Antidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects; Brain/*drug effects/physiology; Citalopram/administration & dosage/*adverse effects; Cognition/*drug effects; Drug Administration Schedule; Memory/*drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, for over 100 years, researchers have been unable to identify an objective,  behavioral measure that covaries with the subjective experience of fatigue. Previous  work suggests that the metrics of signal detection theory (SDT)-response bias  (criterion) and perceptual certainty (d')-may change as a function of fatigue, but  no work has yet been done to examine whether these metrics covary with fatigue.  Here, we investigated cognitive fatigue using SDT. We induced fatigue through  repetitive performance of the n-back working memory task, while functional magnetic  resonance imaging (fMRI) data was acquired. We also assessed cognitive fatigue at  intervals throughout. This enabled us to assess not only whether criterion and d'  covary with cognitive fatigue but also whether similar patterns of brain activation  underlie cognitive fatigue and SDT measures. Our results show that both criterion  and d' were correlated with changes in cognitive fatigue: as fatigue increased,  subjects became more conservative in their response bias and their perceptual  certainty declined. Furthermore, activation in the striatum of the basal ganglia was  also related to cognitive fatigue, criterion, and d'. These results suggest that SDT  measures represent an objective measure of cognitive fatigue. Additionally, the  overlap and difference in the fMRI results between cognitive fatigue and SDT  measures indicate that these measures are related while also separate. In sum, we  show the relevance of SDT measures in the understanding of fatigue, thus providing  researchers with a new set of tools with which to better understand the nature and  consequences of cognitive fatigue.","2020","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","579188","","","11","","Front Psychol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Wylie, Yao, Sandry and DeLuca.","","","","","","PMID: 33519595  PMCID: PMC7844088","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\KNRV57AS\Wylie et al. - 2020 - Using Signal Detection Theory to Better Understand.pdf","","fMRI; working memory; cognitive fatigue; signal detection theory; striatum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we  investigated whether fMRI connectivity at rest and during active tasks is  informative of the functional organization of human AC. Identical pitch-varying  sounds were presented during a visual discrimination (i.e. no directed auditory  attention), pitch discrimination, and two versions of pitch n-back memory tasks.  Analysis based on fMRI connectivity at rest revealed a network structure consisting  of six modules in supratemporal plane (STP), temporal lobe, and inferior parietal  lobule (IPL) in both hemispheres. In line with the primate model, in which  higher-order regions have more longer-range connections than primary regions, areas  encircling the STP module showed the highest inter-modular connectivity.  Multivariate pattern analysis indicated significant connectivity differences between  the visual task and rest (driven by the presentation of sounds during the visual  task), between auditory and visual tasks, and between pitch discrimination and pitch  n-back tasks. Further analyses showed that these differences were particularly due  to connectivity modulations between the STP and IPL modules. While the results are  generally in line with the primate model, they highlight the important role of human  IPL during the processing of both task-irrelevant and task-relevant auditory  information. Importantly, the present study shows that fMRI connectivity at rest,  during presentation of sounds, and during active listening provides novel  information about the functional organization of human AC.","2018-06","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","2113-2127","","5","223","","Brain Struct Funct","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 29376200","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\I6B8B6PV\Häkkinen and Rinne - 2018 - Intrinsic, stimulus-driven and task-dependent conn.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; fMRI; *Brain Mapping; Oxygen/blood; Psychomotor Performance/physiology; Functional connectivity; Acoustic Stimulation; Attention; Attention/*physiology; Auditory cortex; Auditory Cortex/diagnostic imaging/*physiology; Discrimination, Psychological/*physiology; Functional Laterality/physiology; Human; Neural Pathways/diagnostic imaging/*physiology; Pitch Perception; Reaction Time/physiology; Visual Perception/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even though  neurobiological bases of BD have still to be further elucidated, recent neuroimaging  studies provided compelling evidence about functional correlates of cognitive  deficits in BD patients, with working memory (WM) impairment being one of the most  commonly reported findings. Such dysfunctions are likely to persist beyond acute  phases of the illness, so they qualify as endophenotypic markers for the disorder.  This review sought to synthesize, through a MEDLINE search up to December 2012,  published functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies on WM networks,  conducted through N-back task in euthymic BD I patients and including a control  comparison group. Eight studies meeting the search criteria were identified. Despite  heterogeneity across findings, particularly in relation to task performance (i.e.  accuracy and reaction time), most studies reported a loss of connectivity in BD  patients' prefrontal networks, traditionally involved in WM, as well as patterns of  abnormal activation in the dorso/ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, other prefrontal  areas and the parietal and temporal cortex. These findings suggest the involvement  of intact secondary systems in order to overcome lack of integrity across WM  circuits in BD patients. Further investigation in the field is warranted.","2013","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","63-70","","2","68","","Neuropsychobiology","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 S.

However to date, the bulk of neuroimaging literature has  focused largely on the maintenance aspect of visuo-spatial WM, with a scarcity of  research into the aspects of WM involving manipulation of information. Thus, this  study aimed to compare maintenance-only with maintenance and manipulation of  visuo-spatial stimuli (3D cube shapes) utilizing a 1-back task while functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were acquired. Sixteen healthy participants  (9 women, M = 23.94 years, SD = 2.49) were required to perform the 1-back task with  or without mentally rotating the shapes 90° on a vertical axis. When no rotation was  required (maintenance-only condition), a right hemispheric lateralization was  revealed across fronto-parietal areas. However, when the task involved maintaining  and manipulating the same stimuli through 90° rotation, activation was primarily  seen in the bilateral parietal lobe and left fusiform gyrus. The findings confirm  that the well-established right lateralized fronto-parietal networks are likely to  underlie simple maintenance of visuo-spatial stimuli. The results also suggest that  the added demand of manipulation of information maintained online appears to require  further neural recruitment of functionally related areas. In particular mental  rotation of visuospatial stimuli required bilateral parietal areas, and the left  fusiform gyrus potentially to maintain a categorical or object representation. It  can be concluded that WM is a complex neural process involving the interaction of an  increasingly large network.","2016","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","87","","","10","","Front Behav Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 27199694  PMCID: PMC4858518","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\3ZZ27YWZ\Lamp et al. - 2016 - Mapping of the Underlying Neural Mechanisms of Mai.pdf","","fMRI; working memory; n-back; maintenance; manipulation; mental rotation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current  study uses multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to decode whether, on each trial of a  cognitive task, participants are in an optimal or suboptimal attentional state.  During fMRI, participants performed n-back tasks, composed of central face images  overlaid on distractor scenes, with low, perceptual, and working memory load.  Instructions were to respond to novel faces and withhold response to rare repeats.  To index attentional state, reaction time variability was calculated at each correct  response. Participants' 50% least variable trials were labeled optimal, or ""in the  zone,"" and their 50% most erratic trials were labeled suboptimal, or ""out of the  zone."" Support vector machine classifiers trained on activity in the default mode  network (DMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), and task-relevant fusiform face area  (FFA) distinguished in-the-zone and out-of-the-zone trials in all tasks. Consistent  with evidence that distractors are processed when central task load is low,  parahippocampal place area (PPA) classifiers were only successful in the low load  task. Classification in anatomical regions across the brain revealed widespread  coding of attentional state. In contrast to these robust pattern analyses,  univariate signal in DMN, DAN, FFA, and PPA did not distinguish states, suggesting a  nuanced relationship to sustained attention. In sum, MVPA can be used to decode  trial-by-trial attentional state throughout much of cortex, helping to characterize  how attention network fluctuations correlate with performance variability.","2015-07-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","249-256","","","114","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We recruited and genotyped adult patients with combined type ADHD and  healthy controls to achieve a sample balanced for age, sex, premorbid IQ, and three  ADGRL3 haplotype groups (risk, protective, and others). The final sample (n = 128)  underwent structural and functional brain imaging (voxel-based morphometry and  n-back working memory fMRI). We analyzed the brain structural and functional effects  of ADHD, haplotypes, and their interaction, covarying for age, sex, and medication.  Individuals (patients or controls) with the protective haplotype showed strong,  widespread hypo-activation in the frontal cortex extending to inferior temporal and  fusiform gyri. Individuals (patients or controls) with the risk haplotype also  showed hypo-activation, more focused in the right temporal cortex. Patients showed  parietal hyper-activation. Disorder-haplotype interactions, as well as structural  findings, were not statistically significant. To sum up, both protective and risk  ADGRL3 haplotypes are associated with substantial brain hypo-activation during  working memory tasks, stressing this gene's relevance in cognitive brain function.  Conversely, we did not find brain effects of the interactions between adult ADHD and  ADGRL3 haplotypes.","2021-01-27","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","2373","","1","11","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 33504901  PMCID: PMC7840726","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\KND7242B\Moreno-Alcázar et al. - 2021 - Brain structural and functional substrates of ADGR.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genotype; Adult; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Case-Control Studies; Functional Neuroimaging; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*diagnosis/*genetics; Brain/*metabolism/*physiopathology; Genetic Association Studies; Haplotypes; Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/*genetics; Receptors, Peptide/*genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While this proposal has received support  in neuropsychological studies, it has been relatively little tested using functional  imaging. This study aimed to examine brain activations associated with FTD, and its  two main factor-analytically derived subsyndromes, during the performance of a  working memory task. METHODS: Seventy patients with schizophrenia showing a full  range of FTD scores and 70 matched healthy controls underwent fMRI during the  performance of the 2-back version of the n-back task. Whole-brain corrected,  voxel-based correlations with FTD scores were examined in the patient group.  RESULTS: During 2-back performance the patients showed clusters of significant  inverse correlation with FTD scores in the inferior frontal cortex and dorsolateral  prefrontal cortex bilaterally, the left temporal cortex and subcortically in the  basal ganglia and thalamus. Further analysis revealed that these correlations  reflected an association only with 'alogia' (poverty of speech, poverty of content  of speech and perseveration) and not with the 'fluent disorganization' component of  FTD. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides functional imaging support for the view that  FTD in schizophrenia may involve impaired executive/frontal function. However, the  relationship appears to be exclusively with alogia and not with the variables  contributing to fluent disorganization.","2021-10","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","2446-2453","","14","51","","Psychol Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 32338241","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\8CIHM4HE\Fuentes-Claramonte et al. - 2021 - Brain functional correlates of formal thought diso.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; *fMRI; Executive Function/*physiology; *Executive function; *formal thought disorder; *n-back task; *schizophrenia; *speech disorder; Aphasia/*pathology; Basal Ganglia/pathology; Brain/*pathology; Cognitive Dysfunction; Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex/pathology; Frontal Lobe/pathology; Poverty; Schizophrenia/*pathology; Temporal Lobe/pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this thalamocortical imbalance  has not been studied during task engagement to date, limiting our understanding of  its role in cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. METHODS: Both n-back working  memory (WM) task-fMRI and resting-state fMRI data were collected from 172 patients  with SCZ and 103 healthy control subjects (HC). A replication sample with 49 SCZ and  48 HC was independently obtained. Sixteen thalamic subdivisions were employed as  seeds for the analysis. RESULTS: During both task-performance and rest, SCZ showed  thalamic hyperconnectivity with sensorimotor cortices, but hypoconnectivity with  prefrontal-cerebellar regions relative to controls. Higher sensorimotor-thalamic  connectivity and lower prefronto-thalamic connectivity both relate to poorer WM  performance (lower task accuracy and longer response time) and difficulties in  discriminating target from nontarget (lower d' score) in n-back task. The  prefronto-thalamic hypoconnectivity and sensorimotor-thalamic hyperconnectivity were  anti-correlated both in SCZ and HCs; this anti-correlation was more pronounced with  less cognitive demand (rest>0-back>2-back). These findings replicated well in the  second sample. Finally, the hypo- and hyper-connectivity patterns during  resting-state positively correlated with the hypo- and hyper-connectivity during  2-back task-state in SCZ respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The thalamocortical imbalance  reflected by prefronto-thalamic hypoconnectivity and sensorimotor-thalamic  hyperconnectivity is present both at rest and during task engagement in SCZ and  relates to working memory performance. The frontal reduction, sensorimotor  enhancement pattern of thalamocortical imbalance is a state-invariant feature of SCZ  that affects a core cognitive function.","2022-01-21","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","251-261","","1","48","","Schizophr Bull","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2021.

Research shows that MHE patients  have impairments in cognition affecting their daily lives that should be treated.  This study explored the neural basis of spatial working memory impairment in MHE  patients using behavioral test and BOLD-fMRI. Twelve normal controls, twelve  cirrhosis patients without MHE and twelve MHE patients took part. The memory  quotient of the MHE group (Wechsler Memory Scale-Chinese revised: WMS-CR) was lower  than the normal control group and the cirrhosis-without-MHE group, and primarily  concerned short-term memory and transient memory. Performance accuracy was lower for  the MHE group than the control group and the cirrhosis-without-MHE group, and mean  reaction time was prolonged. The fMRI data highlighted a neural network consisting  of: bilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), bilateral premotor area (PreMA),  supplementary motor area (SMA) and bilateral parietal areas (PA), which was  activated in the n-back task. The load effect of BOLD-fMRI response appeared in all  regions of interest (ROI) for the normal control group, but only appeared in PreMA  and PA, and did not vary with n-back load in PFC or SMA for the MHE group.  Activation intensities for all ROIs were higher for the normal control group than  the MHE group, especially in 2-back load. In conclusion, these results demonstrate  that MHE patients have debilitated spatial working memory, and that impairments of  bilateral PFC, PMA, SMA, and PA commonly lead to spatial working memory dysfunction.  Furthermore, PFC impairment may form the neural basis of spatial working memory  impairment.","2012-03-22","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","62-72","","","1445","","Brain Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Although  motor symptoms may be the most prominent presentation, cognitive symptoms such as  memory deficits and executive dysfunction typically co-occur. We used functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and task fMRI-based dynamic causal modeling (DCM)  to evaluate HD-related changes in the neural network underlying working memory (WM).  Sixty-four pre-symptomatic HD mutation carriers (preHD), 20 patients with early  manifest HD symptoms (earlyHD), and 83 healthy control subjects performed an n-back  fMRI task with two levels of WM load. Effective connectivity was assessed in five  predefined regions of interest, comprising bilateral inferior parietal cortex, left  anterior cingulate cortex, and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. HD mutation  carriers performed less accurately and more slowly at high WM load compared with the  control group. While between-group comparisons of brain activation did not reveal  differential recruitment of the cortical WM network in mutation carriers,  comparisons of brain connectivity as identified with DCM revealed a number of group  differences across the whole WM network. Most strikingly, we observed decreasing  connectivity from several regions toward right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  (rDLPFC) in preHD and even more so in earlyHD. The deterioration in rDLPFC  connectivity complements results from previous studies and might mirror beginning  cortical neural decline at premanifest and early manifest stages of HD. We were able  to characterize effective connectivity in a WM network of HD mutation carriers  yielding further insight into patterns of cognitive decline and accompanying neural  deterioration.","2018","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","370","","","9","","Front Neurol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 29915555  PMCID: PMC5994408","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\UXMIWPV7\Lahr et al. - 2018 - Working Memory-Related Effective Connectivity in H.pdf","","working memory; n-back; cluster analysis; dynamic causal modelling; effective connectivity; functional magnetic resonance; Huntington’s disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aerobic fitness is associated with cognitive  benefits in typically developing children and physical exercise promotes recovery  following brain injury. Accordingly, we investigated cognitive and neural correlates  of aerobic fitness in a sample of craniopharyngioma patients. METHODS: Patients  treated for craniopharyngioma [N=104, 10.0±4.6 years, 48% male] participated in  fitness, cognitive and fMRI (n=51) assessments following surgery but before proton  radiation therapy. RESULTS: Patients demonstrated impaired aerobic fitness [peak  oxygen uptake (PKVO2)=23.9±7.1, 41% impaired (i.e., 1.5 SD&lt;normative mean)],  motor proficiency [Bruininks-Oseretsky (BOT2)=38.6±9.0, 28% impaired], and executive  functions (e.g., WISC-IV Working Memory Index (WMI)=96.0±15.3, 11% impaired). PKVO2  correlated with better executive functions (e.g., WISC-IV WMI r=.27, p=.02) and  academic performance (WJ-III Calculation r=.24, p=.04). BOT2 correlated with better  attention (e.g., CPT-II omissions r=.26, p=.04) and executive functions (e.g.,  WISC-IV WMI r=.32, p=.01).

CONCLUSIONS: Before adjuvant therapy, children with craniopharyngioma demonstrate  significantly reduced aerobic fitness, motor proficiency, and working memory. Better  aerobic fitness and motor proficiency are associated with better attention and  executive functions, as well as greater activation of a well-established working  memory network.

The  immediate memory task/delayed memory task (IMT/DMT) detects varying degrees of  working memory (WM) by alternating three levels of complexity and two levels of WM  delay. This paradigm has not been evaluated in MS nor validated against standard  neuropsychological (NP) testing. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the correlation between WM  function and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activation on fMRI in MS patients  undergoing the IMT/DMT. To compare IMT/DMT behavioral scores to NP scores. METHODS:  10 MS patients with no history of CI underwent the Minimal Assessment of Cognitive  Function in MS (MACFIMS) and an fMRI session where they performed the IMT/DMT.  Working-memory (""wmem"") activation was defined as the BOLD signal during DMT blocks  for a particular condition (3, 5, or 7 digits per stimuli) minus the BOLD signal  during IMT blocks for that condition. Areas of statistically significant Family Wise  Error (FWE) -corrected cluster-level BOLD activation were identified using SPM8  Random Effects t-test. IMT/DMT behavioral data and MACFIMS scores were compared.  RESULTS: The 3-digit as well as the 5-digit wmem showed significant fMRI BOLD  activation. The 3-digit wmem, activation was found in portions of the bilateral  superior and mid frontal cortex, supplementary motor area, pre and post central  gyrus, bilateral superior and inferior parietal lobule, inferolateral pre-frontal  cortex, cuneus, insula and cingulate regions. The 5 digit wmen activation was seen  in the inferior medial frontal and medial orbitofrontal cortex. IMT/DMT behavioral  scores were within normal range and consistent with MACFIMS. CONCLUSION: IMT/DMT, a  novel fMRI working memory paradigm, is associated with BOLD activation in areas of  the brain related to cognitive function in patients with MS. Both MACFIMS and  IMT/DMT scores were in agreement and supported intact cognitive function.","2013-09","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1011","","2","1","","J Neurol Disord Stroke","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 24772453  PMCID: PMC3996842","","","","Working memory; Cognitive impairment; Functional MRI; Multiple sclerosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Insight concerning the neurocircuitry of  cognitive improvement could provide a biomarker for pro-cognitive effects to advance  treatment development. The dorsal prefrontal cortex (dPFC) is a promising region for  such treatment target engagement. The aim of this functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI) study was to examine the effects of action-based cognitive  remediation (ABCR) on early change in the dPFC blood-oxygen-level-dependent response  in patients with BD in remission, and whether the observed neural change predicted  improved executive functions following 10 weeks of treatment. Forty-five  participants with remitted BD (ABCR: n = 26, control treatment: n = 19) completed a  spatial n-back working memory task during fMRI and executive function tasks outside  the scanner before and after two weeks of ABCR/control treatment, and an additional  assessment of executive function at treatment completion. Thirty-four healthy  controls underwent a single fMRI and executive function assessment for baseline  comparisons. We found an early reversal of pretreatment hypo-activity in the  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) following ABCR vs. control during both  high-load (2-back > 1-back) working memory (WM) (F(1,43) = 5.69, p = 0.02,  η(2) = 0.12) and general WM (2-back > 0-back) (F(1,43) = 5.61, p = 0.02,  η(2) = 0.12). This dlPFC activity increase predicted improved executive functions at  treatment completion (high-load WM: B = -0.45, p = 0.01, general WM: B = -0.41,  p < 0.01), independent of changes in subsyndromal symptoms. In conclusion, early  dPFC increase may provide a neurocircuitry-based biomarker for pro-cognitive  effects. Future cognition trials should include fMRI assessments to confirm the  validity of this putative biomarker model across disorders with cognitive  impairment.","2021-05","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1113-1121","","6","46","","Neuropsychopharmacology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 33168945  PMCID: PMC8115100","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\UC4QY9BA\Ott et al. - 2021 - Change in prefrontal activity and executive functi.pdf","","Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Memory, Short-Term; Executive Function; Cognition; *Bipolar Disorder/diagnostic imaging/therapy; *Cognitive Remediation; Prefrontal Cortex/diagnostic imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To test this  hypothesis, we derived parcellation atlases from twenty-nine healthy adult  participants enrolled in the Cognitive Connectome project, an initiative to improve  functional MRI's translation into clinical decision-making by mapping normative  variance in brain-behavior relationships. Participants underwent resting-state and  task-based fMRI spanning nine cognitive domains: motor, visuospatial, attention,  language, memory, affective processing, decision-making, working memory, and  executive function. Spatially constrained n-cut parcellation derived brain atlases  using (1) all participants' functional data (Task) or (2) a single resting-state  scan (Rest). An atlas was also derived from random parcellation for comparison  purposes (Random). Two methods were compared: (1) a parcellation applied to the  group's mean edge weights (mean), and (2) a two-stage approach with parcellation of  individual edge weights followed by parcellation of mean binarized edges  (two-stage). The resulting Task and Rest atlases had significantly greater  similarity with each other (mean Jaccard indices JI=0.72-0.85) than with the Random  atlases (JI=0.59-0.63; all p<0.001 after Bonferroni correction). Task and Rest atlas  similarity was greatest for the two-stage method (JI=0.85), which has been shown as  more robust than the mean method; these atlases also better reproduced voxelwise  seed maps of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during rest and performing the  n-back working memory task (r=0.75-0.80) than the Random atlases (r=0.64-0.72),  further validating their utility. We expected regions governing higher-order  cognition (such as frontal and anterior temporal lobes) to show greatest difference  between Task and Rest atlases; contrary to expectations, these areas had greatest  similarity between atlases. Our findings indicate that atlases derived from  parcellation of task-based and resting-state fMRI data are highly comparable, and  existing resting-state atlases are suitable for task-based analyses. We introduce an  anatomically labeled fMRI-derived whole-brain human atlas for future Cognitive  Connectome analyses.","2016-02","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","209-218","","2","34","","Magn Reson Imaging","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Correlations between fMRI abnormalities and clinico-behavioural  and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures were assessed. RESULTS:  Participants activated brain regions of the working memory network, especially in  fronto-parietal lobes and cerebellum, and deactivated areas of the default mode  network (DMN). During the N-back load contrast, compared to HC, the three groups of  MS patients had a common pattern of decreased activation of the right superior  parietal lobule, left inferior parietal lobule and left middle frontal gyrus. Areas  specifically more active in CIS patients compared to the other study groups were  found in the left medial superior frontal gyrus and right anterior cingulate cortex,  whereas SPMS patients selectively activated the left parahippocampal gyrus and left  superior temporal pole (STP). Worse accuracy and global cognitive scores correlated  with increased STP activation. CONCLUSION: Load-dependent alterations of working  memory network recruitment occur in MS. Frontal hyperactivation is maintained in CIS  and lost in SPMS. Abnormal recruitment of DMN areas is related to worse cognitive  and behavioural outcomes.","2017-04","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","577-587","","4","23","","Mult Scler","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 27354020","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\PIVRLTG7\Vacchi et al. - 2017 - Working memory network dysfunction in relapse-onse.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Phenotype; Adolescent; Adult; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; fMRI; *Brain Mapping; Multiple sclerosis; attentive-executive domain; Brain/*pathology/physiopathology; Cerebellum/pathology; clinical phenotypes; default mode network; Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting/*pathology; N-back; Nerve Net/*pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This effect may depend on variability in stress reactivity  and past subjective stress. However, as most studies employed between-subjects  designs, evidence for within-subject stress effects remains scarce. To understand  the role of intra-individual stress effects on WM, we adopted a within-subject  design to study how acute stress, variability in stress reactivity, and past  subjective stress influence behavioral and neural WM mechanisms. Thirty-four healthy  males performed a WM task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a  control versus acute stress condition following the Trier Social Stress Test, a  validated psychosocial stressor method. We tested for stress effects on WM  performance and related neural activation by associating them with individual acute  stress responsivity and past subjective stress experience using retrospective  self-report questionnaires. We found no evidence of an effect of acute stress or  related stress-reactivity on intra-individual WM performance. However, past  subjective stress negatively influenced acute stress-induced changes to WM. On the  neural level, acute stress reduced WM-related activation in the dorsolateral  prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). The observed negative influence of inter-individual  variability in past subjective stress experience on changes in WM performance,  suggests that past subjective stress might induce vulnerability for impairing  effects of acute stress on cognitive functioning. Because acute stress reduced  WM-related dlPFC activation while WM performance remained unaffected, acute stress  might boost neural processing efficiency in this group of high performing healthy  individuals. Our study suggests that measures of past subjective stress should be  considered when studying and interpreting the effects of acute stress on cognition.","2018-10","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","25-34","","","96","","Psychoneuroendocrinology","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This preliminary study examined  fMRI data from a clinical trial implementing a 4-week virtual reality driving  intervention to assess how sustained training can improve deficits related to  traumatic brain injury. Previously-reported behavioral findings showed improvements  in working memory and processing speed in those who received the intervention; this  report explores the brain bases of these effects by comparing neural activity  related to working memory (n-back task) and resting state connectivity before and  after the intervention. In the baseline visit (n = 24), working memory activity was  prominent in bilateral DLPFC and prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, medial superior  frontal gyrus, left thalamus, bilateral supramarginal / angular gyrus, precuneus,  and left posterior middle temporal gyrus. Following intervention, participants  showed less global activation on the n-back task, with regions of activity only in  the bilateral middle frontal cortex, posterior middle frontal gyrus, and  supramarginal gyrus. Activity related to working memory load was reduced for the  group that went through the intervention (n = 7) compared to the waitlist control  group (n = 4). These results suggest that successful cognitive rehabilitation of  working memory in TBI may be associated with increased efficiency of brain networks,  evidenced by reduced activation of brain activity during cognitive processing. These  results highlight the importance of examining brain activity related to cognitive  rehabilitation of attention and working memory after brain injury.","2021-02","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","410-420","","1","15","","Brain Imaging Behav","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 32328915","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\C5YFYSXI\Gimbel et al. - 2021 - Brain bases of recovery following cognitive rehabi.pdf","","Humans; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; fMRI; n-back; Brain/diagnostic imaging; Memory, Short-Term; Cognition; *Brain Injuries, Traumatic/diagnostic imaging; Intervention; Rehabilitation; Traumatic brain injury","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Until  recently, there are few studies on generative models supporting classification and  prediction of neural systems compared to the description of the architecture.  However, the requirement of collapsing data spatially and temporally in the  state-of-the art methods to analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),  electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data cause loss of  important information. In this study, we addressed this issue using a topological  data analysis (TDA) method, called Mapper, which visualizes evolving patterns of  brain activity as a mathematical graph. Accordingly, we analyzed preprocessed MEG  data of 83 subjects from Human Connectome Project (HCP) collected during working  memory n-back task. We examined variation in the dynamics of the brain states with  the Mapper graphs, and to determine how this variation relates to measures such as  response time and performance. The application of the Mapper method to MEG data  detected a novel neuroimaging marker that explained the performance of the  participants along with the ground truth of response time. In addition, TDA enabled  us to distinguish two task-positive brain activations during 0-back and 2-back  tasks, which is hard to detect with the other pipelines that require collapsing the  data in the spatial and temporal domain. Further, the Mapper graphs of the  individuals also revealed one large group in the middle of the stimulus detecting  the high engagement in the brain with fine temporal resolution, which could  contribute to increase spatiotemporal resolution by merging different imaging  modalities. Hence, our work provides another evidence to the effectiveness of the  TDA methods for extracting subtle dynamic properties of high temporal resolution MEG  data without the temporal and spatial collapse.","2019-06-19","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","","","6","9","","Brain Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31248185  PMCID: PMC6628086","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\F4ZCW6E8\Duman et al. - 2019 - Uncovering Dynamic Brain Reconfiguration in MEG Wo.pdf","","working memory; dynamic functional connectivity; mapper; MEG; topological data analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Only three studies have compared brain activation during the n-back  when using auditory and visual stimuli. The earliest study, a positron emission  tomography study of the 3-back, found no differences in VWM-related brain activation  between n-back modalities. In contrast, two subsequent functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI) studies of the 2-back found that auditory VWM was associated with  greater left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DL-PFC) activation than visual VWM,  perhaps suggesting that auditory VWM requires more cognitive effort than its visual  counterpart. The current study aimed to assess whether DL-PFC activation (i.e.,  cognitive effort) differs by VWM modality. To do this, 16 younger adults completed  an auditory and visual n-back, both at four levels of VWM load. Concurrently,  activation of the PFC was measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy  (fNIRS), a silent neuroimaging method. We found that DL-PFC activation increased  with VWM load, but it was not affected by VWM modality or the interaction between  load and modality. This supports the view that both VWM modalities require similar  cognitive effort, and perhaps that previous fMRI results were an artefact of scanner  noise. We also found that, across conditions, DL-PFC activation was positively  correlated with reaction time. This may further support DL-PFC activation as an  index of cognitive effort, and fNIRS as a method to measure it.","2021-03-26","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","113102","","","402","","Behav Brain Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Episodic memory is vital because it enables individuals to form and maintain their  self-identities. Our study analyzes the extent to which whole-brain functional  connectivity observed during completion of an N-back memory task, a common measure  of working memory, can predict both working memory and episodic memory. METHODS: We  used connectome-based predictive models (CPMs) to predict 502 Human Connectome  Project (HCP) participants' in-scanner 2-back memory test scores and out-of-scanner  working memory test (List Sorting) and episodic memory test (Picture Sequence and  Penn Word) scores based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data  collected both during rest and N-back task performance. We also analyzed the  functional brain connections that contributed to prediction for each of these  models. RESULTS: Functional connectivity observed during N-back task performance  predicted out-of-scanner List Sorting scores and to a lesser extent out-of-scanner  Picture Sequence scores, but did not predict out-of-scanner Penn Word scores.  Additionally, the functional connections predicting 2-back scores overlapped to a  greater degree with those predicting List Sorting scores than with those predicting  Picture Sequence or Penn Word scores. Functional connections with the insula,  including connections between insular and parietal regions, predicted scores across  the 2-back, List Sorting, and Picture Sequence tasks. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings  validate functional connectivity observed during the N-back task as a measure of  working memory, which generalizes to predict episodic memory to a lesser extent. By  building on our understanding of the predictive power of N-back task functional  connectivity, this work enhances our knowledge of relationships between working  memory and episodic memory.","2021-08","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","e02105","","8","11","","Brain Behav","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 The Authors.

We studied the association of emotional blunting, rumination with neural networks  dynamics in remitted depressed patients and cognitive performance during an N-Back  task. Twenty-six outpatients in remission of depression (Hamilton Depressive rating  scale score <7) performed an N-Back task during fMRI assessment. All patients had  been treated by paroxetine for a minimum of 4 months. Two subgroups of patients  [Nonemotionally blunted (NEB) = 14 and emotionally blunted (EB) = 12] were  determined. To identify functional network maps across participants, the Network  Detection using Independent Component Analysis approach was employed. Within and  between Task Positive Network (TPN) and Default Mode Network (DMN) connectivity were  assessed and related to variability of performance on the N-Back task and  rumination. EB and NEB patients were not different for the level of accurate  responses at the N-Back. However over the entire working memory task, the negative  correlation between DMN and TPN was significantly lower in the EB than NEB group and  was differently related to cognitive performance and rumination. The stronger the  negative correlation between DMN and TPN was, the less variable the reaction time  during 3-Back task in NEB patients. Moreover the greater the negative correlation  between DMN and TPN was, the lower the rumination score in EB patients. Emotional  blunting may be associated with compromised monitoring of rumination and cognitive  functioning in remitted depressed patients through altered cooperation between DMN  and TPN. The study suggests clinical remission in depression is associated with  biological heterogeneity.

The three groups were  preselected to match on age, education and predicted IQ, and the two patient groups  to have distinct insight levels. Performance and fMRI data were analysed to  determine how groups of patients with preserved and poor insight differed from each  other, and from healthy participants. RESULTS: Poor insight patients showed lower  performance accuracy, relative to healthy participants (p=0.01) and preserved  insight patients (p=0.08); the two patient groups were comparable on symptoms and  medication. Preserved insight patients, relative to poor insight patients, showed  greater activity most consistently in the precuneus and cerebellum (both bilateral)  during WM; they also showed greater activity than healthy participants in the  inferior-superior frontal gyrus and cerebellum (bilateral). Group differences in  brain activity did not co-vary significantly with performance accuracy. CONCLUSIONS:  The precuneus and cerebellum function contribute to preserved insight in  schizophrenia. Preserved insight as well as normal-range WM capacity in  schizophrenia sub-groups may be achieved via compensatory neural activity in the  frontal cortex and cerebellum.","2014-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","201-209","","1","152","","Schizophr Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The work of Don Stuss and others  has demonstrated that frontal and parietal cortices are crucial to cognitive  control, particularly in normal aging, which is characterized by reduced control  mechanisms. However, the structure-function relationships specific to each domain  and subsequent impact on performance are not well understood. In the current study,  we examined both age and individual differences in functional activity associated  with core domains of cognitive control in relation to fronto-parietal structure and  task performance. Participants (n = 140, aged 20-86 years) completed three fMRI  tasks: go/no-go (inhibition), task switching (shifting), and n-back (working  memory), in addition to structural and diffusion imaging. All three tasks engaged a  common set of fronto-parietal regions; however, the contributions of age, brain  structure, and task performance to functional activity were unique to each domain.  Aging was associated with differences in functional activity for all tasks, largely  in regions outside common fronto-parietal control regions. Shifting and inhibition  showed greater contributions of structure to overall decreases in brain activity,  suggesting that more intact fronto-parietal structure may serve as a scaffold for  efficient functional response. Working memory showed no contribution of structure to  functional activity but had strong effects of age and task performance. Together,  these results provide a comprehensive and novel examination of the joint  contributions of aging, performance, and brain structure to functional activity  across multiple domains of cognitive control.","2021-08-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1811-1832","","9","33","","J Cogn Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 34375414","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\532B92P3\Rieck et al. - 2021 - Contributions of Brain Function and Structure to T.pdf","","Humans; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Reaction Time; Brain/diagnostic imaging; *Memory, Short-Term; *Aging; Cognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DLPFC dysfunction is related to  cognitive impairment. It has been suggested that dietary components and high-density  lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) play a vital role in brain health and cognitive  function. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the relationships between dietary  nutrient intake and lipid levels with functional MRI (fMRI) brain activation in  DLPFC among older adults with mild cognitive impairment. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A  total of 15 community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment, aged ≥60  years, participated in this cross-sectional study at selected senior citizen clubs  in Klang Valley, Malaysia. The 7-day recall Diet History Questionnaire was used to  assess participants' dietary nutrient intake. Fasting blood samples were also  collected for lipid profile assessment. All participants performed N-back (0- and  1-back) working memory tasks during fMRI scanning. DLPFC (Brodmann's areas 9 and 46,  and inferior, middle, and superior frontal gyrus) was identified as a region of  interest for analysis. RESULTS: Positive associations were observed between dietary  intake of energy, protein, cholesterol, vitamins B6 and B12, potassium, iron,  phosphorus, magnesium, and HDL-C with DLPFC activation (P<0.05). Multivariate  analysis showed that vitamin B6 intake, β=0.505, t (14)=3.29, P=0.023, and Digit  Symbol score, β=0.413, t (14)=2.89, P=0.045; R (2)=0.748, were positively related to  DLPFC activation. CONCLUSION: Increased vitamin B6 intake and cognitive processing  speed were related to greater activation in the DLPFC region, which was responsible  for working memory, executive function, attention, planning, and decision making.

Although hippocampus activity is  believed to be affected by socioeconomic status (SES), limited knowledge exists on  which SES indicators influence hippocampus function. Purpose: This study explored  the separate and combined effects of three SES indicators, namely parental  education, family income, and neighborhood income, on adolescents' hippocampus  activation during an N-Back memory task. As some of the effects of parental  education may be through income, we also tested if the effect of parental education  on hippocampus activation during our N-Back memory task is mediated by family or  neighborhood income. Methods: The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)  study is a national multi-center investigation of American adolescents' brain  development. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of a total sample of  3067 9-10-year-old adolescents were used. The primary outcome was left- hippocampus  activation during the N-Back memory task (mean beta weight for N-Back run 1 2 back  versus 0 back contrast in left hippocampus). The independent variable was parental  education. Family income and neighborhood income were two possible mediators. Age,  sex, and marital status were the covariates. To test mediation, we used hierarchical  linear regression models first without and then with our mediators. Full mediation  was defined according to Kenny. The Sobel test was used to confirm statistical  mediation. Results: In the absence of family and neighborhood income in the model,  higher parental educational attainment was associated with lower level of left  hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory task. This effect was significant  while age, sex, and marital status were controlled. The association between parental  educational attainment and hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory task was  no more significant when we controlled for family and neighborhood income. Instead,  family income was associated with hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory  task. These findings suggested that family income fully mediates the effect of  parental educational attainment on left hippocampus activation during the N-Back  memory task. Conclusions: The effect of parental educational attainment on  adolescents' hippocampus activation during an N-Back memory task is fully explained  by family income. That means low family income is why adolescents with low-educated  parents show highlighted hippocampus activation during an N-Back memory task. Given  the central role of the hippocampus in learning and memory and as income is a  modifiable factor by tax and economic policies, income-redistribution policies, fair  taxation, and higher minimum wage may have implications for promotion of adolescent  equality and social justice. There is a need to focus on family-level economic needs  across all levels of neighborhood income.","2020-08-05","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","","","8","10","","Brain Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 32764344  PMCID: PMC7464386","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\J9F3VL97\Assari et al. - 2020 - Family Income Mediates the Effect of Parental Educ.pdf","","adolescents; brain development; fMRI; socioeconomic factors; hippocampus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Working memory is often  affected, along with attention, executive control, and cognitive processing speed.  Verbal working memory (VWM) requires the interaction of each of the cognitive  component processes along with a phonological loop for verbal repetition and  rehearsal. HIV-related functional brain response abnormalities during VWM are  evident in functional MRI (fMRI), though the neural substrate underlying these  neurocognitive deficits is not well understood. The current study addressed this by  comparing 24 HIV+ to 27 demographically matched HIV-seronegative (HIV-) adults with  respect to fMRI activation on a VWM paradigm (n-back) relative to performance on two  standardized tests of executive control, attention and processing speed (Stroop and  Trail Making A-B). As expected, the HIV+ group had deficits on these neurocognitive  tests compared to HIV- controls, and also differed in neural response on fMRI  relative to neuropsychological performance. Reduced activation in VWM task-related  brain regions on the 2-back was associated with Stroop interference deficits in HIV+  but not with either Trail Making A or B performance. Activation of the posterior  cingulate cortex (PCC) of the default mode network during rest was associated with  Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-2 (HVLT-2) learning in HIV+. These effects were not  observed in the HIV- controls. Reduced dynamic range of neural response was also  evident in HIV+ adults when activation on the 2-back condition was compared to the  extent of activation of the default mode network during periods of rest. Neural  dynamic range was associated with both Stroop and HVLT-2 performance. These findings  provide evidence that HIV-associated alterations in neural activation induced by VWM  demands and during rest differentially predict executive-attention and verbal  learning deficits. That the Stroop, but not Trail Making was associated with VWM  activation suggests that attentional regulation difficulties in suppressing  interference and/or conflict regulation are a component of working memory deficits  in HIV+ adults. Alterations in neural dynamic range may be a useful index of the  impact of HIV on functional brain response and as a fMRI metric in predicting  cognitive outcomes.","2018-06","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","291-304","","3","24","","J Neurovirol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 29280107  PMCID: PMC6022366","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\HNRCPLJQ\Cohen et al. - 2018 - Neural response to working memory demand predicts .pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Gyrus Cinguli/physiopathology; *Working memory; *Memory, Short-Term; *Cognition; Case-Control Studies; Attention; *Stroop; *Attention; *Executive control; *Executive Function; *Functional MRI; *HIV; *Verbal Learning; Cognitive Dysfunction/complications/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology; HIV Infections/complications/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Rest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the neural mechanism  underlying DMN deactivation remains elusive. As the coordination of regional  neurochemical substrates and interregional neural interactions are both essential in  support of brain functions, a quantitative description of how they impact DMN  deactivation may provide new insights into the mechanism. Using an n-back working  memory task fMRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we probed the pairwise  relationship between task-induced deactivation, interregional functional  connectivity and regional excitation-inhibition balance (evaluated by glutamate/GABA  ratio) in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCu). Task-induced PCC/PCu  deactivation correlated with its excitation-inhibition balance and interregional  functional connectivity, where participants with lower glutamate/GABA ratio,  stronger intra-DMN connections and stronger antagonistic DMN-SN (salience  network)/ECN (executive control network) inter-network connections had greater  PCC/PCu deactivation. Mediation analyses revealed that the DMN-SN functional  interactions partially mediated the relationship between task-induced deactivation  and the excitation-inhibition balance at the PCC/PCu. The triple-relationship  discovered in the present study has the potential to bridge DMN-deactivation related  findings from various neuroimaging modalities and may provide new insights into the  neural mechanism of DMN deactivation. Moreover, this finding may have significant  implications for neuropsychiatric disorders related to the DMN dysfunction and  suggests an integrated application of pharmacological and neuromodulation-based  strategies for rescuing DMN deactivation deficits.","2019-01-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","388-397","","","185","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Published by Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","PMID: 30359729  PMCID: PMC8284909","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\QDZF4KLG\Gu et al. - 2019 - Regional excitation-inhibition balance predicts de.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain Mapping/*methods; Brain/*physiology; *fMRI; Memory, Short-Term/physiology; *Default mode network; *Functional connectivity; Nerve Net/*physiology; *Magnetic resonance spectroscopy; *Task-based deactivation; Executive Function/physiology; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies show altered brain  activity during performance of working memory (WM) tasks in both individuals with  schizophrenia and their first-degree relatives as compared to healthy controls (HC).  This study examined whether similar changes are already present in pre-adolescent  children at familial high-risk (FHR) for psychosis. METHODS: 37 children (17 FHR, 20  HC) between 7 and 12 years old participated in this study. WM performance was  assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV (WISC-IV). To assess  brain activation during WM performance, participants completed a visual  block-designed n-back task with 2 conditions (2-back and 0-back) during scanning.  fMRI data was preprocessed and analyzed using FSL Feat. RESULTS: Compared to HC, FHR  children showed significantly lower WISC-IV WM scores. In addition, FHR children  exhibited hypoactivation in the 2-back (versus 0-back) condition in a cluster  encompassing bilateral precuneus and cuneus and right posterior cingulate cortex.  There were no significant group-differences in n-back task performance and brain  activation. The precuneus cluster was not correlated with n-back performance or WISC  WM scores. CONCLUSIONS: The current results provide preliminary evidence of impaired  WM function and altered brain activity during WM performance in children with a  familial predisposition for psychosis.

One type of childhood maltreatment that  remains stigmatized and under-researched among men is child sexual abuse (CSA).  Research examining the neurophysiological consequences of CSA in males is limited  even further. OBJECTIVE: To provide preliminary insight into the neural basis of the  impact of CSA during two working memory tasks. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Men with  CSA histories, with and without post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; CSA + PTSD  n = 7, mean age = 45; CSA-PTSD; n = 9, mean age = 41), and men without a CSA history  nor PTSD (n = 13, mean age = 36) participated in the study at a local hospital.  METHODS: Participants completed a letter n-back task and an emotional picture n-back  task during fMRI to measure working memory and the influence of emotion on working  memory. They also completed self-report measures to assess mental health and  childhood abuse histories. RESULTS: In the letter n-back task, men with CSA + PTSD  had less activation in the cerebellum and left fusiform gyrus compared to CSA-PTSD  men. During the working memory task with negative emotional pictures the control  group had greater frontal activation, while the CSA-PTSD group had greater limbic  activation. Analyses were performed with independent-samples t-tests. CONCLUSIONS:  This study provides preliminary empirical evidence of the impact CSA can have on men  regarding working memory when negative stimuli are involved. It highlights that CSA,  even without a diagnosis of PTSD, can have a significant neurophysiological impact.  It also provides clinicians with information to support well-being and help with  potential day to day challenges.","2021-12","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","105340","","","122","","Child Abuse Negl","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

However, the relationship between  loneliness and neural network functioning during executive cognitive processes, such  as working memory, in MDD is still unclear. To address this gap, our study recruited  21 medicated MDD patients (mean age = 52.0 ± 5 years) and 24 matched healthy  controls (HC) (mean age = 48.7 ± 6 years) who completed an n-back fMRI task. For  behavioural performance, we observed no significant moderating effect of MDD or  loneliness on the task condition effect. However, loneliness was positively  associated, and MDD was negatively associated, with the functional connectivity  between the inferior parietal cortex and the rostral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex  (DMPFC) during task performance. Furthermore, an interactive effect of loneliness  and MDD was observed on the functional connectivity between the supplementary motor  area and the caudal DMPFC during the n-back task, with loneliness showing a positive  relationship in the HC group but a negative relationship in the MDD group with the  connectivity. Our results indicated that loneliness may be associated with altered  neural regulatory functioning on self-referential processing and action control,  which may further depend on the individual's depressive state. These findings can  form the theoretical basis for devising intervention programme aimed at improving  the mental wellness of the healthy and depressed lonely individuals.","2020-09-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","112776","","","393","","Behav Brain Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020.

It remains unknown,  however, how the neural systems that support working memory are altered through  intensive training to enable the expansion of working memory capacity. We used fMRI  to measure plasticity in activations associated with complex working memory before  and after 20 days of training. Healthy young adults were randomly assigned to train  on either a dual n-back working memory task or a demanding visuospatial attention  task. Training resulted in substantial and task-specific expansion of dual n-back  abilities accompanied by changes in the relationship between working memory load and  activation. Training differentially affected activations in two large-scale  frontoparietal networks thought to underlie working memory: the executive control  network and the dorsal attention network. Activations in both networks linearly  scaled with working memory load before training, but training dissociated the role  of the two networks and eliminated this relationship in the executive control  network. Load-dependent functional connectivity both within and between these two  networks increased following training, and the magnitudes of increased connectivity  were positively correlated with improvements in task performance. These results  provide insight into the adaptive neural systems that underlie large gains in  working memory capacity through training.","2016-04","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","575-588","","4","28","","J Cogn Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 26741799  PMCID: PMC5724764","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\KP2QZ84N\Thompson et al. - 2016 - Intensive Working Memory Training Produces Functio.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; *Brain Mapping; Oxygen/blood; Reaction Time/physiology; Analysis of Variance; Frontal Lobe/diagnostic imaging/*physiology; Learning/*physiology; Linear Models; Nerve Net/diagnostic imaging/physiology; Neural Pathways/diagnostic imaging; Parietal Lobe/diagnostic imaging/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We found decreased behavioral performance with increasing load and decreasing visual  resolution, but the neurobiological mechanisms involved differed between the two  manipulations and did so for both groups. Importantly, while the load manipulation  was, as predicted, accompanied by activation in the frontoparietal working memory  network, the resolution manipulation resulted in temporal and occipital activation.  Furthermore, we found evidence of cross-modal reorganization in the secondary  auditory cortex: DES had stronger activation and stronger connectivity between this  and several other regions. We conclude that load and stimulus resolution have  different neural underpinnings in the visual-verbal domain, which has consequences  for current working memory models, and that for DES the secondary auditory cortex is  involved in the binding of representations when task demands are low.","2021-06-10","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","3165-3176","","7","31","","Cereb Cortex","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2021.

Despite widespread  use, the clinical utility of these tasks is not well specified. This study compared  N-back performance during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with task  data acquired outside of the scanner as a measure of reliability across environment.  N-back task validity was examined in relation to performance and rater-based  measures used clinically to assess working memory. METHOD: Forty-three healthy  adults completed verbal and object N-back tasks during fMRI scanning and outside the  scanner. Task difficulty was varied parametrically (0, 1, and 2-back conditions).  Order of N-back task completion was stratified by modality (verbal/object) and  environment. Participants completed the Digit Span (DS) and provided self-ratings  using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF-WM). RESULTS: Mean  verbal and object N-back accuracy was above 95% across load conditions; task  difficulty was effectively manipulated across load conditions. Performance accuracy  did not significantly differ by environment. N-back reaction time was slower during  fMRI (F = 6.52, p = .01, ηp(2) = .13); participants were faster when initially  completing tasks outside the scanner (ηp(2) = .10-.15). Verbal 2-back accuracy was  significantly related to DS performance (r = .36, p = .02). N-back performance was  not related to BRIEF-WM. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence for reliability  of N-back accuracy during fMRI scanning; however, reliability of reaction time data  is affected by order of task presentation. Data regarding construct validity are  inconsistent and emphasize the need to consider clinical utility of behavioral  measures in the design and interpretation of functional neuroimaging studies.","2014","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","875-886","","8","36","","J Clin Exp Neuropsychol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 25252868  PMCID: PMC4229404","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\TWB6FZXR\Jacola et al. - 2014 - Clinical utility of the N-back task in functional .pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Young Adult; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Oxygen/blood; Photic Stimulation; Working memory; Executive Function; Reaction Time/physiology; Analysis of Variance; Reproducibility of Results; N-back; *Neuropsychological Tests; Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function; Brain/*blood supply/physiology; Digit Span; Intelligence Tests; Psychometrics; Psychomotor Performance; Reliability; Validity; Verbal Learning/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Working-memory may therefore be a powerful predictor of the course of  drug use, but chronic substance use may also impair working-memory. The aim of this  3-year longitudinal neuro-imaging study was to investigate the relationship between  substance use (e.g. alcohol, cannabis, nicotine, illegal psychotropic drugs) and  working-memory network function over time in heavy cannabis users and controls.  Forty-nine participants performed an n-back working-memory task at baseline and at  3-year follow-up. At follow-up, there were 22 current heavy cannabis users, 4  abstinent heavy cannabis users and 23 non-cannabis-using controls.  Tensor-independent component analysis (Tensor-ICA) was used to investigate  individual differences in working-memory network functionality over time. Within the  group of cannabis users, cannabis-related problems remained stable, whereas  alcohol-related problems, nicotine dependence and illegal psychotropic substance use  increased over time. At both measurements, behavioral performance and network  functionality during the n-back task did not differ between heavy cannabis users and  controls. Although n-back accuracy improved, working-memory network function  remained stable over time. Within the group of cannabis users, working-memory  network functionality was not associated with substance use. These results suggest  that sustained moderate to heavy levels of cannabis, nicotine, alcohol and illegal  psychotropic substance use do not change working-memory network functionality.  Moreover, baseline network functionality did not predict cannabis use and related  problems three years later, warranting longitudinal studies in more chronic or  dependent cannabis users.","2014-03","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","282-293","","2","19","","Addict Biol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2013 Society for the Study of Addiction.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 24589297","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\RFCDUHIS\Cousijn et al. - 2014 - Relationship between working-memory network functi.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Young Adult; Risk Factors; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Brain/*physiopathology; fMRI; Brain Mapping/*methods; n-back; Case-Control Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Memory, Short-Term/drug effects/*physiology; Analysis of Variance; Linear Models; Age of Onset; Behavior, Addictive/epidemiology/physiopathology; Cannabis; cannabis use disorder; Disease Progression; Dronabinol/adverse effects; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/methods; Marijuana Abuse/epidemiology/*physiopathology; Memory Disorders/epidemiology/*physiopathology; Nerve Net/physiopathology; Neuropsychological Tests/statistics & numerical data; Psychotropic Drugs/adverse effects; Severity of Illness Index; Substance-Related Disorders/epidemiology/*physiopathology; working-memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have, however, mostly focused on  adult expert gamers and have not included measurements of both behavioral  performance and brain activity. In the current study, 167 adolescents and young  adults (aged 13-24 years) with different amounts of gaming experience performed an  n-back working memory task with vowels, with the sensory modality of the vowel  stream switching between audition and vision at random intervals. We studied the  relationship between self-reported daily gaming activity, working memory (n-back)  task performance and related brain activity measured using functional magnetic  resonance imaging (fMRI). The results revealed that the extent of daily gaming  activity was related to enhancements in both performance accuracy and speed during  the most demanding (2-back) level of the working memory task. This improved working  memory performance was accompanied by enhanced recruitment of a fronto-parietal  cortical network, especially the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In contrast, during  the less demanding (1-back) level of the task, gaming was associated with decreased  activity in the same cortical regions. Our results suggest that a greater degree of  daily gaming experience is associated with better working memory functioning and  task difficulty-dependent modulation in fronto-parietal brain activity already in  adolescence and even when non-expert gamers are studied. The direction of causality  within this association cannot be inferred with certainty due to the correlational  nature of the current study.","2017-01-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","204-215","","","1655","","Brain Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to investigate  cortical activation related to verbal WM in dyslexic and normal readers aged around  13 years, controlling for phonological awareness processing. We used a modified WM  n-back task where the participants remembered the first or last speech segment  (phonemes) of the names of common objects shown as pictures. Dyslexic readers were  impaired compared with the control group. Compared with the dyslexic readers,  controls showed increased fMRI activation in the left superior parietal lobule and  the right inferior prefrontal gyrus. Unlike controls, dyslexics did not show a  significant increase in activation in WM areas with increased memory load.

Here, we used an n-back task (Experiment 1) and an adaptation paradigm (Experiment  2) to distinguish memory-related activity from that associated with goal-directed  action. In Experiment 1, participants indicated, in separate blocks of trials,  whether the incoming stimulus was presented at the same location as in the previous  trial (1-back) or two trials ago (2-back). Prior to a block of trials, participants  were told to use their left or right index finger. Accuracy and reaction times were  worse for the 2-back than for the 1-back condition. The analysis of functional  magnetic resonance imaging data revealed greater sustained task-related activity in  the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and superior frontal sulcus during 2-back than  1-back after accounting for response-related activity elicited by the targets.  Target detection and response execution were also associated with enhanced activity  in the IPL bilaterally, though the activation was anterior to that associated with  sustained task-related activity. In Experiment 2, we used an event-related design in  which participants listened (no response required) to trials that comprised four  sounds presented either at the same location or at four different locations. We  found larger IPL activation for changes in sound location than for sounds presented  at the same location. The IPL activation overlapped with that observed during the  auditory spatial working memory task. Together, these results provide converging  evidence supporting the role of parietal cortex in auditory spatial working memory  which can be dissociated from response selection and execution.","2010","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","202","","","1","","Front Psychol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 21833258  PMCID: PMC3153808","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\3AMDJCLH\Alain et al. - 2010 - Dissociable memory- and response-related activity .pdf","","fMRI; attention; auditory; dorsal stream; goal-directed action; motor response; parietal cortex; spatial","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study  used a pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design to  determine mifepristone effects on visuospatial paired associates learning (vPAL) and  n-back working memory (WM) fMRI task related brain activations. 20 right-handed  healthy male participants received 600 mg mifepristone or placebo on two separate  imaging days and each participant performed fMRI tasks four hours later. The effect  of mifepristone on task related brain activations was determined using Region of  Interest (ROI) fMRI analyses and an exploratory whole brain voxel-wise fMRI task  analyses was also conducted. The vPAL task ROI analysis found that mifepristone  administration was significantly associated with decreased fusiform cortex  activations in first and second encoding blocks (p = 0.007, p = 0.04) and decreased  angular and precuneal cortices activations in the first recall block (p = 0.01,  p = 0.02). There were no significant differences in fMRI brain activations  associated with mifepristone administration in the n-back task ROI's (all p > 0.05).  Mifepristone administration did not significantly affect fMRI brain activations in  the whole brain voxel-wise analyses for both tasks. N-back and vPAL task reaction  times and accuracy were similar in both mifepristone and placebo conditions (all  p > 0.05). Our finding of decreased fusiform, angular and precuneal vPAL task  related brain activity associated with mifepristone administration for the same  behavioural performance as found in the placebo condition may represent improved  efficiency of visuospatial memory encoding and recall. These findings provide  evidence that mifepristone may enhance the efficiency of human visuospatial memory  and calls for further studies in patient populations using an fMRI approach to  provide proof of concept for new treatments.","2021-03","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","105116","","","125","","Psychoneuroendocrinology","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

OBJECTIVE: To map anhedonia in children onto changes in intrinsic  large-scale connectivity and task-evoked activation and to probe the specificity of  these changes in anhedonia against other clinical phenotypes (low mood, anxiety, and  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were from the first annual release  of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, collected between September  2016 and September 2017 and analyzed between April and September 2018.  Cross-sectional data of children aged 9 to 10 years from unreferred, community  samples during rest (n = 2878) and during reward anticipation (n = 2874) and working  memory (n = 2745) were analyzed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Alterations in fMRI  data during rest, reward anticipation, and working memory were examined, using both  frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Functional MRI connectivity within large-scale  networks, between networks, and between networks and subcortical regions were  examined during rest. Functional MRI activation were examined during reward  anticipation and working memory using the monetary incentive delayed and N-back  tasks, respectively. RESULTS: Among 2878 children with adequate-quality  resting-state fMRI data (mean [SD] age, 10.03 [0.62] years; 1400 girls [48.6%]),  children with anhedonia (261 [9.1%]), compared with those without anhedonia (2617  [90.9%]), showed hypoconnectivity among various large-scale networks and subcortical  regions, including between the arousal-related cingulo-opercular network and  reward-related ventral striatum area (mean [SD] with anhedonia, 0.08 [0.10] vs  without anhedonia, 0.10 [0.10]; t2,876 = 3.33; P < .001; q[false discovery  rate] = 0.03; ln[Bayes factor10] = 2.85). Such hypoconnectivity did not manifest  among children with low mood (277 of 2878 [9.62%]), anxiety (109 of 2878 [3.79%]),  or ADHD (459 of 2878 [15.95%]), suggesting specificity. Similarly, among 2874  children (mean [SD] age, 10.03 [0.62] years; 1414 girls [49.2%]) with high-quality  task-evoked fMRI data, children with anhedonia (248 of 2874 [8.63%]) demonstrated  hypoactivation during reward anticipation in various areas, including the dorsal  striatum and areas of the cingulo-opercular network. This hypoactivity was not found  among children with low mood (268 of 2874 [9.32%]), anxiety (90 of 2874 [3.13%]), or  ADHD (473 of 2874 [16.46%]). Moreover, we also found context- and phenotype-specific  double dissociations; while children with anhedonia showed altered activation during  reward anticipation (but not working memory), those with ADHD showed altered  activation during working memory (but not reward anticipation). CONCLUSIONS AND  RELEVANCE: Using the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study data set,  phenotype-specific alterations were found in intrinsic large-scale connectivity and  task-evoked activation in children with anhedonia. The hypoconnectivity at rest and  hypoactivation during reward anticipation complementarily map anhedonia onto  aberrations in neural-cognitive processes: lack of intrinsic reward-arousal  integration during rest and diminishment of extrinsic reward-arousal activity during  reward anticipation. These findings help delineate the pathophysiological  underpinnings of anhedonia in children.","2019-06-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","624-633","","6","76","","JAMA Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 30865236  PMCID: PMC6552295","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\AKMRQZK2\Pornpattananangkul et al. - 2019 - Association Between Childhood Anhedonia and Altera.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Child; Brain Mapping; Cognition/physiology; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Brain/*diagnostic imaging; Cross-Sectional Studies; Functional Neuroimaging; Anhedonia/*physiology; Anticipation, Psychological/*physiology; Nerve Net/*diagnostic imaging; Reward","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, that the brain activation pattern  associated to WM processes in elderly during successful low load tasks is located in  posterior sensory and associative areas; second, that the prefrontal and parietal  cortex and basal ganglia should be more active during high-demand tasks; third, that  cerebellar activations are related to high-demand cognitive tasks and have a  specific lateralization depending on the condition. METHODS: We used a  neuropsychological assessment with functional magnetic resonance imaging and a core  N-back paradigm design that was maintained across the combination of four conditions  of stimuli and two memory loads in a sample of twenty elderly subjects. RESULTS:  During low-loads, activations were located in the visual ventral network. In high  loads, there was an involvement of the basal ganglia and cerebellum in addition to  the frontal and parietal cortices. Moreover, we detected an executive control role  of the cerebellum in a relatively symmetric fronto-parietal network. Nevertheless,  this network showed a predominantly left lateralization in parietal regions  associated presumably with an overuse of verbal storage strategies. The differential  activations between conditions were stimuli-dependent and were located in sensory  areas. CONCLUSION: Successful WM processes in the elderly population are accompanied  by an activation pattern that involves cerebellar regions working together with a  fronto-parietal network.","2015","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","e0131536","","7","10","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 26132286  PMCID: PMC4488500","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\AWZLMLRH\Luis et al. - 2015 - Successful Working Memory Processes and Cerebellum.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Aged; Middle Aged; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Brain Mapping; Brain/physiology; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Cerebellum/*physiology; Functional Neuroimaging; Aging/*psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The work of Don Stuss and others  has demonstrated that frontal and parietal cortices are crucial to cognitive  control, particularly in normal aging, which is characterized by reduced control  mechanisms. However, the structure-function relationships specific to each domain  and subsequent impact on performance are not well understood. In the current study,  we examined both age and individual differences in functional activity associated  with core domains of cognitive control in relation to fronto-parietal structure and  task performance. Participants (N = 140, aged 20-86 years) completed three fMRI  tasks: go/no-go (inhibition), task switching (shifting), and n-back (working  memory), in addition to structural and diffusion imaging. All three tasks engaged a  common set of fronto-parietal regions; however, the contributions of age, brain  structure, and task performance to functional activity were unique to each domain.  Aging was associated with differences in functional activity for all tasks, largely  in regions outside common fronto-parietal control regions. Shifting and inhibition  showed greater contributions of structure to overall decreases in brain activity,  suggesting that more intact fronto-parietal structure may serve as a scaffold for  efficient functional response. Working memory showed no contribution of structure to  functional activity but had strong effects of age and task performance. Together,  these results provide a comprehensive and novel examination of the joint  contributions of aging, performance, and brain structure to functional activity  across multiple domains of cognitive control.","2021-02-05","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1-22","","","","","J Cogn Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 33544059","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\F4IB3MNJ\Rieck et al. - 2021 - Contributions of Brain Function and Structure to T.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study merged clinical neuropsychology  and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the construct validity  of the letter variant of the n-back task (LNB) and to further identify the  task-evoked networks involved in WM. Construct validity of the LNB task was  investigated using a bootstrapping approach to correlate LNB task performance across  clinically validated neuropsychological measures of WM to establish convergent  validity, as well as measures of related but distinct cognitive constructs (i.e.,  attention and short-term memory) to establish discriminant validity. Independent  component analysis (ICA) identified brain networks active during the LNB task in 34  healthy control participants, and general linear modeling determined  task-relatedness of these networks. Bootstrap correlation analyses revealed moderate  to high correlations among measures expected to converge with LNB (|ρ|≥ 0.37) and  weak correlations among measures expected to discriminate (|ρ|≤ 0.29), controlling  for age and education. ICA identified 35 independent networks, 17 of which  demonstrated engagement significantly related to task condition, controlling for  reaction time variability. Of these, the bilateral frontoparietal networks,  bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, bilateral superior parietal lobules  including precuneus, and frontoinsular network were preferentially recruited by the  2-back condition compared to 0-back control condition, indicating WM involvement.  These results support the use of the LNB as a measure of WM and confirm its use in  probing the network-level neural correlates of WM processing.","2014-08","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","736-750","","7","20","","J Int Neuropsychol Soc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 24963641  PMCID: PMC4290162","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\NC83CMQM\Kearney-Ramos et al. - 2014 - Merging clinical neuropsychology and functional ne.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; *Brain Mapping; Oxygen/blood; Cognition/*physiology; Linear Models; *Neuropsychological Tests; Brain/blood supply/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It continues to be produced after menopause and provides  estrogenicity after depletion of ovarian hormones. Estradiol depletion contributes  to memory circuitry changes over menopause, including changes in hippocampal (HIPP)  and dorsolateral- and ventrolateral-prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; VLPFC) function.  Further, major depressive disorder (MDD) patients have, in general, lower levels of  estradiol and lower DHEAS than healthy controls, thus potentially a higher risk of  adverse menopausal outcomes. We investigated whether higher DHEAS levels after  menopause is associated with better memory circuitry function, especially in women  with MDD. 212 adults (ages 45-55, 50% women) underwent clinical and fMRI testing.  Participants performed a working memory (WM) N-back task and an episodic memory  verbal encoding (VE) task during fMRI scanning. DHEAS levels were significantly  associated with memory circuitry function, specifically in MDD postmenopausal women.  On the WM task, lower DHEAS levels were associated with increased HIPP activity. On  the VE task, lower DHEAS levels were associated with decreased activity in the HIPP  and VLPFC. In contrast, there was no association between DHEAS levels and memory  circuitry function in MDD pre/perimenopausal women, men, and non-MDD participants  regardless of sex and reproductive status. In fact, MDD postmenopausal women with  higher levels of DHEAS were similar to MDD pre/perimenopausal women and men. Thus,  memory circuitry deficits associated with MDD and a lower ability of the adrenal  gland to produce DHEAS after menopause may contribute to a lower ability to maintain  intact memory function with age.","2019-10-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","146303","","","1721","","Brain Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We evaluated effective connectivity under an N-back working memory  task in 24 participants using stochastic dynamic causal modelling (DCM) of 7 T fMRI  data. We repeated the analysis using resting-state data, from the same subjects, to  model connectivity among the same brain regions engaged by the N-back task. This  allowed us to: (i) examine the relationship between intrinsic (task-independent)  effective connectivity during resting (A(rest)) and task states (A(task)), (ii)  cluster phenotypes of task-related changes in effective connectivity (B(task))  across participants, (iii) identify edges (B(task)) showing high inter-individual  effective connectivity differences and (iv) associate reaction times with the  similarity between B(task) and A(rest) in these edges. We found a strong correlation  between A(rest) and A(task) over subjects but a marked difference between B(task)  and A(rest). We further observed a strong clustering of individuals in terms of  B(task), which was not apparent in A(rest). The task-related effective connectivity  B(task) varied highly in the edges from the parietal to the frontal lobes across  individuals, so the three groups were clustered mainly by the effective connectivity  within these networks. The similarity between B(task) and A(rest) at the edges from  the parietal to the frontal lobes was positively correlated with 2-back reaction  times. This result implies that a greater change in context-sensitive coupling -  from resting-state connectivity - is associated with faster reaction times. In  summary, task-dependent connectivity endows resting-state connectivity with a  context sensitivity, which predicts the speed of information processing during the  N-back task.","2018-04-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","485-495","","","169","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Traditionally, techniques such as PCA and ICA, which rely on strong  non-physiological assumptions such as orthogonality and statistical independence,  have been used for this purpose. Recently, tensor decomposition techniques such as  parallel factor analysis have gained more popularity in neuroimaging applications as  they are able to inherently contain the multidimensionality of neuroimaging data and  achieve uniqueness in decomposition without making strong assumptions. Previously,  the coupled matrix-tensor decomposition (CMTD) has been applied for the fusion of  the EEG and fMRI. Only recently the coupled tensor-tensor decomposition (CTTD) has  been proposed. Here for the first time, we propose the use of CTTD of a 4th order  EEG tensor (space, time, frequency, and participant) and 3rd order fMRI tensor  (space, time, participant), coupled partially in time and participant domains, for  the extraction of the task related features in both modalities. We used both the  sensor-level and source-level EEG for the coupling. The phase shifted paradigm  signals were incorporated as the temporal initializers of the CTTD to extract the  task related features. The validation of the approach is demonstrated on  simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings from six participants performing an N-Back memory  task. The EEG and fMRI tensors were coupled in 9 components out of which seven  components had a high correlation (more than 0.85) with the task. The result of the  fusion recapitulates the well-known attention network as being positively, and the  default mode network working negatively time-locked to the memory task.","2020-09","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","636-650","","5","33","","Brain Topogr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 32728794","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\NFZTYG28\Jonmohamadi et al. - 2020 - Extraction of Common Task Features in EEG-fMRI Dat.pdf","","Humans; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; *fMRI; Neuroimaging; *Brain/diagnostic imaging; *EEG; *Electroencephalography; *Fusion; *PARAFAC; *Tensor decomposition; Factor Analysis, Statistical","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHOD: Participants (n=33) were medication-free and mostly euthymic  while performing a 1-back and a 2-back task in the fMRI scanner. Differential  activation results between the tasks were assessed globally and within seven  predefined regions of interest associated with working memory activation. The  patient groups were compared with healthy women and matched for age, handedness, and  length of education. RESULTS: Poor task modulation was observed in both RBD groups  in the prefrontal cortex (BA9) in the 1-back task and activation during the 2-back  task, particularly in a subgroup with a history of brief hypomanic episodes (RBD-H)  compared with the subgroup without such episodes (RBD-O). Task modulation in the  right parahippocampal gyrus (BA27) distinguished the RBD-O group, and task  modulation in the right insula clearly distinguished the RBD-H group. LIMITATIONS:  Small sample size and recruitment of most patients through media that may induce a  selection bias towards better-functioning subjects. CONCLUSION: The observed lack of  deactivation within the right insula has also been reported in patients with bipolar  I disorders. Activation differences in BA9 and the parahippocampal region between  RBD patients with and without a history of hypomania suggest different functional  hypersensitivity of early limbic regions and ability to sustain attention and  working memory, respectively, possibly identifying functional differences between  the two subgroups.","2013-07","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","383-392","","1-3","149","","J Affect Disord","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, previous  behavioural results are discrepant as are the few functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI) results collected in adults and adolescents with ASD. Here we  investigate the precise temporal dynamics of WM-related brain activity using  magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 20 children with ASD and matched controls during an  n-back WM task across different load levels (1-back vs 2-back). Although behavioural  results were similar between ASD and typically developing (TD) children, the  between-group comparison performed on functional brain activity showed atypical  WM-related brain processes in children with ASD compared with TD children. These  atypical responses were observed in the ASD group from 200 to 600 ms post stimulus  in both the low- (1-back) and high- (2-back) memory load conditions. During the  1-back condition, children with ASD showed reduced WM-related activations in the  right hippocampus and the cingulate gyrus compared with TD children who showed more  activation in the left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex and the insulae. In the  2-back condition, children with ASD showed less activity in the left insula and  midcingulate gyrus and more activity in the left precuneus than TD children. In  addition, reduced activity in the anterior cingulate cortex was correlated with  symptom severity in children with ASD. Thus, this MEG study identified the precise  timing and sources of atypical WM-related activity in frontal, temporal and parietal  regions in children with ASD. The potential impacts of such atypicalities on social  deficits of autism are discussed.","2015-08-11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","e617","","8","5","","Transl Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 26261885  PMCID: PMC4564562","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\L86HBZI5\Urbain et al. - 2015 - Atypical spatiotemporal signatures of working memo.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Child; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Brain/*physiopathology; Brain Mapping/*methods; Time; Task Performance and Analysis; Neural Pathways/physiopathology; Autistic Disorder/*physiopathology; Magnetoencephalography/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In adults, WM ensures efficient cognitive  processing by focusing on task-relevant information while suppressing distractors.  It has been well documented that WM can be influenced by emotional stimuli, which  may facilitate the retention of information, interfere with uptake, or even affect  its capacity. We evaluated the effect of T1D on visual WM processing using emotional  faces as stimuli, in young patients with satisfactory clinical evolution, and  matched controls without T1D. All subjects performed a 2-back task detecting facial  identity using neutral, happy or fearful faces in a block design for fMRI.  Behavioral performance was similar with the exception that patients responded  significantly slower. Most importantly, between-group differences were found in  patterns of brain activation. In comparison, more widespread brain activation  -predominantly prefrontal- was found in the participants with T1D when processing  neutral faces, while a decrease was observed when processing happy and fearful ones.  Statistical contrasts demonstrated significantly-different activation patterns  between groups when processing emotional faces, as controls exhibited greater  activation in the cuneus, posterior cortex and parahippocampal gyrus, while the  patients showed greater activation in the prefrontal structures. Results may reflect  compensatory efforts made to minimize the deleterious effects of disease development  on attention allocation processes and the operational efficiency of WM.

The functional integration perspective further  suggests that working memory performance also modulates differences in functional  interactions of the DLPFC between patients and controls. To explore this  possibility, 45 healthy controls and 45 patients with schizophrenia were recruited  to perform a 2-back task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Each  group was further divided into two subgroups based on task performance to examine  the modulatory effect of performance on functional interactions of the DLPFC, as  measured via psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses. We observed that, in  patients with schizophrenia who exhibited impaired working memory capacity and  decreased brain activation/deactivation, functional interactions between the  right/left DLPFC and angular cortex were decreased relative to those of healthy  controls. Furthermore, we observed an interaction effect of working memory  performance and diagnosis on functional connectivity between the right/left DLPFC  seed region and posterior regions such as the angular cortex, fusiform gyrus, and  middle occipital gyrus. This interaction effect was mainly driven by the negative  correlation between functional connectivity and performance in healthy controls, and  by the positive correlation in patients with schizophrenia. These results  demonstrate the effects of inter-individual differences in working memory  performance on functional interactions between the DLPFC and posterior regions in  patients with schizophrenia as well as healthy controls, which may shed new light on  the neural basis of working memory.","2017","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","56","","","8","","Front Psychol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 28289394  PMCID: PMC5326798","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\BSBR8B4T\Wu et al. - 2017 - Task Performance Modulates Functional Connectivity.pdf","","schizophrenia; fMRI; N-back; fusiform gyrus; inferior parietal lobule (IPL); middle frontal gyrus; psychophysiological interaction (PPI)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, a comprehensive review  of fMRI studies, spanning almost one decade, was carried out to observe for general  trends with respect to brain regions and cognitive systems most likely to be  dysfunctional in CHR individuals. 32 studies were included for this review, out of  which 22 met the criteria for quantitative analysis using activation likelihood  estimation (ALE).

Findings from the ALE implicated four key dysfunctional and distinct neural regions  in the CHR group, namely the right inferior parietal lobule (rIPL), the left medial  frontal gyrus (lmFG), the left superior temporal gyrus (lSTG) and the right  fronto-polar cortex (rFPC) of the superior frontal gyrus (SFG).

Auditory distraction is a frequently cited symptom in adults with attention deficit  hyperactivity disorder (aADHD)-yet few task-based fMRI studies have explored whether  deficits in cognitive control (associated with the disorder) impedes on the ability  to suppress/compensate for exogenously evoked cortical responses to noise in this  population. In the current study, we explored the effects of auditory distraction as  function of working memory (WM) load. Participants completed two tasks: an auditory  target detection (ATD) task in which the goal was to actively detect salient oddball  tones amidst a stream of standard tones in noise, and a visual n-back task  consisting of 0-, 1-, and 2-back WM conditions whilst concurrently ignoring the same  tonal signal from the ATD task. Results indicated that our sample of young aADHD (n  = 17), compared to typically developed controls (n = 17), had difficulty attenuating  auditory cortical responses to the task-irrelevant sound when WM demands were high  (2-back). Heightened auditory activity to task-irrelevant sound was associated with  both poorer WM performance and symptomatic inattentiveness. In the ATD task, we  observed a significant increase in functional communications between auditory and  salience networks in aADHD. Because performance outcomes were on par with controls  for this task, we suggest that this increased functional connectivity in aADHD was  likely an adaptive mechanism for suboptimal listening conditions. Taken together,  our results indicate that aADHD are more susceptible to noise interference when they  are engaged in a primary task. The ability to cope with auditory distraction appears  to be related to the WM demands of the task and thus the capacity to deploy  cognitive control.","2021","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","771711","","","15","","Front Hum Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Blomberg, Johansson Capusan, Signoret, Danielsson and Rönnberg.","","","","","","PMID: 34916918  PMCID: PMC8670091","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\B2JKPFWR\Blomberg et al. - 2021 - The Effects of Working Memory Load on Auditory Dis.pdf","","working memory; task-based fMRI; attention; adults; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; auditory distraction; cognitive control; salience network (SN)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  objective of this study was to characterize working memory deficits in children with  TLE via activation of the executive control network on functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI) and determine the relationships to fMRI behavioral findings and  traditional neuropsychological tests. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Functional magnetic  resonance imaging was conducted on 17 children with TLE and 18 healthy control  participants (age 8-16 years) while they performed the N-back task in order to  assess activation of the executive control network. N-back accuracy, N-back reaction  time, and traditional neuropsychological tests (Delis-Kaplan Executive Function  System [D-KEFS] color-word interference and card-sort test) were also assessed.  PRINCIPAL OBSERVATIONS: Children with TLE exhibited executive dysfunction on D-KEFS  testing, reduced N-back accuracy, and increased N-back reaction time compared with  healthy controls; D-KEFS and N-back behavioral findings were significantly  correlated. Children with TLE also exhibited significant reduction in activation of  the frontal lobe within the executive control network compared to healthy controls.  These alterations were significantly correlated with N-back behavioral findings and  D-KEFS testing. CONCLUSIONS: Children with TLE exhibit executive dysfunction, which  correlates with executive control network alterations. This lends validity to the  theory that the executive control network contributes to working memory function.

In this work, we combined  n-back practice with fMRI-NFT of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to  better understand the relationship between open- and closed-loop neuromodulation.  FMRI data were acquired during both traditional n-back and NFT across five imaging  sessions. Region-of-interest (ROI) and voxel-wise 2 × 2 within subjects ANOVAs were  carried out to determine the effects of, and interaction between, training session  and neuromodulation type. A main effect of training session was identified for only  a single, highly focused cluster that shared spatial properties with the fMRI-NFT  target region (left DLPFC). This finding indicates that combined open- and  closed-loop neuroplastic enhancement techniques result in focal changes that are  confined to the target area of NFT, and do not affect up- or down-stream network  components that are normally engaged during working memory. Additionally, we  identified a main effect of neuromodulation type for 15 clusters with significantly  different activation between open- and closed-loop neuromodulation during training,  12 of which demonstrated higher activity during the open-loop neuromodulation. Our  results, taken together with previous reports, indicate that fMRI-NFT combined with  n-back practice leads to a highly focal volume exhibiting neuroplasticity without  additional network effects.","2016","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","138","","","10","","Front Behav Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 27445733  PMCID: PMC4923251","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\PUSQUDNI\Sherwood et al. - 2016 - Combining Real-Time fMRI Neurofeedback Training of.pdf","","fMRI; n-back; DLPFC; neurofeedback; neuromodulation; plasticity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most  ADHD research has focused on the neural correlates of nonspatial mnemonic processes.  This study examined brain activation and functional connectivity for visuospatial  working memory in youth with and without ADHD. METHOD: Twenty-four youth with ADHD  and 21 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were scanned with functional magnetic  resonance imaging while performing an N-back test of working memory for spatial  position. Block-design analyses contrasted activation and functional connectivity  separately for high (2-back) and low (1-back) working memory load conditions versus  the control condition (0-back). The effect of working memory load was modeled with  linear contrasts. RESULTS: The 2 groups performed comparably on the task and  demonstrated similar patterns of frontoparietal activation, with no differences in  linear gains in activation as working memory load increased. However, youth with  ADHD showed greater activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)  and left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), greater functional connectivity between  the left DLPFC and left intraparietal sulcus, and reduced left DLPFC connectivity  with left midcingulate cortex and PCC for the high load contrast compared to  controls (p < .01; k > 100 voxels). Reanalysis using a more conservative statistical  approach (p < .001; k > 100 voxels) yielded group differences in PCC activation and  DLPFC-midcingulate connectivity. CONCLUSION: Youth with ADHD show decreased  efficiency of DLPFC for high-load visuospatial working memory and greater reliance  on posterior spatial attention circuits to store and update spatial position than  healthy control youth. Findings should be replicated in larger samples.","2014-09","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1020-1030.e6","","9","53","","J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

Recent drug development  has targeted enhanced NMDA function by increasing mGluR2/3 signaling. However, the  clinical utility of such agents remains uncertain, and markers of brain circuit  function are critical for clarifying mechanisms and understanding individual  differences in efficacy. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized  cross-over (14 day washout) pilot study evaluating adjunctive use of the mGluR2  positive allosteric modulator AZD8529 (80 mg daily for 3 days), in chronic stable  patients with schizophrenia (n = 26 analyzed). We focused on 3 T fMRI response in  frontostriatal regions during an n-back working memory task, testing the hypothesis  that AZD8529 produces fMRI changes that correlate with improvement in negative  symptoms and cognition. We found that AZD8529 did not produce significant  group-average effects on symptoms or cognitive accuracy. However, AZD8529 did  increase n-back fMRI activation in striatum (p < 0.0001) and anterior  cingulate/paracingulate (p = 0.002). Greater drug-versus-placebo effects on caudate  activation significantly correlated with greater reductions in PANSS negative  symptom scores (r = -0.42, p = 0.031), and exploratory correlations suggested  broader effects across multiple symptom domains and regions of interest. These  findings demonstrate that fMRI responses to mGluR2 positive modulation relate to  individual differences in symptom reduction, and could be pursued for future  biomarker development. Negative clinical results at the group level should not lead  to premature termination of investigation of this mechanism, which may benefit an  important subset of individuals with schizophrenia. Imaging biomarkers may reveal  therapeutic mechanisms, and help guide treatment toward specific populations.","2021-10-20","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","","","","","","Mol Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021.

The characteristics of cognitive impairment in PD are  executive function (including working memory) and visuo-perceptual processing. The  visuospatial n-back test has the merit of minimizing the influence of educational  biases involved in the verbal n-back test. Furthermore, it can assess both  visuospatial recognition and working memory in a single test. METHODS: We aimed to  clarify the advantage of the visuospatial n-back test as a tool for detecting  impairments of working memory in PD. We enrolled 28 right-handed patients with PD  (18 males, 10 females) and 12 age-matched healthy controls (HC; 7 males, 5 females).  Thirteen patients were classified as MCI (PD-MCI), and 15 as cognitively normal PD  (PD-CN). Using functional MRI (fMRI), we explored the specific brain regions  associated with the performance of the n-back test in the PD-MCI, PD-CN, and HC  groups. The 0-back test assesses visuospatial recognition, while the 1-back and  2-back tests assess visuospatial working memory. Group comparisons were performed  for three loads of this test. RESULTS: Patients with PD performed significantly  worse in terms of the correct answer rates of all n-back tests compared with HC.  fMRI analyses performed during the 2-back test revealed reduced activation in the  bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and parietal  lobule in the PD group compared with the HC group. In contrast, the fMRI result  during the 0-back test showed only a marginal difference in the frontal lobe. On  comparisons of task performance between the PD-MCI and PD-CN groups, we found that  the correct answer rate in the 2-back test was lower in the PD-MCI group than in the  PD-CN group. However, scores of the 0-back and 1-back tests were not significantly  different between the two groups. The fMRI findings revealed that activations within  the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) during the 2-back  test were reduced in the patients with PD-MCI when compared to those with PD-CN.  CONCLUSIONS: This study reports reduced activation of the MFG and IPL in patients  with PD-MCI. These regions may be associated with the pathophysiology of working  memory impairment in patients with PD, which involves fronto-striatal network  dysfunction.","2021-09-03","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","335","","1","21","","BMC Neurol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021.

For working memory, dysfunctional activation of lateral prefrontal and  cingulate cortex has been reported in the acute episode. This study investigates  working-memory function and its neurobiological correlate in euthymic MDD patients,  particularly whether dysfunctional activation persists when depressive symptoms  improve. We investigated 56 subjects with functional magnetic resonance imaging  (fMRI) at 3 Tesla. To challenge working-memory function, a classical verbal n-back  task (0-, 1-, and 2-back) was used in 28 well-characterized, euthymic, unipolar MDD  patients and 28 healthy control subjects matched according to age, sex, and  educational level. Data were analyzed using SPM5. In the absence of significant  behavioral differences, we observed comparable overall patterns of brain activation  in both groups. As expected, both groups showed stronger activation of the typical  working-memory network with increasing memory load. However, significant  hyperactivation of the cingulate cortex was observed in euthymic patients, while  lateral prefrontal activation was comparable between patients and controls.  Working-memory challenge in the euthymic state of MDD revealed a dissociation of  lateral prefrontal and cingulate brain function. Cingulate function, which is  important for both emotional and cognitive processing and their integration, is  still abnormal when mood is restored. This could reflect a different speed of  normalization in prefrontal and limbic cortices, persistent systematic changes in  neuronal networks after an episode of MDD, or a compensatory mechanism to maintain  working-memory performance.","2009-09","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","2746-2756","","9","30","","Hum Brain Mapp","","","","","","","","eng","2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","","","","","","PMID: 19086021  PMCID: PMC6870640","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\68ELNE4T\Schöning et al. - 2009 - Working-memory fMRI reveals cingulate hyperactivat.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Sensitivity and Specificity; Young Adult; Cognition/physiology; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Neuropsychological Tests; Emotions/physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods; Brain Mapping/methods; Predictive Value of Tests; Depressive Disorder, Major/complications/diagnosis/*physiopathology; Evoked Potentials/physiology; Gyrus Cinguli/anatomy & histology/*physiopathology; Memory Disorders/diagnosis/etiology/*physiopathology; Nerve Net/anatomy & histology/physiopathology; Neural Pathways/anatomy & histology/physiopathology; Prefrontal Cortex/anatomy & histology/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there exists no treatment with replicated and  robust efficacy on cognition in BD. This is partially due to limited insight into  the neuronal underpinnings of cognitive impairment in these patients. This is the  first study to investigate neuronal underpinnings of cognitive impairment in a large  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset comparing neural activity  patterns between distinct neurocognitive subgroups of partially or fully remitted  patients with BD. METHODS: Patients (n = 153) and healthy controls (HC) (n = 52)  underwent neuropsychological assessment and fMRI, during which they performed a  verbal N-back working memory (WM) task. Based on hierarchical cluster analysis of  neuropsychological test performance, patients were grouped into one of two  neurocognitive subgroups (cognitively impaired, n = 91; cognitively normal compared  to HC, n = 62) that were compared on WM-related neural activity. RESULTS:  Cognitively impaired patients displayed WM-related hypo-activity in left  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and frontal and parietal regions within a cognitive  control network (CCN) as well as hyper-activity in the default mode network (DMN)  compared to cognitively normal patients. In contrast, cognitively normal patients  only exhibited hypo-activity within a small cluster in the superior frontal gyrus  relative to HC. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairment in BD seems to originate from a  failure to recruit key regions in the CCN and to suppress task-irrelevant DMN  activity during cognitive performance. These results highlight modulation of  aberrant dorsal prefrontal and DMN activity as a putative target for pro-cognitive  treatment in BD.","2022-02","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","69-81","","1","24","","Bipolar Disord","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, nonlinear  (inverted-U-shaped) associations between neuronal activity and task difficulty can  lead to misinterpretation of group differences between patients and healthy  comparison subjects (HCs). In this paper, we evaluated a novel method for correcting  these misinterpretations based on conditional performance analysis. METHOD:  Participants included 25 HCs and 27 SZs who performed a working memory (WM) task  (N-back) with 5 load conditions while undergoing fMRI. Neuronal activity was  regressed onto: 1) task load (i.e., parametric task levels), 2) marginal task  performance (i.e., performance averaged over all load conditions), or 3) conditional  task performance (i.e., performance within each load condition). RESULTS: In most  regions of interest, conditional performance analysis uniquely revealed  inverted-U-shaped neuronal activity in both SZs and HCs. After accounting for  conditional performance differences between groups, we observed few difference in  both the pattern and level of neuronal activity between SZs and HCs within regions  that are classically associated with WM functioning (e.g., posterior dorsolateral  prefrontal and parietal association cortices). However, SZs did show aberrant  activity within the anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS:  Interpretations of differences in neuronal activity between groups, and of  associations between neuronal activity and performance, should be considered within  the context of task performance. Whether conditional performance-based differences  reflect compensation, dedifferentiation, or other processes is not a question that  is easily resolved by examining activation and performance data alone.","2021-05-05","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1-12","","","","","J Int Neuropsychol Soc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 33949299  PMCID: PMC8568731","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\SFIGXVH3\Thomas et al. - 2021 - Detecting the Inverted-U in fMRI Studies of Schizo.pdf","","Neuroimaging; Schizophrenia; Psychometrics; Confounds; Working Memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  conclusions that can be drawn from these studies are not clear cut but suggest that  even though gender differences might not be apparent from behavioural measures, the  underlying neural substrate associated with working memory might be different in men  and women. Previous research suggests activation in a network of frontal and  parietal regions during working memory tasks.

RESULTS: The fMRI scan found that a neural  network consisting of bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), bilateral  premotor area (PreMA), supplementary motor area/anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral  parietal lobe (PA) and right caudate nucleus/thalamus was activated, with right  hemisphere dominance. In euthyroid subjects, all these regions of interest (ROIs)  showed load effect; however, only left DLPFC, left PA, bilateral PreMA and right  caudate nucleus/thalamus showed the same effect in Pre-SCH patients. Furthermore,  activation intensities of most ROIs (especially DLPFC and right PA) for Pre-SCH  patients were lower than those in the euthyroid subjects (F <3.046, p > 0.062).  Importantly, after a 6-month treatment with LT4, the load effect in SCH patients  appeared the same as in the euthyroid subjects in all the ROIs (F >13.176, p <  0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our previous study shows that verbal working memory of SCH  patients is impaired with abnormal activity in bilateral frontal areas. In this  study, the results indicated that SCH patients may also have spatial working memory  impairments, and the altered activities of right DLPFC and right posterior parietal  lobe may be one of the underlying neural mechanisms. Most importantly, this study  shows that LT4 replacement therapy can improve the memory impairment and reverse the  altered neural activity network.","2013","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","260-270","","3","97","","Neuroendocrinology","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2012 S.

Thirty  mTBI patients were examined during the chronic stage of injury and compared to 28  control participants. Demographics and behavioral performance were matched across  groups. Due to the diffuse nature of injury, we hypothesized that there would be an  imbalance in the communication between task-positive and Default Mode Network (DMN)  regions in the context of effortful task execution. Specifically, a graph-theoretic  measure of modularity was used to quantify the extent to which groups of brain  regions tended to segregate into task-positive and DMN sub-networks.

Functional MRI (fMRI) studies demonstrate that  working memory involves a bilateral frontoparietal network the activation of which  is disrupted in hippocampal sclerosis (HS). A specific role of the hippocampus to  deactivate during working memory has been proposed with this mechanism faulty in  patients with HS. Structural correlates of disrupted working memory in HS have not  been explored. METHODS: We studied 54 individuals with medically refractory TLE and  unilateral HS (29 left) and 28 healthy controls. Subjects underwent 3T structural  MRI, a visuospatial n-back fMRI paradigm and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Working  memory capacity assessed by three span tasks (digit span backwards, gesture span,  motor sequences) was combined with performance in the visuospatial paradigm to give  a global working memory measure. Gray and white matter changes were investigated  using voxel-based morphometry and voxel-based analysis of DTI, respectively. KEY  FINDINGS: Individuals with left or right HS performed less well than healthy  controls on all measures of working memory. fMRI demonstrated a bilateral  frontoparietal network during the working memory task with reduced activation of the  right parietal lobe in both patient groups. In left HS, gray matter loss was seen in  the ipsilateral hippocampus and parietal lobe, with maintenance of the gray matter  volume of the contralateral parietal lobe associated with better performance. White  matter integrity within the frontoparietal network, in particular the superior  longitudinal fasciculus and cingulum, and the contralateral temporal lobe, was  associated with working memory performance. In right HS, gray matter loss was also  seen in the ipsilateral hippocampus and parietal lobe. Working memory performance  correlated with the gray matter volume of both frontal lobes and white matter  integrity within the frontoparietal network and contralateral temporal lobe.  SIGNIFICANCE: Our data provide further evidence that working memory is disrupted in  HS and impaired integrity of both gray and white matter is seen in functionally  relevant areas.

The second aim was to investigate whether  different areas of the cerebellar cortex and nuclei contribute to different working  memory tasks (n-back vs. Sternberg tasks). Young and healthy subjects participated  in two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies using a 7 T MR scanner  with its increased signal-to-noise ratio. One group of subjects (n=21) performed an  abstract and a verbal version of an n-back task contrasting a 2-back and 0-back  condition. Another group of subjects (n=23) performed an abstract and a verbal  version of a Sternberg task contrasting a high load and a low load condition. A  block design was used. For image processing of the dentate nuclei, a recently  developed region of interest (ROI) driven normalization method of the dentate nuclei  was applied (Diedrichsen et al., 2011). Whereas activated areas of the cerebellar  cortex and dentate nuclei were not significantly different comparing the abstract  and verbal versions of the n-back task, activation in the abstract and verbal  Sternberg tasks was significantly different. In both n-back tasks activation was  most prominent at the border of lobules VI and Crus I, within lobule VII, and within  the more caudal parts of the dentate nucleus bilaterally. In Sternberg tasks the  most prominent activations were found in lobule VI extending into Crus I on the  right. In the verbal Sternberg task activation was significantly larger within right  lobule VI compared to the abstract Sternberg task and compared to the verbal n-back  task. Activations of rostral parts of the dentate were most prominent in the verbal  Sternberg task, whereas activation of caudal parts predominated in the abstract  Sternberg task. On the one hand, the lack of difference between abstract and verbal  n-back tasks and the lack of significant lateralization suggest a more general  contribution of the cerebellum to working memory regardless of the modality. On the  other hand, the focus of activation in right lobule VI in the verbal Sternberg task  suggests specific cerebellar contributions to verbal working memory. The verbal  Sternberg task emphasizes maintenance of stimuli via phonological rehearsal, whereas  central executive demands prevail in n-back tasks. Based on the model of working  memory by Baddeley and Hitch (1974), the present results show that different regions  of the cerebellum support functions of the central executive system and one of the  subsidiary systems, the phonological loop.","2012-09","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1537-1550","","3","62","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this  explorative study was to investigate sex-dependent differences in prefrontal cortex  (PFC) functioning during a working memory (WM) functional magnetic resonance imaging  (fMRI) task in regular cocaine users (CUs), as PFC deficits are implicated in the  shift from recreational cocaine use to CUD. Neural activation was measured using  fMRI during a standard WM task (n-back task) in 27 male and 28 female CUs and in 26  male and 28 female non-cocaine users (non-CUs). Although there were no main or  interaction effects of sex and group on n-back task performance, WM-related  (2-back > 0-back) PFC functioning was significantly moderated by sex and group:  female compared with male CUs displayed higher WM-related activation of the middle  frontal gyrus (MFG), whereas female compared with male non-CUs displayed lower  WM-related MFG activation. Additionally, WM-related activation of the inferior  frontal gyrus, insula, and putamen was negatively associated with cocaine use  severity in female but not male CUs. These data support the hypothesis of  sex-dependent PFC differences in CUs and speculatively suggest that PFC deficits may  be more strongly implicated in the development, continuation, and possibly treatment  of CUD in females. Most importantly, the current data stress the importance of  studying both males and females in psychiatry research as not doing so could greatly  bias our knowledge of CUD and other psychiatric disorders.","2021-09","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","e13003","","5","26","","Addict Biol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 The Authors.

METHODS: Eighteen non-NPSLE  patients and 18 matched subjects were all tested using the Montreal cognitive  assessment scale test and scanned using blood-oxygen-level dependent fMRI while  performing the n-back task to investigate the activation intensity of some  cognition-related areas. RESULTS: Ethology results showed that non-NPSLE patients  had mild cognitive dysfunction and memory dysfunction (p < 0.05). The fMRI scan  confirmed a neural network consisting of bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  (DLPFC), premotor area, parietal lobe, and supplementary motor area (SMA)/anterior  cingulate cortex (ACC) that was activated during the n-back task, with right  hemisphere dominance. However, only the right SMA/ACC showed a load effect in the  non-NPSLE group; the activation intensity of most WM-related brain areas for the  non-NPSLE group was lower than for the control group under 3 memory loads. Further,  we found that the activation intensity of some cognition-related areas, including  the bilateral caudate nucleus/insula and hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus were  lower than the control group under the memory loads. An inverse correlation existed  between individual activation intensity and disease duration. CONCLUSION:  Non-NPSLE-related brain damage with right DLPFC-posterior parietal lobe and  parahippocampal gyrus default network causes impairment of spatial WM and mild  cognitive dysfunction.

OBJECTIVES: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to  compare pathophysiological changes in brain function between solvent-exposed and  control workers. METHODS: Painters, drywall tapers, and carpenters were recruited  from the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, District Council 9 in  New York City and District Council 21 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and from the  Carpenters Union in New Jersey. Twenty-seven solvent-exposed and 27 control subjects  of similar age, education, and occupational status completed the N-Back working  memory test during fMRI. After controlling for confounders (age; lifetime marijuana,  cocaine, and alcohol use; blood lead; symptoms of depression; verbal intelligence),  voxelwise group analysis and regional activation levels were compared and then  correlated with an index of lifetime solvent exposure. RESULTS: Solvent-exposed  workers' performance on the N-Back was significantly worse than that of controls.  Activation of the anterior cingulate, prefrontal, and parietal cortices--areas  serving working memory function and attention--was also significantly lower for  solvent-exposed workers relative to controls. After controlling for confounders, we  observed a negative correlation between lifetime solvent exposure and activation in  these same regions among the solvent-exposed workers. CONCLUSIONS: This study is one  of the few to document neural structures affected by exposure to solvents. Our  findings provide a biological mechanism for the neurobehavioral deficits in working  memory and attention that have previously been reported by other groups studying the  effects of chronic exposure to solvents. These imaging markers, which are consistent  with the neurobehavioral measures in our subject population, are consistent with  altered brain pathology caused by prolonged exposure to solvent mixtures during  construction work.","2011-07","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","908-913","","7","119","","Environ Health Perspect","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 21296712  PMCID: PMC3222975","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\URBBNEHR\Tang et al. - 2011 - Occupational solvent exposure and brain function .pdf","","Humans; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain/*physiopathology; Memory, Short-Term; Attention; *Occupational Exposure; Brain Diseases/chemically induced/diagnosis/epidemiology/*physiopathology; Memory Disorders/chemically induced/diagnosis/epidemiology/*physiopathology; New Jersey/epidemiology; New York City/epidemiology; Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/diagnosis/epidemiology/*physiopathology; Philadelphia/epidemiology; Solvents/*adverse effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present a novel application of multivariate Partial Least Squares  (PLS) analysis that permitted the simultaneous modeling of relations between WM  integrity values from all major WM tracts and patterns of condition-related BOLD  signal across all GM regions. Our results indicate that greater microstructural  integrity of the major WM tracts was negatively related to condition-related blood  oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal in task-positive GM regions. This negative  relationship suggests that better quality of structural connections allows for more  efficient use of task-related GM processing resources. Individuals with more intact  WM further showed greater BOLD signal increases in typical ""task-negative"" regions  during fixation, and notably exhibited a balanced magnitude of BOLD response across  task-positive and -negative states. Structure-function relations also predicted task  performance, including accuracy and speed of responding.

A  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was performed to explore working  memory function in ALS. METHODS: To contribute to the growing research field that  employs structural and functional neuroimaging to investigate the effect of ALS on  different working memory components, the localization and intensity of alterations  in neural activity was explored using fMRI. Being the first study to specifically  address verbal working memory via fMRI in the context of ALS, the verbal n-back task  with 0-back and 2-back conditions was employed. RESULTS: Despite ALS patients  showing unimpaired accuracies (p = 0.724) and reaction times (p = 0.0785), there was  significantly increased brain activity of frontotemporal and parietal regions in the  2-back minus 0-back contrast in patients compared to controls (using nonparametric  statistics with 5000 permutations and a T threshold of 2.5). DISCUSSION: Increased  brain activity of the frontotemporal and parietal regions during working memory  performance was largely associated with better neuropsychological function within  the ALS group, suggesting a compensatory effect during working memory execution.  This study therefore adds to the current knowledge on neural correlates of working  memory in ALS and contributes to a more nuanced understanding of hyperactivity  during cognitive processes in fMRI studies of ALS.","2021-09","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","3051-3060","","9","28","","Eur J Neurol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 The Authors.

METHODS: We  compared neural responses during hot and cold cognitive tasks in 99 individuals:  those at familial risk for depression (N = 30 unaffected first-degree relatives of  depressed individuals) and those currently experiencing a major depressive episode  (N = 39 unmedicated depressed patients) with low-risk healthy controls (N = 30).  Primary analyses assessed neural activation on two functional magnetic resonance  imaging tasks previously associated with depression: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  (DLPFC) responsivity during the n-back working memory task; and amygdala and  subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) responsivity during incidental emotional  face processing. RESULTS: Depressed patients exhibited significantly attenuated  working memory-related DLPFC activation, compared to low-risk controls and  unaffected relatives; unaffected relatives did not differ from low-risk controls. We  did not observe a complementary pattern during emotion processing. However, we found  preliminary support that greater DLPFC activation was associated with lower amygdala  response during emotion processing. LIMITATIONS: These findings require confirmation  in a longitudinal study to observe each individual's risk of developing depression;  without this, we cannot identify the true risk level of the first-degree relative or  low-risk control group. CONCLUSIONS: These findings have implications for  understanding the neural mechanisms of risk and resilience in depression: they are  consistent with the suggestion that preserved executive function might confer  resilience to developing depression in first-degree relatives of depressed patients.","2020-09-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","389-398","","","274","","J Affect Disord","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

The current study investigated the brain responses  of WM in a group of participants with mild-moderate TBI compared to their healthy  counterparts employing functional magnetic resonance imaging. All consented  participants (healthy: n = 26 and TBI: n = 15) performed two variations of the  n-back WM task with four load conditions (0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-back). The respective  within-group effects showed a right hemisphere-dominance activation and slower  reaction in performance for the TBI group. Random-effects analysis revealed  activation difference between the two groups in the right occipital lobe in the  guided n-back with cues, and in the bilateral occipital lobe, superior parietal  region, and cingulate cortices in the n-back without cues. The left middle frontal  gyrus was implicated in the load-dependent processing of WM in both groups. Further  group analysis identified that the notable activation changes in the frontal gyri  and anterior cingulate cortex are according to low and high loads.

At the very least, diagnostic markers should be able to  differentiate patients with BD from healthy individuals and from individuals at  familial risk for BD who either remain well or develop other psychopathology, most  commonly Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). These issues are particularly pertinent to  the development of translational applications of neuroimaging as they represent  challenges for which clinical observation alone is insufficient. We therefore  applied pattern classification to task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging  (fMRI) data of the n-back working memory task, to test their predictive value in  differentiating patients with BD (n=30) from healthy individuals (n=30) and from  patients' relatives who were either diagnosed with MDD (n=30) or were free of any  personal lifetime history of psychopathology (n=30). Diagnostic stability in these  groups was confirmed with 4-year prospective follow-up. Task-based activation  patterns from the fMRI data were analyzed with Gaussian Process Classifiers (GPC), a  machine learning approach to detecting multivariate patterns in neuroimaging  datasets. Consistent significant classification results were only obtained using  data from the 3-back versus 0-back contrast. Using contrast, patients with BD were  correctly classified compared to unrelated healthy individuals with an accuracy of  83.5%, sensitivity of 84.6% and specificity of 92.3%. Classification accuracy,  sensitivity and specificity when comparing patients with BD to their relatives with  MDD, were respectively 73.1%, 53.9% and 94.5%. Classification accuracy, sensitivity  and specificity when comparing patients with BD to their healthy relatives were  respectively 81.8%, 72.7% and 90.9%. We show that significant individual  classification can be achieved using whole brain pattern analysis of task-based  working memory fMRI data. The high accuracy and specificity achieved by all three  classifiers suggest that multivariate pattern recognition analyses can aid  clinicians in the clinical care of BD in situations of true clinical uncertainty  regarding the diagnosis and prognosis.","2017-01-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","230-237","","Pt B","145","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

Schizophrenia with OCD  (""schizo-obsessive"") patients are characterized by distinct clinical  characteristics, treatment response and prognosis. Whether schizo-obsessive patients  exhibit a distinct pattern of brain activation is yet unknown. To address this  question, the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study explicitly  compared alterations in brain activation and functional connectivity (FC) underlying  a working memory deficit in schizophrenia patients with and without OCD. METHODS:  fMRI was applied during the N-back working memory (WM) task in three groups:  schizo-obsessive (n=16), schizophrenia (n=17) and matched healthy volunteers (n=20).  WM-related activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the  right caudate nucleus, brain areas relevant to schizophrenia and OCD, and FC  analysis were used for the evaluation. RESULTS: The two schizophrenia groups with  and without OCD exhibited a similar reduction in activation in the right DLPFC and  right caudate, as well as decreased FC compared to the healthy controls. Notably,  reduced regional brain activation was not related to severity of schizophrenic or  OCD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Schizo-obsessive patients do not differ from their  non-OCD schizophrenia counterparts in brain activation patterns during the N-back WM  task. Cognitive paradigms taping alternative neural networks (e.g., orbitofrontal  cortex) particularly relevant to OCD, are warranted in the search for potential  distinctive brain activation patterns of the schizo-obsessive subgroup.","2014-03","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","160-166","","3","29","","Eur Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Oxytocin is a hypothalamic neuropeptide that has demonstrated  promise in modulating neurobiological and behavioral correlates of PTSD. Cognitive  deficits in areas such as working memory and executive control are highly prevalent  among individuals with PTSD and oxytocin might modulate these impairments in  individuals with PTSD. Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, this study  employed functional MRI (fMRI) and the n-back working memory task to examine the  effects of oxytocin (24 IU) versus placebo on working memory and dorsolateral  prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) connectivity among individuals with PTSD (n = 16) as  compared with a trauma-exposed control group (n = 18). Results indicate that  individuals with PTSD on oxytocin performed better in the 2-back condition of the  n-back task compared with individuals with PTSD on placebo. Results also indicate  that connectivity between DLPFC and anterior cingulate increased in the 2-back  condition among individuals with PTSD on oxytocin as compared with placebo. These  findings provide preliminary evidence of an effect of oxytocin on working memory  among individuals with PTSD and insights into the neurobiological mechanisms  underlying this association. Future studies are necessary to understand the  mechanisms responsible for working memory deficits in PTSD and to examine the  potential of oxytocin for use as a treatment for PTSD.

Despite the frequent co-occurrence of  these conditions, cognitive neuroscience studies examining comorbid depression and  anxiety are limited. The goal of the present study was to examine the unique and  combined effect of depressive and anxiety symptoms on cognitive and brain  functioning in young and older adults. METHODS: Seventy-one healthy,  community-dwelling adults between the ages of 18 and 81 were administered a  neuropsychological battery and completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies  Depression Scale (CES-D) and the trait form of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory  (STAI-T). A subset of 25 participants also underwent functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI) scanning while completing the n-back working memory task. RESULTS:  Total depressive symptoms, depressed mood symptoms, and somatic symptoms were  associated with deficits in speed, working memory and executive functions,  especially in older adults. Symptoms of lack of well-being were not associated with  any neuropsychological test. Anxiety was associated with better attention and  working memory. Moreover, anxiety modified the relationship between depressive  symptoms and executive functioning in older adults, as elevated depressive symptoms  were associated with worse performance at low levels of anxiety, but not at higher  anxiety levels. Similarly, analysis of fMRI data showed that total depressive  symptoms and depressed mood symptoms were associated with decreased activity in the  superior frontal gyrus at low anxiety levels, but not at high anxiety levels.  CONCLUSION: Results confirm previous reports that subthreshold depression and  anxiety impact cognitive and brain functioning and suggest that the interaction of  depression and anxiety results in distinct cognitive and brain changes.

Two WM  processes can be distinguished: maintenance (i.e., storing, monitoring, and matching  information) and manipulation (i.e., reordering and updating information). A number  of studies have reported an age-related decline in WM, but the mechanisms underlying  this deterioration need to be investigated. Previous research, including studies  conducted in our laboratory, revealed that age-related cognitive deficits are  related to decreased millisecond timing, i.e., the ability to perceive and organize  incoming events in time. The aim of the current study was: (1) to identify in the  elderly the brain network involved in the maintenance and manipulation WM processes;  and (2) to use an fMRI task to investigate the relation between the brain activity  associated with these two processes and the efficiency of temporal information  processing (TIP) on a millisecond level reflected by psychophysical indices.  Subjects were 41 normal healthy elderly people aged from 62 to 78 years. They  performed: (1) an auditory verbal n-back task for assessing WM efficiency in an MRI  scanner; and (2) a psychophysical auditory temporal-order judgment (TOJ) task for  assessing temporal resolution in the millisecond domain outside the scanner. The  n-back task comprised three conditions (0-, 1-, and 2-back), which allowed  maintenance (1- vs. 0-back comparisons) and manipulation (2- vs. 1-back comparisons)  processes to be distinguished. Results revealed the involvement of a similar brain  network in the elderly to that found in previous studies. However, during  maintenance processes, we found relatively limited and focused activations, which  were significantly extended during manipulation. A novel result of our study, never  reported before, is an indication of significant moderate correlations between the  efficiency of WM and TIP. These correlations were found only for manipulation but  not for maintenance. Our results confirmed the hypothesis that manipulation in the  elderly is a dynamic process requiring skilled millisecond timing with high temporal  resolution. We conclude that millisecond timing contributes to WM manipulation in  the elderly, but not to maintenance.","2020","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","194","","","12","","Front Aging Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Jablonska, Piotrowska, Bednarek, Szymaszek, Marchewka, Wypych and Szelag.","","","","","","PMID: 32848698  PMCID: PMC7396649","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\666QY2KH\Jablonska et al. - 2020 - Maintenance vs. Manipulation in Auditory Verbal Wo.pdf","","fMRI; working memory; auditory n-back task; maintenance and manipulation processes; temporal information processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Identifying biomarkers of preclinical cognitive decline is critical in the  development of preventative therapies, and peripheral inflammation may be able to  serve as an indicator of cognitive decline. However, little is known regarding the  relationship between peripheral inflammation and brain structure and function among  older adults. METHODS: Twenty-four older adults (mean age = 78) underwent a  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) resting state functional connectivity  scan, and a subset (n = 14) completed the n-Back working memory task in the scanner.  All participants completed a blood draw, and inflammation was measured with  interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP). RESULTS: Surprisingly, age was  unrelated to measures of inflammation (IL-6, CRP) or brain function (default mode  network (DMN) connectivity; working memory performance; blood oxygenation level  dependent (BOLD) activation with higher working memory load). However, lower  functional connectivity between the left parietal seed and all other DMN regions was  associated with higher levels of IL-6 and CRP. Additionally, greater plasma  concentration of IL-6 was associated with lower BOLD activation in the left middle  frontal gyrus in response to increased working memory load. CONCLUSIONS: These  preliminary findings support the importance of IL-6 and CRP in brain function among  older adults. Frontal and parietal regions may be particularly sensitive to the  effects of inflammation. Additionally, these findings provide preliminary evidence  of inflammatory contributions to level of neural activity, even after accounting for  vascular risk factors.","2017-03","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","341-349","","3","32","","Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","","","","","PMID: 27094339  PMCID: PMC5071119","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\J3LCMA8H\Dev et al. - 2017 - Peripheral inflammation related to lower fMRI acti.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Aged; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; *Brain Mapping; Memory, Short-Term/physiology; Cognition; functional MRI; Rest; *Cognitive Dysfunction; *Inflammation; *Parietal Lobe/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology; aging; C-Reactive Protein/analysis; cognitive health; Frontal Lobe; inflammation; Interleukin-6/blood; resting state connectivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this proof of concept study was to establish the nature of abnormalities,  in terms of activity and connectivity, in the working memory network of TBI patients  and how these relate to compromised behavioral outcomes. Further, this study  examined the neural correlates of working memory improvement following the  administration of methylphenidate. We report behavioral, functional and structural  MRI data from a group of 15 Healthy Controls (HC) and a group of 15 TBI patients,  acquired during the execution of the N-back task. The patients were studied on two  occasions after the administration of either placebo or 30 mg of methylphenidate.  Between group tests revealed a significant difference in performance when HCs were  compared to TBI patients on placebo [F((1, 28)) = 4.426, p < 0.05, η (p)(2) =  0.136]. This difference disappeared when the patients took methylphenidate [F((1,  28)) = 3.665, p = 0.66]. Patients in the middle range of baseline performance  demonstrated the most benefit from methylphenidate. Changes in the TBI patient  activation levels in the Left Cerebellum significantly and positively correlated  with changes in performance (r = 0.509, df = 13, p = 0.05). Whole-brain connectivity  analysis using the Left Cerebellum as a seed revealed widespread negative  interactions between the Left Cerebellum and parietal and frontal cortices as well  as subcortical areas. Neither the TBI group on methylphenidate nor the HC group  demonstrated any significant negative interactions. Our findings indicate that (a)  TBI significantly reduces the levels of activation and connectivity strength between  key areas of the working memory network and (b) Methylphenidate improves the  cognitive outcomes on a working memory task. Therefore, we conclude that  methylphenidate may render the working memory network in a TBI group more consistent  with that of an intact working memory network.","2017","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","58","","","11","","Front Behav Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 28424597  PMCID: PMC5380757","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\WSIK4RSB\Manktelow et al. - 2017 - Working Memory after Traumatic Brain Injury The N.pdf","","fMRI; working memory; functional connectivity; traumatic brain injury; cerebellum; cognitive function; methylphenidate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By including a multimodal dual-task component, the task is  demanding to the human cognitive system. We investigated whether dual n-back  training improves general cognitive resources or a task-specific WM updating process  in participants. We expected: (1) widespread transfer effects and the recruitment of  a common neuronal network by the training and the transfer tasks and (2) narrower  transfer results and that a common activation network alone would not produce  transfer, but instead an activation focus on the striatum, which is associated with  WM updating processes. The training group showed transfer to an untrained  dual-modality WM updating task, but not to single-task versions of the training or  the transfer task. They also showed diminished neuronal overlap between the training  and the transfer task from pretest to posttest and an increase in striatal  activation in both tasks. Furthermore, we found an association between the striatal  activation increase and behavioral improvement. The control groups showed no  transfer and no change in the amount of activation overlap or in striatal activation  from pretest to posttest. We conclude that, instead of improving general cognitive  resources (which would have required a transfer effect to all transfer tasks and  that a frontal activation overlap between the tasks produced transfer), dual n-back  training improved a task-specific process: WM updating of stimuli from two  modalities. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The current study allows for a better  understanding of the cognitive and neural effects of working memory (WM) training  and transfer. It shows that dual n-back training mainly improves specific processes  of WM updating, and this improvement leads to narrow transfer effects to tasks  involving the same processes. On a neuronal level this is accompanied by increased  neural activation in the striatum that is related to WM updating. The current  findings challenge the view that dual n-back training provokes a general boosting of  the WM system and of its neural underpinnings located in frontoparietal brain  regions. Instead, the findings imply the relevance of task-specific brain regions  which are involved in important cognitive processes during training and transfer  tasks.","2016-09-28","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","10198-10213","","39","36","","J Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 the authors 0270-6474/16/3610198-16$15.00/0.","","","","","","PMID: 27683914  PMCID: PMC6705577","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\28F9KUMX\Salminen et al. - 2016 - Transfer after Dual n-Back Training Depends on Str.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Young Adult; Cognition/physiology; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; *fMRI; *working memory; Task Performance and Analysis; Neuronal Plasticity/*physiology; Nerve Net/*physiology; Executive Function/physiology; Attention/physiology; *dual n-back; *Practice, Psychological; *training; *transfer; Adaptation, Physiological/physiology; Auditory Perception; Conditioning, Psychological/physiology; Corpus Striatum/*physiology; Transfer, Psychology/*physiology; Visual Perception","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Theoretical models of neural-cognitive relationships define  neural efficiency and neural capacity as two parameters to describe the rate of gain  of brain activity and the upper limits of the increases, respectively. Although  qualitatively well described, there are limited discussions and demonstrations of  estimating these parameters from data. The current work presents a method using a  quadratic equation model of cognitive demands. The methods were applied to 21  healthy young adults while engaging in four levels of the verbal n-back working  memory task (0, 1, 2 and 3-back). Measures of the area under the curve captured both  linear and curvilinear responses to quantify the locations and amounts of  task-related increases in brain activity. In addition, we calculated voxel-wise maps  of neural efficiency and neural capacity. Results showed increases in brain  activation in regions typically involved in working memory. The relationships  between increasing cognitive demands and brain activity also differed across the  brain within and between individuals, as indicated by differential neural efficiency  and neural capacity values. This approach provides tools for evaluating current  theories about the relationships between brain activity and cognition. Neural  efficiency and neural capacity provide physiological measures of brain activity,  which will help evaluate how age, disease and intervention processes affect brain  activity. Finally, all presented methods are readily applicable using standard  current software packages for neuroimaging.","2021-11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","7176-7192","","9","54","","Eur J Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 34555233","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\N3JK9YTF\Steffener et al. - 2021 - Quantifying neural efficiency and neural capacity .pdf","","Humans; Young Adult; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; *fMRI; *working memory; *n-back; *Memory, Short-Term; Cognition; *Brain/diagnostic imaging; *neural capacity; *neural efficiency; *quadratic polynomial","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we studied the test-retest reliability of brain graphs  calculated from 26 healthy participants with three established fMRI experiments  (n-back working memory, emotional face-matching, resting state) and two parcellation  schemes for node definition (AAL atlas, functional atlas proposed by Power et al.).  We compared the intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) of five different data  processing strategies and demonstrated a superior reliability of task-regression  methods with condition-specific regressors. The between-task comparison revealed  significantly higher ICCs for resting state relative to the active tasks, and a  superiority of the n-back task relative to the face-matching task for global and  local network properties. While the mean ICCs were typically lower for the active  tasks, overall fair to good reliabilities were detected for global and local  connectivity properties, and for the n-back task with both atlases, smallworldness.  For all three tasks and atlases, low mean ICCs were seen for the local network  properties. However, node-specific good reliabilities were detected for node degree  in regions known to be critical for the challenged functions (resting-state:  default-mode network nodes, n-back: fronto-parietal nodes, face-matching: limbic  nodes). Between-atlas comparison demonstrated significantly higher reliabilities for  the functional parcellations for global and local network properties.

Moreover, some studies have investigated the possible neural changes during the  performance of untrained tasks after training. Here, we studied the transfer from  n-back training to the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), two different  tasks that use the central executive system to maintain verbal stimuli. Participants  completed fMRI sessions at baseline, immediately after one week of training, and at  the five-week follow-up. Although behavioral transfer effects were not obtained,  training was associated with decreased activation in the anterior dorsolateral  prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; BA 9/46) while performing the PASAT that remained stable  five weeks later. Consistent with our hypothesis, the changes in the anterior DLFPC  largely overlapped with the n-back task fMRI activations. In conclusion, working  memory training improves efficiency in brain areas involved in the trained task that  may affect untrained tasks, specifically in brain areas responsible for the same  cognitive processes.","2020-03-23","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","5226","","1","10","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 32251354  PMCID: PMC7089996","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\PSQDXPVI\Miró-Padilla et al. - 2020 - Locating neural transfer effects of n-back trainin.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Young Adult; Neuropsychological Tests; Reaction Time; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Memory, Short-Term/physiology; Longitudinal Studies; Neurons; Nontherapeutic Human Experimentation; Prefrontal Cortex/diagnostic imaging/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Working memory deficits are present in several psychiatric  disorders, and there is wide variation in working memory capacity in the normal  population. Association studies of COMT and working memory in healthy volunteers  have yielded inconsistent results, possibly because of small sample sizes. Here we  examine COMT in relation to N-Back working memory task performance in a large  population-based cohort of young adults. We predicted individuals with one or two  copies of the Met allele would perform better, and that this relationship would be  more evident in males than females. Participants (N=1857-2659) tested at 18 years of  age, were enrolled in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC).  We used multiple regression to examine effects of sex and COMT genotype on N-Back  hits, false positives, discriminability (d'), and reaction time while controlling  for important covariates. COMT genotype did not predict hits or d'. There was a  nominally significant interaction between COMT and sex on false positives, but this  was not in the predicted direction, and was not significant after controlling for  covariates. COMT genotype was not related to working memory in this large  population-based cohort. It is possible COMT is not meaningfully associated with  working memory in healthy young adults, or that COMT effects are detectable only in  assessments reflecting neural processes underlying cognition, such as fMRI, rather  than in behavioral performance.","2013-06","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1253-1263","","7","38","","Neuropsychopharmacology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 23337869  PMCID: PMC3656369","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\2NDKPZF4\Wardle et al. - 2013 - Lack of association between COMT and working memor.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Alleles; Genotype; Adolescent; Cohort Studies; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Psychomotor Performance/physiology; Sex Characteristics; *Genetic Association Studies; Catechol O-Methyltransferase/genetics/*physiology; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/physiology; Reaction Time/genetics; Signal Detection, Psychological/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, the type and severity of neonatal brain injury associated with very  preterm birth may exert differential effects on executive functioning by altering  its neuroanatomical substrates. Here we addressed this question by investigating  with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) the haemodynamic response during  executive-type processing using a phonological verbal fluency and a working memory  task in VPT-born young adults who had experienced differing degrees of neonatal  brain injury. 12 VPT individuals with a history of periventricular haemorrhage and  ventricular dilatation (PVH+VD), 17 VPT individuals with a history of uncomplicated  periventricular haemorrhage (UPVH), 13 VPT individuals with no history of neonatal  brain injury and 17 controls received an MRI scan whilst completing a verbal fluency  task with two cognitive loads ('easy' and 'hard' letters). Two groups of VPT  individuals (PVH+VD; n = 10, UPVH; n = 8) performed an n-back task with three  cognitive loads (1-, 2-, 3-back). Results demonstrated that VPT individuals  displayed hyperactivation in frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices and in caudate  nucleus, insula and thalamus compared to controls, as demands of the verbal fluency  task increased, regardless of type of neonatal brain injury. On the other hand,  during the n-back task and as working memory load increased, the PVH+VD group showed  less engagement of the frontal cortex than the UPVH group. In conclusion, this study  suggests that the functional neuroanatomy of different executive-type processes is  altered following VPT birth and that neural activation associated with specific  aspects of executive function (i.e., working memory) may be particularly sensitive  to the extent of neonatal brain injury.","2014","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","e113975","","12","9","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 25438043  PMCID: PMC4250191","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\E7PPFL83\Kalpakidou et al. - 2014 - Functional neuroanatomy of executive function afte.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Young Adult; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain/*physiopathology; Memory, Short-Term; *Executive Function; Brain Injuries/*physiopathology; Infant, Extremely Premature/*growth & development; Verbal Behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several lines of evidence suggest that estrogen may  produce its effects on cognition and mood through modulation of serotonergic  function. To test this hypothesis, we used the tryptophan depletion (TD) paradigm to  lower central serotonin levels and pharmacologically manipulated estrogen levels in  healthy menopausal women. We examined the individual and combined effects of  estradiol and serotonin on working memory, emotion processing and task-related brain  activation. Eight healthy predominantly early postmenopausal women underwent TD or  sham depletion followed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) both before  and after short-term transdermal estradiol 75-150 μg/d administration. There was an  estradiol treatment by TD interaction for brain activation during performance on  both the N-back Task (working memory) and Emotion Identification Task (affective  processing). During the 2-back condition, TD attenuated activation prior to, but not  after, estradiol treatment in the right and left dorsal lateral prefrontal and  middle frontal/cingulate gyrus. During emotion identification, TD heightened  activation in the orbital frontal cortex and bilateral amygdala, and this effect was  attenuated by estradiol treatment. These results provide preliminary evidence that  serotonergic effects directly mediate the impact of estrogen on brain activation  during working memory and affective processing.","2012-03","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","372-382","","3","37","","Psychoneuroendocrinology","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, there  were no significant differences in grey matter volume changes between groups.  Significant correlations between brain activations and both clinical severity and  age at disease onset were observed in FRDA individuals only at 24 months.

The current  study directly tests this hypothesis in the context of practice of a working memory  task. It was hypothesized that individuals with brain injury would demonstrate  recruitment of previously indicated regions, behavioral improvement following task  practice, and a reduction in the BOLD signal in recruited regions after practice.  Individuals with traumatic brain injury and healthy controls performed the n-back  during fMRI acquisition, practiced each task out of the scanner, and returned to the  scanner for additional fMRI n-back acquisition. Statistical parametric maps  demonstrated a number of regions of recruitment in the 1-back in individuals with  brain injury and a number of corresponding regions of reduced activation in  individuals with brain injury following practice in both the 1-back and 2-back.  Regions of interest demonstrated reduced activation following practice, including  the anterior cingulate and right prefrontal cortices. Individuals with brain injury  demonstrated modest behavioral improvements following practice. These findings  suggest that neural recruitment in brain injury does not represent reorganization  but a natural extension of latent mechanisms that engage transiently and are  contingent upon cerebral challenge.","2012-04","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","979-993","","4","33","","Hum Brain Mapp","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","","","","PMID: 21591026  PMCID: PMC6870270","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\TEF86TLB\Medaglia et al. - 2012 - The less BOLD, the wiser support for the latent r.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; *Brain Mapping; Memory, Short-Term/physiology; Cerebral Cortex/*physiology; Neuronal Plasticity/*physiology; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Brain Injuries/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An important circuit-level feature derived from functional magnetic  resonance imaging (fMRI) is prefrontal-hippocampal seeded connectivity during  working memory, the best established intermediate connectivity phenotype of  schizophrenia risk to date. The phenotype is a promising marker for the effects of  plasticity-enhancing interventions, such as high-frequency repetitive transcranial  magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and can be studied in healthy volunteers in the absence  of illness-related confounds, but the relationship to brain plasticity is  unexplored. We recruited 39 healthy volunteers to investigate the effects of 5 Hz  rTMS on prefrontal-hippocampal coupling during working memory and rest. In a  randomized and sham-controlled experiment, neuronavigation-guided rTMS was applied  to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and fMRI and functional  connectivity analyses [seeded connectivity and psychophysiological interaction  (PPI)] were used as readouts. Moreover, the test-retest reliability of  working-memory related connectivity markers was evaluated. rTMS provoked a  significant decrease in seeded functional connectivity of the right DLPFC and left  hippocampus during working memory that proved to be relatively time-invariant and  robust. PPI analyses provided evidence for a nominal effect of rTMS and poor  test-retest reliability. No effects on n-back-related activation and  DLPFC-hippocampus resting-state connectivity were observed. These data provide the  first in vivo evidence for the effects of plasticity induction on human  prefrontal-hippocampal network dynamics, offer insights into the biological  mechanisms of a well established intermediate phenotype linked to schizophrenia, and  underscores the importance of the choice of outcome measures in test-retest designs.","2013-04-17","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","7050-7056","","16","33","","J Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 23595762  PMCID: PMC6618883","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\MXHU2737\Bilek et al. - 2013 - Application of high-frequency repetitive transcran.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Young Adult; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; *Brain Mapping; Oxygen/blood; Memory, Short-Term/physiology; Analysis of Variance; Reproducibility of Results; Hippocampus/blood supply/*physiology; Neural Pathways/blood supply/physiology; Prefrontal Cortex/blood supply/*physiology; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, polygenic risk was  associated with lower levels of brain activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus  during the 3-back compared to a 2-back condition. Polygenic risk leads to a shift in  the underlying activation pattern to the left side, thus resembling results reported  in patients with schizophrenia.

Training resulted in an activity decrease in regions known to be involved in verbal  WM (i.e., fronto-parieto-cerebellar circuitry and subcortical regions), indicating  that the brain became potentially more efficient after the training. These  activation decreases were associated with a significant performance improvement in  the n-back task inside the scanner reflecting considerable practice effects. In  addition, there were training-associated direct effects in the additional, external  verbal WM task (i.e., HAWIE-R digit span forward task), and indicating that the  training generally improved performance in this cognitive domain.

Thus, we examine the impact of striatal iron  on dynamic range of BOLD modulation to working memory load. N ​= ​166 healthy adults  (age 20-94) underwent cognitive testing and an imaging session including n-back (0-,  2-, 3-, and 4-back fMRI), R2*-weighted imaging, and pcASL to measure cerebral blood  flow. A statistical model was constructed to predict voxelwise BOLD modulation by  age, striatal iron content and an age ​× ​iron interaction, controlling for cerebral  blood flow, sex, and task response time. A significant interaction between age and  striatal iron content on BOLD modulation was found selectively in the putamen,  caudate, and inferior frontal gyrus. Greater iron was associated with reduced  modulation to difficulty, particularly in middle-aged and younger adults with  greater iron content. Further, iron-related decreases in modulation were associated  with poorer executive function in an age-dependent manner. These results suggest  that iron may contribute to differences in functional brain activation prior to  older adulthood, highlighting the potential role of iron as an early factor  contributing to trajectories of functional brain aging.","2020-04-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","116544","","","210","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

We investigated changes in both  the large-scale modular organization of the functional brain network as a whole and  regional changes in modular organization as demands on working memory increased from  n = 1 to n = 2 on the standard n-back task. We further investigated the relationship  between modular properties across working memory load conditions and behavioral  performance. Our results showed that regional modular organization within the  default mode and working memory circuits significantly changed from 1-back to 2-back  task conditions. However, the regional modular organization was not associated with  behavioral performance. Global measures of modular organization did not change with  working memory load but were associated with individual variability in behavioral  performance. These findings indicate that regional and global network properties are  modulated by different aspects of working memory under increasing load conditions.  These findings highlight the importance of assessing multiple features of functional  brain network topology at both global and regional scales rather than focusing on a  single network property.","2014","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","954","","","8","","Front Hum Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 25520639  PMCID: PMC4249452","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\6UBI79YZ\Stanley et al. - 2014 - Changes in global and regional modularity associat.pdf","","fMRI; working memory; n-back; complex network; graph theory; modularity; working memory load","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Erythropoietin (EPO) is a candidate treatment for cognitive  impairment in unipolar and bipolar disorders (UD and BD) and modulates  cognition-related neural activity across a fronto-temporo-parietal network. This  report investigates predicting the pharmacological treatment from functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data using a supervised machine learning approach.  A total of 84 patients with UD or BD were included in a randomized double-blind  parallel-group study in which they received eight weekly infusions of either EPO (40  000 IU) or saline. Task fMRI data were collected before EPO/saline infusions started  (baseline) and 6 weeks after last infusion (follow-up). During the scanning  sessions, participants were given an n-back working memory and a picture encoding  task. Linear classification models with different regularization techniques were  used to predict treatment status from both cross-sectional data (at follow-up) and  longitudinal data (difference between baseline and follow-up). For the n-back and  picture encoding tasks, data were available and analyzed for 52 (EPO; n = 28,  Saline; n = 24) and 59 patients (EPO; n = 31, Saline; n = 28), respectively. We  found limited evidence that the classifiers used could predict treatment status at a  reliable level of performance (≤60% accuracy) when tested using repeated  cross-validation. There was no difference in using cross-sectional versus  longitudinal data. Whole-brain multivariate decoding applied to pharmaco-fMRI in  small to moderate samples seems to be suboptimal for exploring data driven neuronal  treatment mechanisms.","2019","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1246","","","13","","Front Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 Nielsen, Madsen, Vinberg, Kessing, Siebner and Miskowiak.","","","","","","PMID: 31824247  PMCID: PMC6880626","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\XCQK6FVW\Nielsen et al. - 2019 - Whole-Brain Exploratory Analysis of Functional Tas.pdf","","functional magnetic resonance imaging; cognitive dysfunction; erythropoietin; machine learning; mood disorders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since patients with attention  deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are characterized by both underactivation of  the prefrontal cortex and deficits in WM, the modulation of prefrontal activity with  tDCS in ADHD patients may increase their WM performance as well as improve the  activation and connectivity of the WM network. In the present study, this hypothesis  was tested using a double-blind sham-controlled experimental design. After  randomization, sixteen adolescents with ADHD underwent either anodal tDCS over the  left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, 1 mA, 20 min) or sham stimulation with  simultaneous fMRI during n-back WM task. Both in one-back and two-back conditions,  tDCS led to a greater activation (compared with sham stimulation) of the left DLPFC  (under the electrode), left premotor cortex, left supplementary motor cortex, and  precuneus. The effects of tDCS were long-lasting and influenced resting state  functional connectivity even 20 min after the stimulation, with patterns of  strengthened DLPFC connectivity after tDCS outlining the WM network. In summary,  anodal tDCS caused increased neuronal activation and connectivity, not only in the  brain area under the stimulating electrode (i.e. left DLPFC) but also in other, more  remote brain regions. Because of moderate behavioral effects of tDCS, the  significance of this technique for ADHD treatment has to be investigated in further  studies.","2017-09","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","656-672","","5","30","","Brain Topogr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 28213645","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\34MPHDBR\Sotnikova et al. - 2017 - Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Modulates .pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Child; Adolescent; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; fMRI; Prefrontal Cortex/*physiopathology; Working memory; ADHD; Nerve Net/*physiopathology; Double-Blind Method; *Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/physiopathology/*therapy; Transcranial direct current stimulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We addressed this  issue by using functional MRI and a working memory paradigm to study familial and  clinical high-risk groups. We recruited 17 subjects at ultra-high-risk (UHR) for  psychosis, 10 non-affected siblings of patients with schizophrenia (familial high  risk [FHR]) and 15 healthy controls. Subjects were scanned while performing the  N-back working memory task. There was a relationship between the level of  task-related deactivation in the medial PFC and precuneus and the level of psychosis  risk, with deactivation weakest in the UHR group, greatest in healthy controls, and  at an intermediate level in the FHR group. In the high-risk groups, activation in  the precuneus was associated with the level of negative symptoms. These data suggest  that increased vulnerability to psychosis is associated with a failure to deactivate  in the medial PFC and precuneus during a working memory task, and appears to be most  evident in subjects at clinical, as opposed to familial high risk.","2015-07","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","633-640","","5","30","","Eur Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

WMT  claims to improve working memory, attention deficits, hyperactivity and fluid  intelligence, in line with plasticity brain changes. Critics argue that WMT is  unable to achieve ""far-transfer""-the attainment of benefits to cognition from one  taught context to another dissimilar context-associated with improved quality of  life. However, brain changes after a course of WMT in frontoparietal and striatal  circuits-that often occur prior to behavioral changes-may be a better indicator of  far-transfer efficacy, especially to improve impulse control commonly dysregulated  in those with addictive disorders, yet not commonly examined in WMT studies. METHOD:  In contrast to previous reviews, the aim here is to focus on the findings of brain  imaging WMT training studies across various imaging modalities that use various  paradigms, published via PubMed, Scopus, Medline, and Google Scholar. RESULTS: 35  brain imaging studies utilized fMRI, structural imaging (MRI, DTI), functional  connectivity, EEG, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), cerebral  perfusion, and neurogenetic analyses with tasks based on visuospatial and auditory  working memory, dual and standard n-back. DISCUSSION: Evidence suggests that  repeated WMT reduces brain activation in frontoparietal and striatal networks  reflective of increased neural circuitry efficiency via myelination and functional  connectivity changes. Neural effects of WMT may persist months after training has  ended, lead to non-trained task transfer, be strengthened by auxiliary methods such  as tDCS and be related to COMT polymorphisms. WMT could be utilized as an effective,  non-invasive intervention for working memory deficits to treat impulse and affective  control problems in people with addictive disorders.","2020","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","512761","","","11","","Front Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Brooks, Mackenzie-Phelan, Tully and Schiöth.","","","","","","PMID: 33132926  PMCID: PMC7511702","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\35UQKR3Z\Brooks et al. - 2020 - Review of the Neural Processes of Working Memory T.pdf","","n-back; working memory training; addiction; CogMed; frontoparietal; neuroplasticity; striatal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study examined how aging affects brain variability across cognitive  loads and the contribution of BOLD variability to working memory abilities.  Participants (N = 149, ages 20‒86) completed an fMRI n-back paradigm with 3 loads  and 10-minute resting state scan. We found that BOLD variability was greater during  rest compared to task and decreased even further as n-back load increased. Older age  was associated with smaller load-related modulations of BOLD variability in default  mode and fronto-parietal control networks.

The functional  connectivity between frontoparietal regions are modulated by working memory loads,  and are shown to be modulated by a third brain region in resting-state. However, it  is largely unknown whether the third-region modulations remain the same during  working memory tasks or were largely modulated by task demands. In the current  study, we collected functional MRI (fMRI) data when the subjects were performing  n-back tasks and in resting-state. We first used a block-designed localizer to  define the frontoparietal regions that showed higher activations in the 2-back than  the 1-back condition. Next, we performed physiophysiological interaction (PPI)  analysis using left and right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and superior parietal  lobule (SPL) regions, respectively, in three continuous-designed runs of  resting-state, 1-back, and 2-back conditions. No regions showed consistent  modulatory interactions with the seed pairs in the three conditions. Instead, the  anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) showed different modulatory interactions with the  right MFG and SPL among the three conditions. While the increased activity of the  ACC was associated with decreased functional coupling between the right MFG and SPL  in resting-state, it was associated with increased functional coupling in the 2-back  condition. The observed task modulations support the functional significance of the  modulations of the ACC on frontoparietal connectivity.","2020-05","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1797-1805","","7","41","","Hum Brain Mapp","","","","","","","","eng","© 2020 The Authors.

Its underlying neural mechanisms have been explored through both  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG).  Trial-by-trial coupling of simultaneously collected EEG and fMRI signals has become  an important and promising approach to study the spatio-temporal dynamics of such  cognitive processes. Previous studies have demonstrated a modulation effect of the  WM load on both the BOLD response in certain brain areas and the amplitude of P3.  However, much remains to be explored regarding the WM load-dependent relationship  between the amplitude of ERP components and cortical activities, and the low  signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the EEG signal still poses a challenge to performing  single-trial analyses. In this paper, we investigated the spatio-temporal activities  of P3 during an n-back verbal WM task by introducing an adaptive wavelet denoiser  into the extraction of single-trial P3 features and using general linear model (GLM)  to integrate simultaneously collected EEG and fMRI data. Our results replicated the  modulation effect of the WM load on the P3 amplitude. Additionally, the activation  of single-trial P3 amplitudes was detected in multiple brain regions, including the  insula, the cuneus, the lingual gyrus (LG), and the middle occipital gyrus (MOG).  Moreover, we found significant correlations between P3 features and behavioral  performance. These findings suggest that the single-trial integration of  simultaneous EEG and fMRI signals may provide new insights into classical cognitive  functions.","2017-03-27","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","64-73","","","346","","Neuroscience","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 IBRO.

Existing research probing task-related reconfiguration of brain  network structure has concluded that, although there are many similarities in  network structure during an intrinsic, resting state and during the performance of a  variety of cognitive tasks, there are meaningful differences as well. In this study,  we related intrinsic, resting state network organization to reconfigured network  organization during the performance of two tasks: a sequence tapping task, which is  thought to probe motor execution and likely engages a single brain network, and an  n-back task, which is thought to probe working memory and likely requires  coordination across multiple networks. We implemented graph theoretical analyses  using functional connectivity data from fMRI scans to calculate whole-brain measures  of network organization in healthy young adults. We focused on quantifying measures  of network segregation (modularity, system segregation, local efficiency, number of  provincial hub nodes) and measures of network integration (global efficiency, number  of connector hub nodes). Using these measures, we found converging evidence that  local, within-network communication is critical for motor execution, whereas  integrative, between-network communication is critical for working memory. These  results confirm that the human brain has the remarkable ability to reconfigure its  large-scale organization dynamically in response to current cognitive demands and  that interpreting reconfiguration in terms of network segregation and integration  may shed light on the optimal network structures underlying successful cognition.  SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The dynamic nature of the human brain gives rise to the wide  range of behaviors and cognition of which humans are capable. We collected fMRI data  from healthy young adults and measured large-scale functional connectivity patterns  between regions distributed across the entire brain. We implemented graph  theoretical analyses to quantify network organization during two tasks hypothesized  to require different combinations of brain networks. During motor execution,  segregation of distinct networks increased. Conversely, during working memory,  integration across networks increased. These changes in network organization were  related to better behavioral performance. These results underscore the human brain's  ability to reconfigure network organization selectively and adaptively when  confronted with changing cognitive demands to achieve an optimal balance between  segregation and integration.","2016-11-30","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","12083-12094","","48","36","","J Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 the authors 0270-6474/16/3612083-12$15.00/0.","","","","","","PMID: 27903719  PMCID: PMC5148214","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\K8VX3ZJH\Cohen and D'Esposito - 2016 - The Segregation and Integration of Distinct Brain .pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Models, Statistical; Computer Simulation; Brain Mapping; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Cognition/*physiology; Brain/*physiology; Psychomotor Performance/*physiology; *functional connectivity; *working memory; Nerve Net/*physiology; Neural Pathways/physiology; Executive Function/physiology; *graph theory; *individual differences; *Models, Neurological; *motor execution; *resting state","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The calculation of a  polygenic risk score (PRS) can be used to describe the genetic influence on MDD,  hence imaging genetic studies aspire to combine both genetics and neuroimaging data  to identify the influence of genetic factors on brain functioning. We aimed to  detect the effect of MDD-PRS on brain activation during a WM task measured with fMRI  and expect healthy individuals with a higher PRS to be more resembling to MDD  patients. METHOD: In total, n=137 (80 men, 57 women, aged 34.5, SD=10.4years)  healthy subjects performed a WM n-back task [0-back (baseline), 2-back and 3-back  condition] in a 3T-MRI-tomograph. The sample was genotyped using the Infinium  PsychArray BeadChip and a polygenic risk score was calculated for MDD using PGC MDD  GWAS results. RESULTS: A lower MDD risk score was associated with increased  activation in the bilateral middle occipital gyri (MOG), the bilateral middle  frontal gyri (MFG) and the right precentral gyrus (PCG) during the 2-back vs.  baseline condition. Moreover, a lower PRS was associated with increased brain  activation during the 3-back vs. baseline condition in the bilateral cerebellum, the  right MFG and the left inferior parietal lobule. A higher polygenic risk score was  associated with hyperactivation in brain regions comprising the right MFG and the  right supplementary motor area during the 3-back vs. 2-back condition. DISCUSSION:  The results suggest that part of the WM-related brain activation patterns might be  explained by genetic variants captured by the MDD-PRS. Furthermore we were able to  detect MDD-associated activation patterns in healthy individuals depending on the  MDD-PRS and the task complexity. Additional gene loci could contribute to these  task-dependent brain activation patterns.","2017-10-03","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","67-76","","Pt B","79","","Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS:  Eleven older adults with current MDD and 12 nondepressed comparison participants  (all aged 60 years and older) performed the N-back test of working memory during  fMRI. RESULTS: Depressed older adults performed worse than nondepressed participants  on the N-back task. Depressed older adults had decreased lateral frontal and  parietal activation during the most difficult working memory load condition on the  N-back compared with nondepressed older adults.

In  this combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)/pupillometry study, we  recorded the pupil size of healthy human participants while they performed a  blockwise organized working memory task (N-back) inside an MRI scanner in order to  monitor the pupil fluctuations associated neural activity during working memory  processing. We first confirmed that mean pupil size closely followed working memory  load. Combining this with fMRI data, we focused on blood oxygen level dependent  (BOLD) correlates of mean pupil size modeled onto the task blocks as a parametric  modulation. Interrogating this modulated task regressor, we were able to retrieve  the frontoparietal network. Next, to fully exploit the within-block dynamics, we  divided the blocks into 1 s time bins and filled these with corresponding pupil  change values (first-order derivative of pupil size). We found that pupil change  within N-back blocks was positively correlated with BOLD amplitudes in the areas of  the salience network (namely bilateral insula, and anterior cingulate cortex). Taken  together, fMRI with simultaneous measurement of pupil parameters constitutes a  valuable tool to dissect working memory subprocesses related to both working memory  load and salience of the presented stimuli.","2022-02-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","665-680","","2","43","","Hum Brain Mapp","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 The Authors.

Apolipoprotein E-ε4 carriers presented declined working-memory activation in the  high-memory load across whole brain regions and reduced hippocampal connectivity  compared with non-carriers. In addition, disrupted rest-stimulus interactions were  found in the right anterior insula and bilateral parahippocampal regions for  middle-aged adults with apolipoprotein E-ε4 allele.

Action-Based Cognitive Remediation (ABCR) improves executive function in  BD and this was accompanied by increased dorsal prefrontal cortex (dPFC) response  during working memory (WM) after two weeks of treatment. This study investigated  whether pre-treatment WM-related dPFC response, executive dysfunction and/or  subjective cognitive difficulties predicted ABCR treatment response on executive  functions. Forty-five patients with fully or partially remitted BD (ABCR: n = 25,  control treatment: n = 20) in our ABCR trial completed a spatial N-back WM task  during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at baseline. Patients also  completed neuropsychological tests and rated their cognitive functions before and  after 10 weeks of ABCR or control treatment. Multiple linear regression analyses  were conducted to assess whether pre-treatment dPFC response, objective executive  impairment and/or subjective cognitive difficulties predicted greater ABCR-related  improvements of executive function. We found that treatment-related improvement in  executive function was predicted by more WM-related dPFC hypo-activity at baseline  (p = 0.03) in linear regression analyses adjusted for age, gender and education. In  contrast, there was only a non-significant trend towards more executive dysfunction  at baseline predicting greater ABCR-related executive improvement (p = 0.08).  Subjective cognitive difficulties at baseline showed no association with treatment  effects (p = 0.16).

Here, the impact and neural underpinnings of pornographic  pictures on working memory processes in a sample of subjects with compulsive sexual  behaviour was investigated. Therefore, whilst using functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI), a letter n-back task with neutral or pornographic pictures in the  background was employed in 38 patients and 31 healthy controls. On the behavioural  level, patients were slowed down by pornographic material depending on their  pornography consumption in the last week, which was reflected by a higher activation  in the lingual gyrus. In addition, the lingual gyrus showed a higher functional  connectivity to the insula during processing of pornographic stimuli in the patient  group. In contrast, healthy subjects showed faster responses when confronted with  pornographic pictures only with high cognitive load. Also, patients showed a better  memory for pornographic pictures in a surprise recognition task compared to  controls, speaking for a higher relevance of pornographic material in the patient  group. These findings are in line with the incentive salience theory of addiction,  especially the higher functional connectivity to the salience network with the  insula as a key hub and the higher lingual activity during processing of  pornographic pictures depending on recent pornography consumption.","2020","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","102308","","","27","","Neuroimage Clin","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

METHODS: We applied a  sophisticated method, the structural equation modeling (SEM), to the fMRI data. The  imaging data were analyzed by extracting the task-related eigenseries using the  principal component analysis (PCA) and then by applying a form of data-driven model  called the automated search method. RESULTS: The SEM analyses revealed a functional  shift of network connectivity from the right to the left hemisphere with increasing  load in the face-matching n-back tasks while the location-matching tasks required  bilateral activation. In the locating matching n-back tasks, a pattern of parallel  processing was observed in the left phonological loop and the right inferior  parietal regions. Furthermore, object working memory-related activities in the left  hemisphere reliably contributed to performance of both the face- and  location-matching 2-back tasks. CONCLUSION: Our results are consistent with previous  reports in terms of demonstrating parallel and distributed information processing  during performing working memory tasks with heavy loads. Our results additionally  suggest a dynamic shift between the fast imagery circuit (right hemisphere) and the  stable verbal circuit (left hemisphere), depending on task load.","2012-09","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","283-292","","3","9","","Psychiatry Investig","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 22993529  PMCID: PMC3440479","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\YNM2VF49\Kim et al. - 2012 - Changes in effective connectivity according to wor.pdf","","Working memory; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Face matching; Location matching; Structural equation modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To confirm the specificity of E effects, we also  examined the effects of neuroticism and psychoticism (P) scores. We observed that,  as predicted by Eysenck's model, the higher the E score, the greater the change in  fMRI signal from rest to the 3-back condition in the DLPFC and AC. In addition, E  scores were negatively associated with resting fMRI signals in the thalamus and  Broca's area extending to Wernicke's area, supporting the hypothesized (negative)  relationship between E and resting arousal. P scores negatively correlated with  resting fMRI signal in the globus pallidus-putamen, extending previous findings of a  negative relationship of schizotypy to striatal activity seen with older  neuroimaging modalities to fMRI.

While fNIRS has gained  interest as a potential alternative to fMRI for use with clinical and pediatric  populations, it remains unclear whether fNIRS has the necessary sensitivity to serve  as a replacement for fMRI. The present study set out to examine whether fNIRS has  the sensitivity to detect linear changes in activation and functional connectivity  in response to cognitive load, and functional connectivity changes when  transitioning from a task-free resting state to a task. Sixteen young adult subjects  were scanned with a continuous-wave fNIRS system during a 10-min resting-state scan  followed by a letter n-back task with three load conditions. Five optical probes  were placed over frontal and parietal cortices, covering bilateral dorsolateral PFC  (dlPFC), bilateral ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC), frontopolar cortex (FP), and bilateral  parietal cortex. Activation was found to scale linearly with working memory load in  bilateral prefrontal cortex. Functional connectivity increased with increasing  n-back loads for fronto-parietal, interhemispheric dlPFC, and local connections.  Functional connectivity differed between the resting state scan and the n-back scan,  with fronto-parietal connectivity greater during the n-back, and interhemispheric  vlPFC connectivity greater during rest. These results demonstrate that fNIRS is  sensitive to both cognitive load and state, suggesting that fNIRS is well-suited to  explore the full complement of neuroimaging research questions and will serve as a  viable alternative to fMRI.","2014","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","76","","","8","","Front Hum Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 24600374  PMCID: PMC3930096","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\2CX8AUB9\Fishburn et al. - 2014 - Sensitivity of fNIRS to cognitive state and load..pdf","","working memory; n-back; functional connectivity; resting state; fronto-parietal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However,  time-of-day modulations may differ across cognitive domains. Using functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated how chronotype and time of day  interact with working memory at different levels of cognitive load/complexity in a  N-back paradigm (N0-, N2-, and N3-back levels). Extreme morning- and evening-type  individuals underwent two fMRI sessions during N-back performance, one 1.5 h  (morning) and one 10.5 h (evening) after wake-up time scheduled according to their  habitual sleep-wake preference. At the behavioral level, increasing working memory  load resulted in lower accuracy while chronotype and time of day only exerted a  marginal impact on performance. Analyses of neuroimaging data disclosed an  interaction between chronotype, time of day, and the modulation of cerebral activity  by working memory load in the thalamus and in the middle frontal cortex. In the  subjective evening hours, evening types exhibited higher thalamic activity than  morning types at the highest working memory load condition only (N3-back).  Conversely, morning-type individuals exhibited higher activity than evening-type  participants in the middle frontal gyrus during the morning session in the N3-back  condition. Our data emphasize interindividual differences in time-of-day preferences  and underlying cerebral activity, which should be taken into account when  investigating vigilance state effects in task-related brain activity. These results  support the hypothesis that higher task complexity leads to a chronotype-dependent  increase in thalamic and frontal brain activity, permitting stabilization of working  memory performance across the day.","2015","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","199","","","6","","Front Neurol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 26441819  PMCID: PMC4585243","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\ALWDXPNU\Schmidt et al. - 2015 - Pushing the Limits Chronotype and Time of Day Mod.pdf","","working memory; BOLD activity; chronotype; task complexity; time of day","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This longitudinal fMRI study of recently diagnosed BD patients  investigates whether aberrant working memory (WM) related activity in the cognitive  control network is accentuated by new affective episodes. METHODS: Forty-seven  recently diagnosed BD patients in full or partial remission and 38 healthy controls  were assessed with neurocognitive tests and fMRI during the performance of a verbal  n-back WM task at baseline and follow-up (15.4 months in average). RESULTS: Patients  showed WM-related hypo-activity in dorsal prefrontal cortex (dPFC) and impaired  cognitive function within attention and psychomotor speed, WM and executive  function, and verbal learning and memory compared to controls at baseline. During  the follow-up period, 26 patients experienced at least one affective episode (BD+),  while 21 remained in remission (BD-). There was no deterioration in cognitive  performance in BD+ compared to BD- patients. Nevertheless, BD+ displayed increased  WM-related dPFC activity at follow-up compared with BD- patients. This change in  dPFC response was independent of mood symptoms and medication. LIMITATIONS: The  study did not account for type or frequency of affective episodes. CONCLUSION: The  study identifies cognitive impairment and WM-related hypo-activity in dPFC early  during the course of BD. Increased high-load WM related dPFC activity over the  follow-up period in BD+ versus BD- patients in the absence of changes in cognitive  performance may reflect an episode-related reduction in PFC efficiency.","2021-12-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","647-656","","","295","","J Affect Disord","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021.

Clinical","","2213-1582","10.1016/j.nicl.2018.09.022","","BACKGROUND: Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is a recreational drug associated with increasing numbers of GHB-dependent patients and emergency attendances often related  to GHB-induced comas. Working memory (WM) deficits have been reported in association  with GHB use, and animal studies have shown that GHB induces oxidative stress in  vulnerable WM-related brain areas such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  (DLPFC). However, the effects of chronic GHB use and multiple GHB-induced comas on  WM-related brain function in humans remains unknown. METHODS: We recruited 27 GHB  users with ≥4 GHB-induced comas (GHB-Coma), 27 GHB users who never experienced  GHB-induced coma (GHB-NoComa), and 27 polydrug users who never used GHB (No-GHB).  Participants performed an n-back WM task during functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI) to probe DLPFC functioning. RESULTS: The GHB-Coma group had lower  premorbid IQ (p = .006) than the GHB-NoComa group despite comparable age and  education level. There were also group differences in the use of other drugs than  GHB. Therefore, all group comparisons were adjusted for IQ and drug use other than  GHB. Compared with the GHB-NoComa and the No-GHB groups, the GHB-Coma group showed  increased activity in the right DLPFC (p(SVC) = 0.028) and increased functional  connectivity of the right DLPFC with a cluster comprising the left anterior  cingulate and medial frontal gyrus (p(FWE) = 0.003). No significant fMRI differences  were observed between the GHB-NoComa and No-GHB groups. Due to technical problems,  no behavioural data were collected. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that multiple  GHB-induced comas, but not GHB-use per se, are associated with alterations in  WM-related brain function. Public awareness campaigns are required to minimize the  potential adverse effects induced by GHB recreational use, and especially  GHB-induced comas, even if no immediate side effects are experienced.","2018","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","923-930","","","20","","Neuroimage Clin","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Comparing networks of healthy volunteers with those of patients can  potentially offer new, quantitative diagnostic methods and a framework for better  understanding brain and mind disorders. We explore resting state functional Magnetic  Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data through network measures. We construct networks  representing 15 healthy individuals and 12 schizophrenia patients (males and  females), all of whom are administered three drug treatments: i) a placebo; and two  antipsychotic medications ii) aripiprazole and iii) sulpiride. We compare these  resting state networks to a performance at an ""N-back"" working memory task. We  demonstrate that not only is there a distinctive network architecture in the healthy  brain that is disrupted in schizophrenia but also that both networks respond to  antipsychotic medication. We first reproduce the established finding that brain  networks of schizophrenia patients exhibit increased efficiency and reduced  clustering compared with controls. Our data then reveal that the antipsychotic  medications mitigate this effect, shifting the metrics toward those observed in  healthy volunteers, with a marked difference in efficacy between the two drugs.  Additionally, we find that aripiprazole considerably alters the network statistics  of healthy controls. Examining the ""N-back"" working memory task, we establish that  aripiprazole also adversely affects their performance. This suggests that changes to  macroscopic brain network architecture result in measurable behavioral differences.  This is one of the first studies to directly compare different medications using a  whole-brain graph theoretical analysis with accompanying behavioral data. The small  sample size is an inherent limitation and means a degree of caution is warranted in  interpreting the findings. Our results lay the groundwork for an objective  methodology with which to calculate and compare the efficacy of different treatments  of mind and brain disorders.","2019","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","611","","","10","","Front Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 Towlson, Vértes, Müller-Sedgwick and Ahnert.","","","","","","PMID: 31572229  PMCID: PMC6752631","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\6H6UCDDA\Towlson et al. - 2019 - Brain Networks Reveal the Effects of Antipsychotic.pdf","","schizophrenia; fMRI; antipscychotic medication; brain network; network science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous imaging studies investigating  working memory in ADHD have used tasks involving different cognitive resources and  ignoring the categorical judgments about objects that are essential parts of  performance in visual working memory tasks, thus complicating the interpretation of  their findings. In the present study, we explored differential neural activation in  children and adolescents with ADHD and in healthy controls using functional magnetic  resonance imaging (fMRI) with the categorical n-back task (CN-BT), which maximized  demands for executive reasoning while holding memory demands constant. METHODS: A  total of 33 drug-naive, right-handed male ADHD without comorbidity (mean age 9.9±2.4  years) and 27 right-handed, healthy male controls (mean age 10.9±2.7 years) were  recruited in the present study. Event-related fMRI was used to study differences in  brain activity during the CN-BT between the two groups. RESULTS: The two groups did  not differ in their accuracy in the CN-BT, although the ADHD patients showed  significantly shorter reaction times to correct responses than did the controls.  During the CN-BT, both ADHD patients and controls showed significant positive and  negative activations by the correct responses, mainly in the sensory-motor pathways  and the striato-cerebellum circuit. Additionally, the ADHD patients showed  significantly higher activation in the bilateral globus pallidus and the right  hippocampus compared with the controls. There was also a positive correlation  between hyperactivation of the left globus pallidus and the reaction time to correct  responses in ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to controls, ADHD patients showed neural  hyperactivation in the striatum and mediotemporal areas during a working memory task  involving categorization. Hyperfunction in these areas might be the  pathophysiological foundation of ADHD, related to the deficits of working memory and  the impulsive symptoms.","2014-08-04","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","116-122","","","53","","Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

However, investigation of this type has been obscured by  incomparable verbal and spatial WM tasks and/or visual inspection at arbitrary  thresholds as means to assess lateralization. Furthermore, it is unclear whether  this hemispheric lateralization is present during adolescence, a time in which WM  skills are improving, and whether there is a developmental association with  laterality of brain functioning. This study used comparable verbal and spatial WM  n-back tasks during fMRI and a bootstrap analysis approach to calculate  lateralization indices (LIs) across several thresholds to examine the potential of a  left-right WM hemispheric dissociation in healthy adolescents. We found significant  left hemispheric lateralization for verbal WM, most notably in the frontal and  parietal lobes, as well as right hemisphere lateralization for spatial WM, seen in  frontal and temporal cortices. Although no significant relationships were observed  between LI and age or LI and performance, significant age-related patterns of brain  activity were demonstrated during both verbal and spatial WM. Specifically,  increased adolescent age was associated with less activity in the default mode brain  network during verbal WM. In contrast, increased adolescent age was associated with  greater activity in task-positive posterior parietal cortex during spatial working  memory. Our findings highlight the importance of utilizing non-biased statistical  methods and comparable tasks for determining patterns of functional lateralization.  Our findings also suggest that, while a left-right hemispheric dissociation of  verbal and spatial WM is apparent by early adolescence, age-related changes in  functional activation during WM are also present.","2013-06","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","58-68","","1","82","","Brain Cogn","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Studies in which imaging of the DA system is integrated with functional imaging during cognitive performance have  yielded mixed findings. Some work has shown a link between striatal DA (measured by  PET) and fMRI activations, whereas others have failed to observe such a  relationship. One possible reason for these discrepant findings is differences in  task demands, such that a more demanding task with greater prefrontal activations  may yield a stronger association with DA. Moreover, a potential DA-BOLD association  may be modulated by task performance. We studied 155 (104 normal-performing and 51  low-performing) healthy older adults (43% females) who underwent fMRI scanning while  performing a working memory (WM) n-back task along with DA D(2/3) PET assessment  using [(11)C]raclopride. Using multivariate partial-least-squares analysis, we  observed a significant pattern revealing positive associations of striatal as well  as extrastriatal DA D(2/3) receptors to BOLD response in the  thalamo-striatal-cortical circuit, which supports WM functioning. Critically, the  DA-BOLD association in normal-performing, but not low-performing, individuals was  expressed in a load-dependent fashion, with stronger associations during 3-back than  1-/2-back conditions. Moreover, normal-performing adults expressing upregulated BOLD  in response to increasing task demands showed a stronger DA-BOLD association during  3-back, whereas low-performing individuals expressed a stronger association during  2-back conditions. This pattern suggests a nonlinear DA-BOLD performance  association, with the strongest link at the maximum capacity level. Together, our  results suggest that DA may have a stronger impact on functional brain responses  during more demanding cognitive tasks.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Dopamine (DA) is a  major neuromodulator in the CNS and plays a key role in several cognitive processes  via modulating the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Some studies  have shown a link between DA and BOLD, whereas others have failed to observe such a  relationship. A possible reason for the discrepancy is differences in task demands,  such that a more demanding task with greater prefrontal activations may yield a  stronger association with DA. We examined the relationship of DA to BOLD response  during working memory under three load conditions and found that the DA-BOLD  association is expressed in a load-dependent fashion. These findings may help  explain the disproportionate impairment evident in more effortful cognitive tasks in  normal aging and in those suffering dopamine-dependent neurodegenerative diseases  (e.g., Parkinson's disease).","2019-01-16","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","537-547","","3","39","","J Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 Salami et al.","","","","","","PMID: 30478031  PMCID: PMC6335744","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\2LZGJK3V\Salami et al. - 2019 - Dopamine D(23) Binding Potential Modulates Neural.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Aged; Middle Aged; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Psychomotor Performance/physiology; *fMRI; *working memory; *PET; Prefrontal Cortex/physiology; *aging; *dopamine; Corpus Striatum/diagnostic imaging/metabolism/physiology; Dopamine Antagonists; Nerve Net/physiology; Positron-Emission Tomography; Raclopride; Radiopharmaceuticals; Receptors, Dopamine D2/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology; Receptors, Dopamine D3/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology; Thalamus/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  aim of the study was to examine a partially remitted and remitted MDD patient group  with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using a cognitive activation  paradigm in order to probe aspects of response inhibition, attention shift, and  working memory. Twenty MDD patients and 19 healthy controls, matched for age and  sex, participated in the study. A working memory n-back task with single  presentations of incongruent Stroop words was used, with the instruction to either  remember the color of the ink the word was written in, or the color word itself,  presented two or three words back in the presentation series. MR images were  acquired on a 1.5-T GE Signa HD MR scanner. In addition to MR data, response time  (RT) and response accuracy (RA) behavioral data were recorded. The behavioral  results showed longer RT and lower RA in the MDD group compared to the control group  across instruction conditions and working memory load. Based on previous studies of  executive function, a composite region of interest (ROI) mask of the anterior  cingulate cortex (ACC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), caudate, and putamen  was used in statistical analysis. Significant activation was observed in controls  throughout this corticostriatal network. When compared to controls, patients showed  no significant difference in the level of activation in the ACC and the DLPFC.  However, in the putamen and caudate, hypoactivation in the patient group was  observed. It was concluded that these effects could be due to a scar effect as a  result of previous episodes of MDD.","2016-09","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","191-205","","3","5","","Psych J","","","","","","","","eng","© 2016 The Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.","","","","","","Place: Australia PMID: 27293083","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\JLGF5DTR\Hammar et al. - 2016 - Striatal hypoactivation and cognitive slowing in p.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Reaction Time; Memory, Short-Term/physiology; Executive Function/*physiology; Depressive Disorder, Major/*physiopathology; Pilot Projects; Brain/physiopathology; cognitive functioning; cognitive slowing; Corpus Striatum/*physiopathology; functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); partially remitted depression; striatal hypoactivation; Stroop Test","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since symptomatic  pharmacological treatment is not yet available alternative treatment strategies such  as cognitive rehabilitation are of particular interest. OBJECTIVES: To analyse the  ways in which MS patients respond to cognitive training, by combining behavioral and  fMRI data in a case-based triangulation approach. METHODS: Ten relapsing-remitting  (RR) MS patients aged between 39 and 58 years and between 1 and 8 years post MS  diagnosis were included. EDSS ranged from 1 to 3.5. Participants had normal to high  intelligence levels. Six patients were assigned to the training group (TG) and four  to the control group (CG) without intervention. The TG received a 4-week  computerized working memory (WM) training, consisting of 16 training sessions of  45 min duration each. Before and after the training a neuropsychological examination  and fMRI investigation by using an N-back task of different complexity was applied.  RESULTS: Patients in the TG responded differently to cognitive training. Four  participants did not meet the triangulation criteria for being treatment responders.  The two responders showed two distinct changes regarding activation patterns after  training: (I) decreased brain activation associated with increased processing speed  and (II) increased brain activation associated with higher processing speed and WM  performance. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of different and opposed response patterns  after the same training indicates a risk in applying classical group statistics.  Different and especially opposed patterns within the same sample may distort results  of classical statistical comparisons. Thus, underlying processes may not be  discovered and lead to misinterpretation of results.","2015","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","78","","","6","","Front Neurol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 25904893  PMCID: PMC4389546","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\I45PKWJM\Hubacher et al. - 2015 - Case-Based fMRI Analysis after Cognitive Rehabilit.pdf","","fMRI; working memory; plasticity; cognitive training; multiple sclerosis; rehabilitation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The primary outcome was PFC  activation during task performance. Five functionally derived regions of interest  (ROI) were defined; in addition, 2 a priori anatomical ROIs were generated for  Brodmann regions 10 and 46. RESULTS: Of the 49 adolescents who underwent imaging,  data from 17 who were exposed to cocaine and 17 who were not exposed were in the  final analysis.

Previous work  has indicated unsatisfactorily low within-subject reliability of amygdala activation  fMRI measures. Based on basic science evidence for strong habituation of amygdala  response to repeated stimuli, we investigated whether a quantification of  habituation provides additional information beyond the usual estimate of the overall  mean activity. We assessed the within-subject reliability of amygdala habituation  measures during a facial emotion matching paradigm in 25 healthy subjects. We  extracted the amygdala signal decrement across the course of the fMRI run for the  two test-retest measurement sessions and compared reliability estimates with  previous findings based on mean response amplitude. Retest-reliability of the  session-wise amygdala habituation was significantly higher than the evoked amygdala  mean amplitude (intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC)=0.53 vs. 0.16). To test  the task-specificity of this finding, we compared the retest-reliability of amygdala  habituation across two different tasks. Significant amygdala response decrement was  also seen in a cognitive task (n-back working memory) that did not per se activate  the amygdala, but was totally unreliable in that context (ICC~0.0), arguing for  task-specificity. Together the results show that emotion-dependent amygdala  habituation is a robust and considerably more reliable index than the mean  amplitude, and provides a robust potential endpoint for within-subject designs  including pharmaco-fMRI studies.","2014-12","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","383-390","","","103","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014.

Although FRDA is most readily  linked to motor and sensory dysfunctions, reported impairments in working memory and  executive functions indicate that abnormalities may also extend to associations  regions of the cerebral cortex and/or cerebello-cerebral interactions. To test this  hypothesis, 29 individuals with genetically confirmed FRDA and 34 healthy controls  performed a verbal n-back working memory task while undergoing functional magnetic  resonance imaging. No significant group differences were evident in task  performance. However, individuals with FRDA had deficits in brain activations both  in the lateral cerebellar hemispheres, principally encompassing lobule VI, and the  prefrontal cortex, including regions of the anterior insular and rostrolateral  prefrontal cortices. Functional connectivity between these brain regions was also  impaired, supporting a putative link between primary cerebellar dysfunction and  subsequent cerebral abnormalities. Disease severity and genetic markers of disease  liability were correlated specifically with cerebellar dysfunction, while  correlations between behavioural performance and both cerebral activations and  cerebello-cerebral connectivity were observed in controls, but not in the FRDA  cohort. Taken together, these findings support a diaschisis model of brain  dysfunction, whereby primary disease effects in the cerebellum result in functional  changes in downstream fronto-cerebellar networks. These fronto-cerebellar  disturbances provide a putative biological basis for the nonmotor symptoms observed  in FRDA, and reflect the consequence of localized cerebellar pathology to  distributed brain function underlying higher-order cognition.","2016-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","338-350","","1","37","","Hum Brain Mapp","","","","","","","","eng","© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","","","","PMID: 26502936  PMCID: PMC6867314","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\AS29BWZB\Harding et al. - 2016 - Fronto-cerebellar dysfunction and dysconnectivity .pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; fMRI; Oxygen/blood; working memory; Case-Control Studies; Reaction Time/physiology; Severity of Illness Index; functional connectivity; cognition; cerebellum; Friedreich ataxia; Cerebellar Diseases/*etiology; Cerebellum/blood supply/*pathology; Cerebral Cortex/blood supply/*pathology; Cognition Disorders/*etiology/*pathology; Friedreich Ataxia/*complications; psychophysiological interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using fMRI, we tested whether  antipsychotic-naïve schizophrenia patients were impaired at deactivating brain  regions that do not subserve WM. METHODS: Twenty-three antipsychotic-naïve patients  with first-episode schizophrenia and 35 healthy individuals underwent whole-brain 3T  fMRI scans while performing a verbal N-back task including 0-back (no WM load),  1-back (low WM load), and 2-back (high WM load) conditions. RESULTS: Contrasting the  2-back and 0-back conditions revealed that patients deactivated default mode network  regions to a similar degree as controls. However, patients were impaired in  deactivating large bilateral clusters centred on the superior temporal gyrus with  increasing WM load. These regions activated with the no WM load condition (0-back)  in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Because 0-back activation reflects verbal attention  processes, patients' persistent activation in the 1-back and 2-back conditions may  reflect an inability to shift cognitive strategy with onset of WM demands. Since  patients were antipsychotic-naïve and task performance was equal to controls, we  infer that this impaired temporoparietal deactivation may represent a primary  dysfunction in schizophrenia.","2011-06","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","271-281","","4","12","","World J Biol Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","© 2011 Informa Healthcare","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 21375473","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Neuropsychological Tests; Brain Mapping/methods; *Memory, Short-Term; Task Performance and Analysis; Parietal Lobe/*physiopathology; Memory Disorders/complications/*physiopathology; Schizophrenia/complications/*physiopathology; Temporal Lobe/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mechanisms for age and performance-graded  differences in brain dynamics have, however, not yet been uncovered. Given the  age-related decline of the dopamine (DA) system in normal cognitive aging, DA  neuromodulation is one plausible mechanism. Hence, agents that boost systemic DA  [such as d-amphetamine (AMPH)] may help to restore deficient signal variability  levels. Furthermore, despite the standard practice of counterbalancing drug session  order (AMPH first vs. placebo first), it remains understudied how AMPH may interact  with practice effects, possibly influencing whether DA up-regulation is functional.  We examined the effects of AMPH on functional-MRI-based blood oxygen level-dependent  (BOLD) signal variability (SD(BOLD)) in younger and older adults during a working  memory task (letter n-back). Older adults expressed lower brain signal variability  at placebo, but met or exceeded young adult SD(BOLD) levels in the presence of AMPH.  Drug session order greatly moderated change-change relations between AMPH-driven  SD(BOLD) and reaction time means (RT(mean)) and SDs (RT(SD)). Older adults who  received AMPH in the first session tended to improve in RT(mean) and RT(SD) when  SD(BOLD) was boosted on AMPH, whereas younger and older adults who received AMPH in  the second session showed either a performance improvement when SD(BOLD) decreased  (for RT(mean)) or no effect at all (for RT(SD)). The present findings support the  hypothesis that age differences in brain signal variability reflect aging-induced  changes in dopaminergic neuromodulation. The observed interactions among AMPH, age,  and session order highlight the state- and practice-dependent neurochemical basis of  human brain dynamics.","2015-06-16","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","7593-7598","","24","112","","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 26034283  PMCID: PMC4475975","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\XYFZ2PG8\Garrett et al. - 2015 - Amphetamine modulates brain signal variability and.pdf","","Humans; Models, Psychological; Female; Male; Adult; Aged; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; fMRI; working memory; Aging/*physiology/*psychology; Least-Squares Analysis; Functional Neuroimaging; Memory, Short-Term/*drug effects; Double-Blind Method; aging; Models, Neurological; brain signal variability; Brain/*drug effects/*physiology; Dextroamphetamine/*pharmacology; dopamine; Dopamine/physiology; Multivariate Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It remains unclear whether those  correlates are already dysfunctional before a transition to psychosis. We used  functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the interaction of working memory  and emotion in 12 persons clinically at high risk for psychosis (CHR) and 12 healthy  subjects individually matched for age, gender and parental education. Participants  performed an n-back task while negative or neutral emotion was induced by olfactory  stimulation. Although healthy and psychosis-prone subjects did not differ in their  working memory performance or the evaluation of the induced emotion, decreased  activations were found in CHR subjects in the superior parietal lobe and the  precuneus during working memory and in the insula during emotion induction. Looking  at the interaction, CHR subjects, showed decreased activation in the right superior  temporal gyrus, which correlated negatively with psychopathological scores.  Decreased activation was also found in the thalamus. However, an increase of  activation emerged in several cerebellar regions. Dysfunctions in areas associated  with controlling whether incoming information is linked to emotional content and in  the integration of multimodal information might lead to compensatory activations of  cerebellar regions known to be involved in olfactory and working memory processes.  Our study underlines that cerebral dysfunctions related to cognitive and emotional  processes, as well as their interaction, can emerge in persons with CHR, even in  absence of behavioral differences.","2010-07","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","167-176","","1-3","120","","Schizophr Res","","","","","","","","eng","(c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Fifteen pediatric cancer survivors  treated with chemotherapy and 15 healthy controls were studied. Blood oxygenation  level dependent (BOLD) fMRI was acquired. A visual n-back task was used to test  working memory function during the fMRI scan. Responses were recorded via an MRI  compatible button box for analysis. fMRI scans were analyzed using statistical  parametric mapping software. All statistics were corrected for multiple comparisons  by false discovery rate, with p < 0.05 as significance. Patients however gave more  incorrect responses (p < 0.05), more no responses (p < 0.05), and longer response  times (p < 0.05) compared with healthy controls. Correct responses generated  significantly lower BOLD responses in the posterior cingulate for pediatric cancer  survivors compared with controls (p < 0.05). Incorrect responses generated  significantly greater BOLD responses in the angular gyrus in survivors (p < 0.05),  and no response trials generated greater BOLD responses within the superior parietal  lobule (p < 0.05) compared with controls. Working memory impairment appears to be  due to an inability to manipulate information and to retrieve information from  memory. The ability to delineate the affected neural circuits associated with  chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment could inform treatment strategies,  identify patients at high risk of developing cognitive deficits, and pre-emptively  tailor behavioral enrichment to overcome specific cognitive deficits.","2020-06","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","e4296","","6","33","","NMR Biomed","","","","","","","","eng","© 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 32215994","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\FS7XQ4KQ\Stefancin et al. - 2020 - Neural correlates of working memory function in pe.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Child; Adolescent; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; *Memory, Short-Term; Brain/*diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology; *acute lymphoblastic leukemia; *blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI; *Cancer Survivors; *chemobrain; *cognitive impairment; *cognitive late effects; *functional MRI; *n-back tasks; Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Normal age-related declines  in working memory can cause loss of independence and decreased quality of life.  Cognitive training has shown some potential at enhancing certain cognitive  processes, although, enhancements are variable. Transcranial direct current  stimulation (tDCS), a form of non-invasive brain stimulation, has shown promise at  enhancing working memory abilities, and may further the benefits from cognitive  training interventions. However, the neural mechanisms underlying tDCS brain-based  enhancements remain unknown. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: Assess the effects of a 2-week  intervention of active-tDCS vs. sham paired with cognitive training on functional  connectivity of the working memory network during an N-Back working memory task.  METHODS: Healthy older adults (N = 28; mean age = 74 ± 7.3) completed 10-sessions of  cognitive training paired with active or sham-tDCS. Functional connectivity was  evaluated at baseline and post-intervention during an N-Back task (2-Back vs.  0-Back). RESULTS: Active-tDCS vs. sham demonstrated a significant increase in  connectivity between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right inferior  parietal lobule at post-intervention during 2-Back. Target accuracy on 2-Back was  significantly improved for active vs. sham at post-intervention. CONCLUSION: These  results suggest pairing tDCS with cognitive training enhances functional  connectivity and working memory performance in older adults, and thus may hold  promise as a method for remediating age-related cognitive decline. Future studies  evaluating optimal dose and long-term effects of tDCS on brain function will help to  maximize potential clinical impacts of tDCS paired with cognitive training in older  adults.

The sample included a sub-sample of CHR participants  who had no lifetime history of treatment with psychotropic medications (n=11). Data  were analyzed using SPM8 (2-back>0-back contrast). Pearson correlations between  brain activity, symptoms, and WM performance were examined. RESULTS: The total CHR  group and medication-naive CHR sub-sample were comparable to controls in most  demographic features and in N-back WM performance, but had significantly lower IQ.  Relative to controls, medication-naïve CHR showed hyperactivity in the left  parahippocampus (PHP) and the left caudate during performance of the N-back WM task.  Relative to medication-exposed CHR, medication naïve CHR exhibited hyperactivity in  the left caudate and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).

However, whether and how  subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) causes any deficits in brain functions, and whether  a hormone-replacement treatment is necessary for SCH patients, still remain  controversial subjects. In the present study, functional MRI (fMRI) was used to  measure brain functions by asking euthyroid subjects, hyperthyroid patients and SCH  patients to perform the widely used digit n-back working memory task. After having  been treated with l-thyroxine for approximately 6 months, the SCH patients were  asked to do the same fMRI experiment. The hypothyroid and SCH patients scored  significantly lower in the 2-back task than either the hyperthyroid patients or the  euthyroid subjects (P < 0.012). The fMRI showed that a common frontoparietal  network, including bilateral middle/inferior frontal gyri (M/IFG), bilateral  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), bilateral premotor areas (PreMA), the  supplementary motor area/anterior cingulate cortex (SMA/ACC) and bilateral parietal  areas (PA), was activated by the n-back task in all the subjects. Further  quantitative analysis showed that the load effect of blood oxygen level-dependent  (BOLD) response appeared in all the five regions of interest (ROIs) in the euthyroid  and hyperthyroid subjects. In the pre-treatment SCH patients, however, the load  effect of BOLD response was only found in the PA and PreMA, but not in other frontal  cortex ROIs [general linear model (GLM), F < 2.6, P > 0.1]. After an approximately 6  month treatment with LT4, the SCH patients exhibited the same load effects in all  five ROIs as the euthyroid subjects (GLM, F > 6, P < 0.05) along with an improvement  of performance in n-back task. These results suggest that working memory (but not  other memory functions) is impaired in SCH patients, mainly as far as disorders of  the frontoparietal network were concerned.

However, the direct link  between genetic risk for OCD and neuro-functional alterations during working memory  performance has not been investigated to date. Thus, the aim of the current  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to test the direct  association between polygenic risk for OCD and neural activity during the  performance of a numeric n-back task with four working memory load conditions in 128  participants, including patients with OCD, unaffected first-degree relatives of OCD  patients, and healthy controls. Behavioral results show a significant performance  deficit at high working memory load in both patients with OCD and first-degree  relatives (p < 0.05). A whole-brain analysis of the fMRI data indicated decreased  neural activity in bilateral inferior parietal lobule and dorsolateral prefrontal  cortex in both patients and relatives. Most importantly, OCD polygenic risk scores  predicted neural activity in orbitofrontal cortex.

Working memory is linked to substance use disorders and can serve as a  representation of the demand placed on the neurophysiology associated with cognitive  control. METHODS: Behavior and brain activity (via fMRI) were recorded during an  N-Back working memory task in controls (CTRL), nondependent heavy drinkers (A-ND)  and dependent heavy drinkers (A-D). Typical and novel step-wise analyses examined  profiles of working memory load and increasing task demand, respectively. RESULTS:  Performance was significantly decreased in A-D during high working memory load  (2-Back), compared to CTRL and A-ND. Analysis of brain activity during high load  (0-Back vs. 2- Back) showed greater responses in the dorsal lateral and medial  prefrontal cortices of A-D than CTRL, suggesting increased but failed compensation.  The step-wise analysis revealed that the transition to Low Demand (0-Back to 1-Back)  was associated with robust increases and decreases in cognitive control and  default-mode brain regions, respectively, in A-D and A-ND but not CTRL. The  transition to High Demand (1-Back to 2-Back) resulted in additional engagement of  these networks in A-ND and CTRL, but not A-D. CONCLUSION: Heavy drinkers engaged  working memory neural networks at lower demand than controls. As demand increased,  nondependent heavy drinkers maintained control performance but relied on additional  neurophysiological resources, and dependent heavy drinkers did not display further  resource engagement and had poorer performance. These results support targeting  these brain areas for treatment interventions.","2017-06-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","24-35","","","175","","Drug Alcohol Depend","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Given that working  memory performance is impaired in schizophrenia, especially at higher executive  loads, the authors investigated how this prefrontal functional organization might be  altered in disease, independent of performance deficits. METHOD: Using N-back  working memory functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, the authors  studied 15 patients with schizophrenia and 26 healthy comparison subjects. Subgroups  based on median performance accuracy at 2-back were analyzed; high performers  included eight schizophrenia patients and 14 comparison subjects, and low performers  included seven patients and 12 comparison subjects. RESULTS: High-performing but not  low-performing comparison subjects responded to incremental working memory executive  load with disproportionately greater dorsal but not ventral prefrontal cortex  activation, which also predicted performance accuracy. In the high- and  low-performing patient groups, incremental working memory load caused a  disproportionate increase in ventral but not dorsal prefrontal cortex activation  relative to the respective comparison group, which also correlated with accuracy.  Functional connectivity between the ventral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal  cortex was relatively greater in patients, whereas comparison subjects had greater  functional connectivity between the dorsal prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal  cortex. CONCLUSIONS: The hierarchical organization of the prefrontal cortex may be  compromised in schizophrenia, resulting in loss of functional specialization and  integration at the dorsal prefrontal cortex and in compensatory activation from the  ventral prefrontal cortex, which may ultimately affect working memory and executive  cognition.","2006-11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1969-1977","","11","163","","Am J Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17074949","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\CI8R3GPR\Tan et al. - 2006 - Dysfunctional prefrontal regional specialization a.pdf","","Humans; Prefrontal Cortex/*physiopathology; Schizophrenia/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the  neural mechanisms underlying effects of tDCS on working memory are not well  understood. This mechanistic study investigated the acute and after-effects of  bilateral frontal (F3/F4) tDCS at 2 mA for 12-min on functional connectivity of the  working memory network in older adults. We hypothesized active tDCS over sham would  increase frontal connectivity during working memory performance. The study used a  double-blind within-subject 2 session crossover design. Participants performed an  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) N-Back working memory task before,  during, and after active or sham stimulation. Functional connectivity of the working  memory network was assessed within and between stimulation conditions (FDR < 0.05).  Active tDCS produced a significant increase in functional connectivity between left  ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and left dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) during  stimulation, but not after stimulation. Connectivity did not significantly increase  with sham stimulation. In addition, our data demonstrated both state-dependent and  time-dependent effects of tDCS working memory network connectivity in older adults.  tDCS during working memory performance produces a selective change in functional  connectivity of the working memory network in older adults. These data provide  important mechanistic insight into the effects of tDCS on brain connectivity in  older adults, as well as key methodological considerations for tDCS-working memory  studies.","2019","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","51","","","11","","Front Aging Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 30930766  PMCID: PMC6428720","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\ZE8G7YZM\Nissim et al. - 2019 - Effects of in-Scanner Bilateral Frontal tDCS on Fu.pdf","","working memory; functional connectivity; cognitive aging; DLPFC (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex); fMRI—functional magnetic resonance imaging; tDCS; transcranial direct cortical stimulation (tDCS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The dysfunction of this region leads to synaptic  neuroplasticity impairment. It has been reported that several biochemical parameters  and anthropometric measurements play a vital role in cognition and brain health.  This study aimed to investigate the relationships between cognitive function, serum  biochemical profile, and anthropometric measurements using DLPFC activation. A  cross-sectional study was conducted among 35 older adults (≥60 years) who  experienced mild cognitive impairment (MCI). For this purpose, we distributed a  comprehensive interview-based questionnaire for collecting sociodemographic  information from the participants and conducting cognitive tests. Anthropometric  values were measured, and fasting blood specimens were collected. We investigated  their brain activation using the task-based functional MRI (fMRI; N-back),  specifically in the DLPFC region. Positive relationships were observed between  brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (β = 0.494, p < 0.01) and Mini-Mental State  Examination (MMSE) (β = 0.698, p < 0.01); however, negative relationships were  observed between serum triglyceride (β = -0.402, p < 0.05) and serum malondialdehyde  (MDA) (β = -0.326, p < 0.05) with right DLPFC activation (R (2) = 0.512) while the  participants performed 1-back task after adjustments for age, gender, and years of  education. In conclusion, higher serum triglycerides, higher oxidative stress, and  lower neurotrophic factor were associated with lower right DLPFC activation among  older adults with MCI. A further investigation needs to be carried out to understand  the causal-effect mechanisms of the significant parameters and the DLPFC activation  so that better intervention strategies can be developed for reducing the risk of  irreversible neurodegenerative diseases among older adults with MCI.","2021","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","765451","","","15","","Front Hum Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 You, Shahar, Mohamad, Rajab, Che Din, Lau and Abdul Hamid.","","","","","","PMID: 35046782  PMCID: PMC8762169","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\XRWAPCJ8\You et al. - 2021 - Is There Any Relationship Between Biochemical Indi.pdf","","cognitive; brain activation; anthropometry; biochemical; biomarkers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Greater WM effects in the old-old than in the young-old group were  identified in the right caudal DLPFC. These results were replicated when we  performed a separate analysis between two age groups with the same level of WM  performance (the young-old vs. a ""high-performing"" subset of the old-old group).  There were no regions where WM effects were greater in the young-old group than in  the old-old group. Importantly, the magnitude of the over-recruitment WM effects  positively correlated with WM performance in the old-old group, but not in the  young-old group.

PPCS was defined as children with a 10-point increase in their post-concussion  symptom inventory score (compared with pre-injury score) at one month post-injury  and a two-point increase in at least two symptom categories compared with  pre-injury. One hundred and seven participants (60 PPCS, 30 recovered mTBI, and 17  controls) with a mean age of 14.2 years (standard deviation [SD] 2.5) (44% male)  were assessed 38 (SD 5.9) days after mTBI. The primary outcome measures were  visuospatial n-back working memory task performance and fMRI blood oxygen level  dependent (BOLD) signal change. Children with PPCS had decreased activation relative  to children with typical recovery in the posterior cingulate and precuneus during  the one-back working memory condition, despite similar task performance. Differences  in cortical activation in children with PPCS at one month highlight the persistent  neurobiological consequences of pediatric mTBI on working memory cortical  activation. These findings encourage recommendations to avoid contact sports and  provide continued care at school for children with persistent symptoms at one month  post-injury.","2019-12-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","3274-3283","","23","36","","J Neurotrauma","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 31115273","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\GMTRCRMZ\Khetani et al. - 2019 - Alteration in Cerebral Activation during a Working.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Child; Adolescent; Cohort Studies; *fMRI; *working memory; Prospective Studies; *Memory, Short-Term/physiology; *mTBI; *PCS; *pediatric; *TBI; Alberta/epidemiology; Brain Concussion/*diagnostic imaging/*epidemiology/psychology; Hospitals, Pediatric/*trends; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/trends; Post-Concussion Syndrome/*diagnostic imaging/*epidemiology/psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These abilities may be partially supported by a large capacity for maintaining and  manipulating social information. Efficient social working memory might arise from  two different sources: chunking of social information or a domain-specific buffer.  We test these hypotheses with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) by  manipulating sociality and working memory load in an n-back paradigm. We observe (i)  an effect of load in the frontoparietal control network, (ii) an effect of sociality  in regions associated with social cognition and face processing, and (iii) an  interaction within the frontoparietal network such that social load has a smaller  effect than nonsocial load. These results support the hypothesis that working memory  is more efficient for social information than for nonsocial information, and suggest  that chunking, rather than a domain-specific buffer, is the mechanism of this  greater efficiency.","2013-04-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","233-239","","","70","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Commonly  observed strategies include prioritisation of gait at the cost of reduced  performance in the cognitive task. Alternatively alterations of gait parameters such  as gait velocity have been reported presumably to free processing capacity for the  benefit of performance in the cognitive task. The aim of this study was to describe  the neuroanatomical correlates of adaptive behavioural strategies in cognitive-motor  dual-tasking when the competition for information processing capacity is severe and  may exceed individuals' capacity limitations. METHODS: During an fMRI experiment, 12  young adults performed slow continuous, auditorily paced bilateral anti-phase ankle  dorsi-plantarflexion movements as an element of normal gait at .5 Hz in single and  dual task modes. The secondary task involved a visual, alphabetic N-back task with  presentation rate jittered around .7 Hz. The N-back task, which randomly occurred in  0-back or 2-back form, was modified into a silent counting task to avoid confounding  motor responses at the cost of slightly increasing the task's general coordinative  complexity. Participants' ankle movements were recorded using an optoelectronic  motion capture system to derive kinematic parameters representing the stability of  the movement timing and synchronization. Participants were instructed to perform  both tasks as accurately as possible. RESULTS: Increased processing complexity in  the dual-task 2-back condition led to significant changes in movement parameters  such as the average inter-response interval, the coefficient of variation of  absolute asynchrony and the standard deviation of peak angular velocity. A  regions-of-interest analysis indicated correlations between these parameters and  local activations within the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) such that lower IFG  activations coincided with performance decrements. CONCLUSIONS: Dual-task  interference effects show that the production of periodically timed ankle movements,  taken as modelling elements of the normal gait cycle, draws on higher-level  cognitive resources involved in working memory. The interference effect  predominantly concerns the timing accuracy of the ankle movements. Reduced  activations within regions of the left IFG, and in some respect also within the  superior parietal lobule, were identified as one factor affecting the timing of  periodic ankle movements resulting in involuntary 'hastening' during severe  dual-task working memory load. This 'hastening' phenomenon may be an expression of  re-automated locomotor control when higher-order cognitive processing capacity can  no longer be allocated to the movements due to the demands of the cognitive task.  The results of our study also propose the left IFG as a target region to improve  performance during dual-task walking by techniques for non-invasive brain  stimulation.","2013-09","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","2142-2153","","11","51","","Neuropsychologia","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This conclusion is based primarily on functional magnetic  resonance imaging (fMRI) data that provides correlational evidence for brain regions  involved in a task. However, fMRI cannot differentiate the areas that are  fundamentally required for performing a task. These data can only come from  brain-injured individuals who fail the task after the loss of specific brain areas.  In addition to the lack of complimentary data, is the issue of the variety in the WM  tasks used to assess verbal WM. When different tasks are assumed to measure the same  behavior, this may mask the contributions of different brain regions. Here, we  investigated the neural substrate of WM by using voxel-based lesion symptom mapping  (VLSM) in 49 individuals with stroke-induced left hemisphere brain injuries. These  participants completed two different verbal WM tasks: complex listening span and a  word 2-back task. Behavioral results indicated that the two tasks were only slightly  related, while the VLSM analysis revealed different critical regions associated with  each task. Specifically, significant detriments in performance on the complex span  task were found with lesions in the inferior frontal gyrus, while for the 2-back  task, significant deficits were seen after injury to the superior and middle  temporal gyri. Thus, the two tasks depend on the structural integrity of different,  non-overlapping frontal and temporal brain regions, suggesting distinct neural and  cognitive mechanisms triggered by the two tasks: rehearsal and cue-dependent  selection in the complex span task, versus updating/auditory recognition in the  2-back task. These findings call into question the common practice of using these  two tasks interchangeably in verbal WM research and undermine the legitimacy of  aggregating data from studies with different WM tasks. Thus, the present study  points out the importance of lesion studies in complementing functional neuroimaging  findings and highlights the need to consider task demands in neuroimaging and  neuropsychological investigations of WM.","2018-07-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","25-41","","","115","","Neuropsychologia","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

It is not yet known whether poor cognitive performance  involving these circuits is part of the familial risk for MDD, and we addressed this  issue using a multi-modal imaging, behavioral and self-report approach in unaffected  first-degree relatives of parent probands with MDD. METHODS: 72 unaffected adult  first-degree relatives of probands with MDD (mean age 30.5 ± 13.4 years) with and 66  case-wise matched non-relative controls underwent functional magnetic resonance  imaging during performance of 'n-back' working memory task, a Go/No-go task  assessing cognitive control and an Auditory Oddball test of selective attention.  Groups were compared on imaging data analyzed voxel wise with a focus on  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and insula regions of  interest, and on corresponding behavioral accuracy and reaction time data.

The Val allele of the functional  Val158Met polymorphism of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene is associated  with reduced prefrontal cortex dopamine and exaggerated working memory-related  prefrontal activity. This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study  investigated for the first time whether the COMT Val158Met genotype modulates  prefrontal activity during spatial working memory in BD. METHODS: Sixty-four  outpatients with BD in full or partial remission were stratified according to COMT  Val158Met genotype (ValVal [n=13], ValMet [n=34], and MetMet [n=17]). The patients  completed a spatial n-back working memory task during fMRI and the Cambridge  Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) Spatial Working Memory test  outside the scanner. RESULTS: During high working memory load (2-back vs 1-back),  Val homozygotes displayed decreased activity relative to ValMet individuals, with  Met homozygotes displaying intermediate levels of activity in the right dorsolateral  prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) (P=.016). Exploratory whole-brain analysis revealed a  bilateral decrease in working memory-related dlPFC activity in the ValVal group vs  the ValMet group which was not associated with differences in working memory  performance during fMRI. Outside the MRI scanner, Val carriers performed worse in  the CANTAB Spatial Working Memory task than Met homozygotes (P≤.006), with deficits  being most pronounced in Val homozygotes.

METHODS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to  investigate longitudinal changes in neuronal activity during working memory  performance via an N-BACK task (0-BACK and 1-BACK) in 27 pre-HD, 17 symp-HD, and 23  control participants. Whole-brain analysis of activation and region-of-interest  analysis of functional connectivity was applied to longitudinal fMRI data collected  at baseline and 18 months follow-up. RESULTS: Compared with controls, the pre-HD  group showed significantly increased activation longitudinally during 1-BACK versus  0-BACK in the lateral and medial prefrontal, anterior cingulate, primary motor, and  temporal areas cortically, and caudate and putamen subcortically. Pre-HD far from  onset, compared with controls, showed further longitudinal increases in the right  and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Longitudinal increased activation  in anterior cingulate and medial primary motor areas were associated with disease  burden in the pre-HD group. Moreover, in pre-HD increased activation over time in  primary motor and putamen regions were associated with average response time during  1-BACK performance. During 1-BACK, functional connectivity between the right DLPFC  and posterior parietal, anterior cingulate, and caudate was significantly reduced  over 18months only in the pre-HD group. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal reductions in  connectivity over 18 months may represent an early signature of cortico-cortical and  cortico-striatal functional disconnectivity in pre-HD, whereas the concomitant  increased cortical and subcortical activation may reflect a compensatory response to  the demands for cognitive resources required during task performance. Our findings  demonstrate that functional imaging modalities have the potential to serve as  sensitive methods for the assessment of cortical and subcortical responses to future  treatment measures.","2013-10","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","80-91","","1","83","","Brain Cogn","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

An open question is whether elderly still have the  flexibility to adapt functional network connectivity (FNC) to the demands of the  task at hand. To study this, we collected fMRI data in younger and older  participants during resting state, a selective attention (SA) task and an n-back  working memory task with varying levels of difficulty. Spatial independent component  (IC) analysis was used to identify functional networks over all participants and all  conditions. Dual regression was used to obtain participant and task specific  time-courses per IC. Subsequently, functional connectivity was computed between all  ICs in each of the tasks. Based on these functional connectivity matrices, a scaled  version of the eigenvector centrality (SEC) was used to measure the total influence  of each IC in the complete graph of ICs. The results demonstrated that elderly  remain able to adapt FNC to task demands. However, there was an age-related shift in  the impetus for FNC change. Older participants showed the maximal change in SEC  patterns between resting state and the SA task. Young participants, showed the  largest shift in SEC patterns between the less demanding SA task and the more  demanding 2-back task. Our results suggest that increased FNC changes from resting  state to low demanding tasks in elderly reflect recruitment of additional resources,  compared with young adults. The lack of change between the low and high demanding  tasks suggests that elderly reach a resource ceiling.","2014-08","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","3788-3804","","8","35","","Hum Brain Mapp","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","","","","PMID: 24382835  PMCID: PMC6869581","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\IBZKTAUI\Geerligs et al. - 2014 - Flexible connectivity in the aging brain revealed .pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Brain Mapping; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; working memory; Brain/*physiology; Aging/*physiology; Attention/*physiology; Neuronal Plasticity/*physiology; Neural Pathways/physiology; Rest; resting state; aging; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; graph theory; adaptability; Adaptation, Psychological/physiology; eigenvector centrality; functional network connectivity; selective attention; task dependent connectivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This measure is  based on previous formulas for the mutual information (MI) between clusters of  regions in the frequency domain. Under the current scenario, the MI can be given as  a simple monotonous function of the multiple coherence and it leads to an easy  visual representation of connectivity patterns. Computationally efficient formulas,  adequate for short time series, are presented and applied to functional magnetic  resonance imaging (fMRI) data measured in subjects (N=34) performing a working  memory task or being at rest. While resting state coherence in high (0.17-0.25 Hz)  and middle (0.08-0.17 Hz) frequency intervals is bilaterally salient in several  limbic and temporal areas including the insula, the amygdala, and the primary  auditory cortex, low frequencies (<0.08 Hz) have greatest connectivity in frontal  structures. Results from the comparison between resting and N-back conditions show  enhanced low frequency coherence in many of the areas previously reported in  standard fMRI activation studies of working memory, but task related reductions in  high frequency connectivity are also found in regions of the default mode network.  Finally, potentially confounding effects of head movement and regional volume on MI  are identified and addressed.","2008-01-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","279-289","","1","39","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17919927","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Sensitivity and Specificity; Computer Simulation; Mental Recall/*physiology; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/*methods; Reproducibility of Results; Neural Pathways/*physiology; *Models, Neurological; *Algorithms; Evoked Potentials/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite recent advances in human neuroimaging techniques, the neural  correlates of lead-exposed cognitive impairment remain unclear. Therefore, this  study was aimed to compare the neural activations in relation to working memory  function between the lead-exposed subjects and healthy controls.

A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)  study (N = 84 healthy volunteers) involving multiple cognitive tasks, including a  Stroop task (to measure attentional executive control), an N-back task (to measure  working memory), and a delay discounting task (to measure decision making) to  identify the brain regions affected by rs1063843 was performed. Across all three  tasks, it was found that carriers of the risk allele consistently exhibited  increased activation of the left DLPFC. In addition, the risk allele carriers also  exhibited increased activation of the right DLPFC and the left cerebellum during the  Stroop task and of the left caudate nucleus during the N-back task.

To determine  whether these activation patterns are evident at a single-subject level, we  conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during five tasks  investigating sensorimotor (finger tapping), language (verb generation), spatial  (mental rotation), working memory (N-back), and emotional processing (viewing images  from the International Affective Picture System). Finger tapping activated the  ipsilateral anterior lobe (lobules IV-V) as well as lobules VI and VIII. Activation  during verb generation was found in right lobules VII and VIIIA. Mental rotation  activated left-lateralized clusters in lobules VII-VIIIA, VI-Crus I, and midline  VIIAt. The N-back task showed bilateral activation in right lobules VI-Crus I and  left lobules VIIB-VIIIA. Cerebellar activation was evident bilaterally in lobule VI  while viewing arousing vs. neutral images. This fMRI study provides the first proof  of principle demonstration that there is topographic organization of motor execution  vs. cognitive/emotional domains within the cerebellum of a single individual, likely  reflecting the anatomical specificity of cerebro-cerebellar circuits underlying  different task domains.

It  has been proposed by Ross and others that emotional prosody cognitions in the right  hemisphere are organized in an analogous fashion to propositional language functions  in the left hemisphere. This study aimed to test the applicability of this model in  the context of prefrontal cortex working memory functions. BOLD response data were  therefore collected during performance of two emotional working memory tasks by  participants undergoing fMRI. In the prosody task, participants identified the  emotion conveyed in pre-recorded sentences, and working memory load was manipulated  in the style of an N-back task. In the matched lexico-semantic task, participants  identified the emotion conveyed by sentence content. Block-design neuroimaging data  were analyzed parametrically with SPM5. At first, working memory for emotional  prosody appeared to be right-lateralized in the PFC, however, further analyses  revealed that it shared much bilateral prefrontal functional neuroanatomy with  working memory for lexico-semantic emotion. Supplementary separate analyses of males  and females suggested that these language functions were less bilateral in females,  but their inclusion did not alter the direction of laterality. It is concluded that  Ross et al.'s model is not applicable to prefrontal cortex working memory functions,  that evidence that working memory cannot be subdivided in prefrontal cortex  according to material type is increased, and that incidental working memory demands  may explain the frontal lobe involvement in emotional prosody comprehension as  revealed by neuroimaging studies.","2007-07-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1015-1025","","3","36","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17481919","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Oxygen/blood; Brain/*physiology; Emotions/*physiology; Functional Laterality/physiology; Sex Characteristics; Nerve Net/*physiology; *Language; *Semantics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methylphenidate (MPH) is an  effective medication to improve these cognitive difficulties. This study aimed to  clarify which effect MPH induces on the underlying functional networks of working  memory. METHODS: Fourteen boys diagnosed with ADHD and 12 healthy controls were  investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Each patient was  tested twice, once with medication and once without. The fMRI experiments consisted  of three verbal N-back tasks with increasing difficulty. Functional images were  acquired on a 3 Tesla head scanner. RESULTS: On the behavioral level, medicated  patients performed similar to healthy controls and significantly better than without  medication. On the functional level, patients showed the expected frontal and  parietal activations, which were more pronounced in the 2- and 3-back tasks. Healthy  controls showed significantly more activation in these regions and additional  activation in the cerebellum. Interestingly, patients showed an additional effect of  laterality. Left-sided frontal and parietal activation in patients was significantly  less pronounced than in controls. CONCLUSION: Functional data indicate different  activation patterns in verbal working memory tasks between healthy controls and  patients with ADHD irrespective of medication condition. Intake of MPH led to a  clear improvement on a behavioral level. However, this effect was not reflected by  changes in functional brain organization. MPH-induced changes leading to better  performance in verbal working memory tasks might be very subtle and therefore not  detectable by fMRI.","2009-11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","516-523","","6","13","","Eur J Paediatr Neurol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 19056305","","","","Humans; Male; Child; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Neuropsychological Tests; Analysis of Variance; Memory, Short-Term/*drug effects; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy; Central Nervous System Stimulants/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Memory Disorders/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*etiology; Methylphenidate/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Machine learning algorithms have become a powerful methodology  for evaluating multi-regional areas of fMRI activation that can classify disease  phenotype from sedentary control. Uncovering objective biomarkers such as an fMRI  pattern is important for lending credibility to diagnosis of CFS. fMRI scans were  evaluated for 69 patients (38 CFS and 31 Control) taken before (Day 1) and after  (Day 2) a submaximal exercise test while undergoing the n-back memory paradigm. A  predictive model was created by grouping fMRI voxels into the Automated Anatomical  Labeling (AAL) atlas, splitting the data into a training and testing dataset, and  feeding these inputs into a logistic regression to evaluate differences between CFS  and control. Model results were cross-validated 10 times to ensure accuracy. Model  results were able to differentiate CFS from sedentary controls at a 80% accuracy on  Day 1 and 76% accuracy on Day 2 (Table 3). Recursive features selection identified  29 ROI's that significantly distinguished CFS from control on Day 1 and 28 ROI's on  Day 2 with 10 regions of overlap shared with Day 1 (Figure 3). These 10 shared  regions included the putamen, inferior frontal gyrus, orbital (F3O), supramarginal  gyrus (SMG), temporal pole; superior temporal gyrus (T1P) and caudate ROIs. This  study was able to uncover a pattern of activated neurological regions that  differentiated CFS from Control. This pattern provides a first step toward  developing fMRI as a diagnostic biomarker and suggests this methodology could be  emulated for other disorders. We concluded that a logistic regression model  performed on fMRI data significantly differentiated CFS from Control.","2020","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","2","","","14","","Front Comput Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Provenzano, Washington and Baraniuk.","","","","","","PMID: 32063839  PMCID: PMC7000378","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\R7CZE2C2\Provenzano et al. - 2020 - A Machine Learning Approach to the Differentiation.pdf","","machine learning; functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS); logistic regression; recursive feature elimination (RFE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ideal target range  of blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in adults outside pregnancy is a matter of  debate. Therefore, prospective intervention studies are needed to evaluate the  effects of an elevated Phe concentration on cognition and structural, functional,  and neurometabolic parameters of the brain. METHODS: The PICO (Phenylalanine and Its  Impact on Cognition) Study evaluates the effect of a 4-week Phe load on cognition  and cerebral parameters in adults with early-treated PKU in a double-blind,  randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover, noninferiority trial. PARTICIPANTS:  Thirty adult patients with early-treated PKU and 30 healthy controls comparable to  patients with regard to age, sex, and educational level will be recruited from the  University Hospitals Bern and Zurich, Switzerland. Patients are eligible for the  study if they are 18 years of age or older and had PKU diagnosed after a positive  newborn screening and were treated with a Phe-restricted diet starting within the  first 30 days of life. INTERVENTION: The cross-over intervention consists of 4-week  oral Phe or placebo administration in patients with PKU. The study design mimics a  Phe-restricted and a Phe-unrestricted diet using a double-blinded,  placebo-controlled approach. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the PICO Study is  to prospectively assess whether a temporarily elevated Phe level influences  cognitive performance (working memory assessed with a n-back task) in adults with  early-treated PKU. As a secondary objective, the PICO Study will elucidate the  cerebral (fMRI, neural activation during a n-back task; rsfMRI, functional  connectivity at rest; DTI, white matter integrity; and ASL, cerebral blood flow) and  neurometabolic mechanisms (cerebral Phe level) that accompany changes in Phe  concentration. Cognition, and structural and functional parameters of the brain of  adult patients with early-treated PKU will be cross-sectionally compared to healthy  controls. All assessments will take place at the University Hospital Bern,  Switzerland. RANDOMIZATION: Central randomization will be used to assign  participants to the different treatment arms with age, sex, and center serving as  the stratification factors. Randomization lists will be generated by an independent  statistician.

Increased  WM load will increase the amount and difficulty of memory information. Several  studies have used electroencephalography (EEG) or functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI) to explore load-dependent cognition processing according to the time  courses of electrophysiological activity or the spatial pattern of blood oxygen  metabolic activity. However, the relationships between these two activities and the  underlying neural mechanism are still unclear. In this study, using simultaneously  collected EEG and fMRI data under an n-back verbal WM task, we modeled the spectral  perturbation of EEG oscillation and fMRI activation through joint independent  component analysis (JICA). Multi-channel oscillation features were also introduced  into the JICA model for further analysis. The results showed that time-locked  activity of theta and beta were modulated by memory load in the early stimuli  evaluation stage, corresponding to the enhanced activation in the frontal and  parietal lobe, which were involved in stimulus discrimination, information encoding  and delay-period activity. In the late response selection stage, alpha and gamma  activity changes dependent on the load correspond to enhanced activation in the  areas of frontal, temporal and parietal lobes, which played important roles in  attention, information extraction and memory retention. These findings suggest that  the increases in memory load not only affect the intensity and time course of the  EEG activities, but also lead to the enhanced activation of brain regions which  plays different roles during different time periods of cognitive process of WM.","2017","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","215","","","11","","Front Behav Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 29163087  PMCID: PMC5671635","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\ZJA7HIL8\Zhao et al. - 2017 - Localized Fluctuant Oscillatory Activity by Workin.pdf","","fMRI; event-related spectral perturbation; joint independent component analysis; memory load; oscillation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the most common cause of  genetic Parkinsonism. Non-manifesting carriers of the G2019S mutation in the LRRK2  gene were found to have lower executive functions as measured by the Stroop task.  This exploratory study aimed to assess whether the cognitive impairment in  non-manifesting carriers is specific for executive functions or includes other  cognitive domains such as working memory. We recruited 77 non-manifesting  first-degree relatives of Parkinson's disease patients (38 carriers). A block-design  fMRI N-back task, with 0-back, 2-back and 3-back conditions, was used in order to  assess working memory. Participants were well matched on the Montreal Cognitive  Assessment, University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, Unified  Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III, digit span, age, gender and Beck  Depression Inventory. The task achieved the overall expected effect in both groups  with longer reaction times and lower accuracy rates with increasing task demands.  However, no whole-brain or region-of-interest between-groups differences were found  on any of the task conditions. These results indicate that non-manifesting carriers  of the G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene have a specific cognitive profile with  executive functions, as assessed by the Stroop task, demonstrating significant  impairment but with working memory, as assessed with the N-back task, remaining  relatively intact. These finding shed light on the pre-motor cognitive changes in  this unique 'at risk' population and should enable more focused cognitive  assessments of these cohorts.","2016-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","106-112","","1","43","","Eur J Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","© 2015 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 26536050","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\49XKFP6L\Thaler et al. - 2016 - Intact working memory in non-manifesting LRRK2 car.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Genotype; Adult; Middle Aged; Brain Mapping; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain/*physiopathology; fMRI; working memory; Executive Function/*physiology; N-back; Family; *Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Heterozygote; Stroop Test; G2019S; Leucine-Rich Repeat Serine-Threonine Protein Kinase-2; LRRK2; Parkinson Disease/*genetics/*physiopathology; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Erythropoietin (EPO) increases  neuroplasticity and may improve cognition in mood disorders, but the neuronal  mechanisms of these effects are unknown. This functional magnetic resonance imaging  (fMRI) study investigated the effects of EPO on neural circuitry activity during  working memory (WM) performance. METHOD: Patients with treatment-resistant major  depression, who were moderately depressed, or with BD in partial remission, were  randomized to eight weekly infusions of EPO (40 000 IU) (N = 30) or saline (N = 26)  in a double-blind, parallel-group design. Patients underwent fMRI, mood ratings and  blood tests at baseline and week 14. During fMRI patients performed an n-back WM  task. RESULTS: EPO improved WM accuracy compared with saline (p = 0.045).  Whole-brain analyses revealed that EPO increased WM load-related activity in the  right superior frontal gyrus (SFG) compared with saline (p = 0.01). There was also  enhanced WM load-related deactivation of the left hippocampus in EPO-treated  compared to saline-treated patients (p = 0.03). Across the entire sample, baseline  to follow-up changes in WM performance correlated positively with changes in  WM-related SFG activity and negatively with hippocampal response (r = 0.28-0.30, p <  0.05). The effects of EPO were not associated with changes in mood or red blood  cells (p ⩾0.08).

Here we investigated its presence in unaffected first-degree  relatives of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD).  Furthermore, we aimed to provide an independent replication of this phenotype in  first-degree relatives of SCZ patients. We acquired functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI) data from 309 healthy controls and 218 healthy first-degree relatives  of index patients with SCZ (n = 62), BD (n = 66) and MDD (n = 90), who completed the  n-back working memory paradigm. We observed a significant group effect on  DLPFC-hippocampus coupling (PFWE = .031, all P-values region of interest [ROI]  corrected). Post hoc comparisons revealed that this effect was driven by the SCZ  relatives, who showed a significant increase in the negative functional connectivity  of the DLPFC and right hippocampus compared to controls (PFWE = .001), BD relatives  (PFWE = .015) and trend-wise also MDD relatives (PFWE = .082). Comparison of BD and  MDD relatives to the controls revealed no difference (PFWE-values > .451).  Supplementary analyses suggested that the SCZ relatives finding is robust to a range  of potential confounds, including structural differences. Our data further support  altered DLPFC-hippocampus connectivity during working memory as an intermediate  phenotype for SCZ.

However, recent evidence suggests greater DMN  activity in an array of tasks, especially those that involve self-referential and  memory-based processing. Although data that robustly demonstrate a comprehensive  functional role for DMN remains relatively scarce, the global workspace framework,  which implicates the DMN in global information integration for conscious processing,  can potentially provide an explanation for the broad range of higher-order paradigms  that report DMN involvement. We used graph theoretical measures to assess the  contribution of the DMN to global functional connectivity dynamics in 22 healthy  volunteers during an fMRI-based n-back working-memory paradigm with parametric  increases in difficulty. Our predominant finding is that brain modularity decreases  with greater task demands, thus adapting a more global workspace configuration, in  direct relation to increases in reaction times to correct responses. Flexible  default mode regions dynamically switch community memberships and display  significant changes in their nodal participation coefficient and strength, which may  reflect the observed whole-brain changes in functional connectivity architecture.  These findings have important implications for our understanding of healthy brain  function, as they suggest a central role for the DMN in higher cognitive processing.  SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The default mode network (DMN) has been shown to increase  its activity during the absence of external stimulation, and hence was historically  assumed to disengage during goal-directed tasks. Recent evidence, however,  implicates the DMN in self-referential and memory-based processing. We provide  robust evidence for this network's active contribution to working memory by  revealing dynamic reconfiguration in its interactions with other networks and offer  an explanation within the global workspace theoretical framework. These promising  findings may help redefine our understanding of the exact DMN role in human  cognition.","2015-11-18","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","15254-15262","","46","35","","J Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 Vatansever et al.","","","","","","PMID: 26586814  PMCID: PMC4649001","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\ZEAS9XYQ\Vatansever et al. - 2015 - Default Mode Dynamics for Global Functional Integr.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; *Brain Mapping; Cognition/*physiology; default mode network; Healthy Volunteers; Linear Models; Brain/blood supply/*physiology; functional connectivity; graph theory; *Models, Neurological; *Nonlinear Dynamics; alluvial diagram; flexibility; large-scale brain network; Nerve Net/blood supply/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Working-memory (a central executive function) may be a powerful  predictor of the course of drug use and drug-related problems. Goal of the current  functional magnetic resonance imaging study was to assess the predictive power of  working-memory network function for future cannabis use and cannabis-related problem  severity in heavy cannabis users. Tensor independent component analysis was used to  investigate differences in working-memory network function between 32 heavy cannabis  users and 41 nonusing controls during an N-back working-memory task. In addition,  associations were examined between working-memory network function and cannabis use  and problem severity at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. Behavioral performance  and working-memory network function did not significantly differ between heavy  cannabis users and controls. However, among heavy cannabis users, individual  differences in working-memory network response had an independent effect on change  in weekly cannabis use 6 months later (ΔR(2) = 0.11, P = 0.006, f(2) = 0.37) beyond  baseline cannabis use (ΔR(2) = 0.41) and a behavioral measure of approach bias  (ΔR(2) = 0.18): a stronger network response during the N-back task was related to an  increase in weekly cannabis use. These findings imply that heavy cannabis users  requiring greater effort to accurately complete an N-back working-memory task have a  higher probability of escalating cannabis use. Working-memory network function may  be a biomarker for the prediction of course and treatment outcome in cannabis users.","2014-05","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","2470-2482","","5","35","","Hum Brain Mapp","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","","","","PMID: 24038570  PMCID: PMC6869744","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\RCUNYP4U\Cousijn et al. - 2014 - Effect of baseline cannabis use and working-memory.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Young Adult; Surveys and Questionnaires; Follow-Up Studies; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; fMRI; Oxygen/blood; Prospective Studies; Memory Disorders/*etiology/*pathology; Analysis of Variance; N-back; cannabis use disorder; working-memory; Predictive Value of Tests; Regression Analysis; Brain/*blood supply/pathology; cannabis; Marijuana Abuse/*complications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVES: We sought to  replicate the association of the COMT val allele with abstinence-induced alterations  in working memory-related activity in task-positive (executive control) and  task-negative (default mode network) regions. METHODS: Forty smokers (20 val/val and  20 met/met) performed an N-back task while undergoing blood oxygen level-dependent  (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on two separate occasions:  following 72 h of confirmed abstinence and during smoking as usual. An independent  sample of 48 smokers who completed the identical N-back task during fMRI in smoking  vs. abstinence for another study was used as a validation sample. RESULTS: Contrary  to expectations, genotype by session interactions on BOLD signal in executive  control regions (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and dorsal cingulate/medial  prefrontal cortex) revealed significant abstinence-induced reductions in the met/met  group, but not the val/val group. Results also revealed that val/val smokers may  exhibit less suppression of activation in task-negative regions such as the  posterior cingulate cortex during abstinence (vs. smoking). These patterns were  confirmed in the validation sample and in the whole-brain analysis, though the  regions differed from the a priori regions of interest (ROIs) (e.g., precuneus,  insula). CONCLUSIONS: The COMT val(158)met polymorphism was associated with  abstinence-related working memory deficits in two independent samples of smokers.  However, inconsistencies compared to prior findings and across methods (ROI vs.  whole-brain analysis) highlight the challenges inherent in reproducing results of  imaging genetic studies in addiction.","2013-12","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","653-662","","4","230","","Psychopharmacology (Berl)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 23828159  PMCID: PMC3840089","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\FH6VHZLY\Ashare et al. - 2013 - Association of abstinence-induced alterations in w.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Genotype; Adult; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Oxygen/blood; Prospective Studies; Cognition; Executive Function/physiology; Catechol O-Methyltransferase/*genetics; Polymorphism, Genetic; Brain/*metabolism; Smoking/genetics/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies in animals demonstrate an interaction between dopamine D2 receptors and nicotinic  acetylcholine receptors on prefrontal behavior but evidence in humans is weak.  Therefore, we hypothesize that genetic variation regulating dopamine D2 and  nicotinic acetylcholine receptor signaling impact prefrontal cortex activity and  related cognition. To test this hypothesis in humans, we explored the interaction  between functional genetic variants in the D2 receptor gene (DRD2, rs1076560) and in  the nicotinic receptor α5 gene (CHRNA5, rs16969968) on both dorsolateral prefrontal  cortex mediated behavior and physiology during working memory and on prefrontal gray  matter volume. METHODS: A large sample of healthy subjects was compared for  genotypic differences for DRD2 rs1076560 (G>T) and CHNRA5 rs16969968 (G>A) on  prefrontal phenotypes, including cognitive performance at the N-Back task,  prefrontal physiology with BOLD fMRI during performance of the 2-Back working memory  task, and prefrontal morphometry with structural MRI. RESULTS: We found that DRD2  rs1076560 and CHNRA5 rs16969968 interact to modulate cognitive function, prefrontal  physiology during working memory, and prefrontal gray matter volume.

Identifying brain-based markers of GCA  has been a longstanding goal of cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Recently,  predictive modeling methods have emerged that build whole-brain, distributed neural  signatures for phenotypes of interest. In this study, we employ a predictive  modeling approach to predict GCA based on fMRI task activation patterns during the  N-back working memory task as well as six other tasks in the Human Connectome  Project dataset (n = 967), encompassing 15 task contrasts in total. We found tasks  are a highly effective basis for prediction of GCA: The 2-back versus 0-back  contrast achieved a 0.50 correlation with GCA scores in 10-fold cross-validation,  and 13 out of 15 task contrasts afforded statistically significant prediction of  GCA. Additionally, we found that task contrasts that produce greater frontoparietal  activation and default mode network deactivation-a brain activation pattern  associated with executive processing and higher cognitive demand-are more effective  in the prediction of GCA. These results suggest a picture analogous to treadmill  testing for cardiac function: Placing the brain in a more cognitively demanding task  state significantly improves brain-based prediction of GCA.","2020-08-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","3186-3197","","12","41","","Hum Brain Mapp","","","","","","","","eng","© 2020 The Authors.

Here we report voxel-by-voxel genetic model fitting in a large sample of 319  healthy, young adult, human identical and fraternal twins (mean ± SD age, 23.6 ± 1.8  years) who performed an n-back working memory task during functional magnetic  resonance imaging (fMRI) at a high magnetic field (4 tesla). Patterns of  task-related brain response (BOLD signal difference of 2-back minus 0-back) were  significantly heritable, with the highest estimates (40-65%) in the inferior,  middle, and superior frontal gyri, left supplementary motor area, precentral and  postcentral gyri, middle cingulate cortex, superior medial gyrus, angular gyrus,  superior parietal lobule, including precuneus, and superior occipital gyri.  Furthermore, high test-retest reliability for a subsample of 40 twins indicates that  nongenetic variance in the fMRI brain response is largely due to unique  environmental influences rather than measurement error. Individual variations in  activation of the working memory network are therefore significantly influenced by  genetic factors. By establishing the heritability of cognitive brain function in a  large sample that affords good statistical power, and using voxel-by-voxel analyses,  this study provides the necessary evidence for task-related brain activation to be  considered as an endophenotype for psychiatric or neurological disorders, and  represents a substantial new contribution to the field of neuroimaging genetics.  These genetic brain maps should facilitate discovery of gene variants influencing  cognitive brain function through genome-wide association studies, potentially  opening up new avenues in the treatment of brain disorders.","2011-07-27","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","10882-10890","","30","31","","J Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 21795540  PMCID: PMC3163233","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\JTRXJZFD\Blokland et al. - 2011 - Heritability of working memory brain activation..pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Genotype; Adult; Young Adult; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Models, Genetic; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; *Brain Mapping; Oxygen/blood; Reproducibility of Results; Statistics as Topic; Intelligence Tests; Psychometrics; Brain/blood supply/*physiology; Sex Factors; Age Factors; Reaction Time/genetics; Environment; Social Class; Twin Studies as Topic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In  our N-back task, task speed and memory load were varied to identify the neural  correlates responsible for the difference between the speed of simple cognitive  processes (estimated from the 0-back task) and the speed of WM. Our findings showed  that this difference was characterized by the increased activation in the right  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the increased functional interaction  between the right DLPFC and right superior parietal lobe. Furthermore, the local  gray matter volume of the right DLPFC was correlated with participants' accuracy  during fast WM tasks, which in turn correlated with a psychometric measure of  participants' intelligence. Our findings indicate that the right DLPFC and its  related network are responsible for the execution of the fast cognitive processes  involved in WM.

Here we sought to  replicate this nonlinear effect in the same sample using a different functional  paradigm to test the generalizability of this phenomenon. Participants (N = 68  healthy adults aged 49-94) underwent fMRI (0-, 2-, 3-, 4-back working memory task;  WM) and (18)F-Florbetapir PET scanning. A parametric WM load contrast was used as  the dependent variable in a model with age, mean cortical Aβ, and Aβ(2) as  predictors. Results revealed that nonlinear amyloid (Aβ(2)) was a significant  negative predictor of modulation of activation to WM load in two large inferior  clusters: bilateral subcortical nuclei and bilateral lateral cerebellum. Individuals  with slightly elevated Aβ burden evidenced greater modulation as compared to  individuals with little or no Aβ burden, whereas individuals with the greatest Aβ  burden evidenced lesser modulation as compared to individuals with slightly elevated  Aβ. Increased modulation to WM load predicted better task accuracy and executive  function measured outside the scanner. The current study provides further evidence  for a dose-response, nonlinear relationship between increasing Aβ burden and  alteration in brain activation in cognitively healthy adults, extending the existing  evidence to dynamic range of activation to task difficulty, and reconciling  seemingly discrepant effects of amyloid on brain function.","2018-12","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","142-149","","","183","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Previous research showed that APOE4 is associated with increased risk  of occurrence and earlier onset of AD in a gene dose-dependent manner. However, the  specific role of APOE4 in processing of brain functions requires further  investigation. Investigators have used fMRI to measure brain activity on the basis  of the blood oxygen level-dependent contrast. This study investigates the effects of  APOE4 on fMRI during n-back WM tasks in healthy middle-aged adults. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: From 110 participants, 81 individuals without objective or subjective  cognitive impairment underwent APOE genotyping. Nine APOE4 carriers and 9 age- and  sex-matched non-APOE4 controls were recruited for fMRI examinations during WM tasks.  RESULTS: Both groups displayed increased brain activation in response to increases  in WM loads. During low-WM-load tasks, the APOE4 carriers recruited significantly  greater additional processing resources than the non-APOE4 carriers. During  moderate- and high-WM-load tasks, the APOE4 carrier group displayed fewer increases  in activation than the non-APOE4 carrier group.

METHODS: A  parametric fMRI experiment with 4 levels of visuospatial N-back task was used to  investigate the pattern of cortical activation in 17 men with untreated moderate or  severe OSA and 7 age-matched HC. Categorical and parametrical analysis of the data  was performed. Multiple regression analysis of fMRI data of OSA patients was  performed with AHI, nocturnal desaturation time, and BMI as covariates. RESULTS: OSA  patients demonstrate compensatory spatial recruitment of the TPN (maximal at 3-back)  and of the DMN (maximal at 2-back). HC had a different patten of spatial recruitment  and deactivation of the DMN at the maximal load of task (3-back). Nocturnal  desaturation had significant positive correlation with BOLD signal in bilateral  frontal, temporal, and occipital regions, and negative correlations in bilateral  frontal and left parietal regions; whereas BMI showed only negative correlations  with BOLD signal, predominantly in the PFC. AHI was positively correlated with BOLD  signal in bilateral frontal regions.

Thirteen individuals with MS and 12 HCs underwent fNIRS recording while  performing the n-back WM task with four levels of difficulty (0-, 1-, 2-, and  3-back). Subjects were fitted with the fNIRS cap consisting of 30 'optodes'  positioned over the forehead. The results revealed different patterns of brain  activation in MS and HCs. The MS group showed an increase in brain activation, as  measured by the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyHb), in the left superior  frontal gyrus (LSFG) at lower task difficulty levels (i.e. 1-back), followed by a  decrease at higher task difficulty (2- and 3-back) as compared with the HC group.

However, how estrogen loss and subsequent estrogen treatment affects  cognition and particularly the underlying brain processes responsible for any  cognitive changes is less well understood. We examined the ability of estradiol to  modulate the manipulation of information in working memory and related brain  activation in postmenopausal women. Twenty healthy postmenopausal women (mean age  (SD)=59.13 (5.5)) were randomly assigned to three months of 1mg oral 17-β estradiol  or placebo. At baseline and three months later each woman completed a visual verbal  N-back sequential letter test of working memory during functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI). The fMRI data showed that women who were treated with estradiol for  three months had increased frontal activation during the more difficult working  memory load conditions compared to women treated with placebo. Performance on the  verbal working memory task showed no difference between estradiol and placebo  treated subjects. These data are consistent with prior work showing increases in  frontal activation on memory tasks after estrogen treatment.

The effective connectivity between DLPFC and HF  was analyzed using a simple two-region sDCM. For each subject, we evaluated  sixty-seven alternative sDCMs and compared their relative plausibility using  Bayesian model selection (BMS). Across all locations, BMS consistently revealed the  same winning model, with the 2-Back working memory condition as driving input to  both DLPFC and HF and with a connection from DLPFC to HF. Statistical tests on the  sDCM parameter estimates did not show any significant differences across the three  sites. The consistency of both the BMS results and model parameter estimates  indicates the reliability of sDCM in our paradigm.

METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 20 subjects with MS who smoked cannabis and 19  noncannabis users with MS, matched on demographic and neurologic variables,  underwent fMRI while completing a test of working memory, the N-Back. Resting-state  fMRI and structural MRI data (lesion and normal-appearing brain tissue volumes,  diffusion tensor imaging metrics) were also collected. Neuropsychological data  pertaining to verbal (Selective Reminding Test Revised) and visual (10/36 Spatial  Recall Test) memory, information processing speed (Paced Auditory Serial Addition  Test [2- and 3-second versions] and Symbol Digit Modalities Test), and attention  (Word List Generation) were obtained. RESULTS: The cannabis group performed more  poorly on the more demanding of the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test tasks (i.e.,  2-second version) (p < 0.02) and the 10/36 Spatial Recall Test (p < 0.03). Cannabis  users had more diffuse cerebral activation across all N-Back trials and made more  errors on the 2-Back task (p < 0.006), during which they displayed increased  activation relative to nonusers in parietal (p < 0.007) and anterior cingulate (p <  0.001) regions implicated in working memory. No group differences in resting-state  networks or structural MRI variables were found. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MS who  smoke cannabis are more cognitively impaired than nonusers. Cannabis further  compromises cerebral compensatory mechanisms, already faulty in MS. These imaging  data boost the construct validity of the neuropsychological findings and act as a  cautionary note to cannabis users and prescribers.","2014-05-27","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1879-1887","","21","82","","Neurology","","","","","","","","eng","© 2014 American Academy of Neurology.","","","","","","PMID: 24789863  PMCID: PMC4105254","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\PA6G48VT\Pavisian et al. - 2014 - Effects of cannabis on cognition in patients with .pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Cross-Sectional Studies; Psychometrics; Cognition/*drug effects/physiology; Brain/*drug effects/physiopathology; Marijuana Smoking/*adverse effects; Multiple Sclerosis/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the same time, previous studies showed that WM training in older  adults may improve the performance in the trained task (training effect), and more  importantly, also in untrained WM tasks (transfer effects). However, neural  correlates of these transfer effects that would improve understanding of its  underlying mechanisms, have not been shown in older participants as yet. In this  study, we investigated blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes during  n-back performance and an untrained delayed recognition (Sternberg) task following  12sessions (45min each) of adaptive n-back training in older adults. The Sternberg  task used in this study allowed to test for neural training effects independent of  specific task affordances of the trained task and to separate maintenance from  updating processes. Thirty-two healthy older participants (60-75years) were assigned  either to an n-back training or a no-contact control group. Before (t1) and after  (t2) training/waiting period, both the n-back task and the Sternberg task were  conducted while BOLD signal was measured using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging  (fMRI) in all participants. In addition, neuropsychological tests were performed  outside the scanner. WM performance improved with training and behavioral transfer  to tests measuring executive functions, processing speed, and fluid intelligence was  found. In the training group, BOLD signal in the right lateral middle frontal  gyrus/caudal superior frontal sulcus (Brodmann area, BA 6/8) decreased in both the  trained n-back and the updating condition of the untrained Sternberg task at t2,  compared to the control group. fMRI findings indicate a training-related increase in  processing efficiency of WM networks, potentially related to the process of WM  updating. Performance gains in untrained tasks suggest that transfer to other  cognitive tasks remains possible in aging.","2016-07-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","236-249","","","134","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is  a noninvasive tool to increase local excitability of neurons and induce short-time  functional reorganization of cortical networks. While this has been shown for the  motor system, little is known about the short-term plasticity of networks for  executive cognition in humans. We examined 12 healthy control subjects in a  crossover study with fMRI after real and sham 5 Hz rTMS to the right dorsolateral  prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). During scanning, subjects performed an n-back working  memory (WM) task and a flanker task engaging cognitive control. Reaction times  during the n-back task were significantly shorter after rTMS than after sham  stimulation. RTMS compared with sham stimulation caused no activation changes at the  stimulation site (right DLPFC) itself, but significantly increased connectivity  within the WM network during n-back and reduced activation in the anterior cingulate  cortex during the flanker task. Reduced reaction times after real stimulation  support an excitatory effect of high-frequency rTMS. Our findings identified plastic  changes in prefrontally connected networks downstream of the stimulation site as the  substrate of this behavioral effect. Using a multimodal fMRI-rTMS approach, we could  demonstrate changes in cortical plasticity in humans during executive cognition. In  further studies this approach could be used to study pharmacological, genetic and  disease-related alterations.","2014-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","140-151","","1","35","","Hum Brain Mapp","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","","","","PMID: 22965696  PMCID: PMC6868951","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\WMIIQT77\Esslinger et al. - 2014 - Induction and quantification of prefrontal cortica.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Young Adult; Brain Mapping; Cognition/physiology; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Prefrontal Cortex/*physiology; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; fMRI; connectivity; working memory; Cross-Over Studies; Reaction Time/physiology; Neuronal Plasticity/*physiology; Neural Pathways/physiology; plasticity; prefrontal cortex; *Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; interference control; rTMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

So far, no experimental study has explored the  effects of memory for emotional stimuli in patients with mild cognitive impairment  (MCI), a concept that describes a transitional state between normal aging and  dementia. The present fMRI study explored working memory for emotional stimuli in 16  patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) and 16 healthy aged participants. Subjects  performed an n-back task (2-back) with neutral, positive, and negative emotional  pictures. The analysis focused on target processing. Results showed that groups did  not differ in working memory performance. In healthy aged participants emotional  targets had no significant impact on working memory. In patients with aMCI a  negativity bias was observed, indicating that negative targets were better  remembered compared to neutral and positive targets. Regarding fMRI results, both  groups showed an increase in functional activity in prefrontal and lateral parietal  brain regions associated with target processing. As a key result, we observed  significant group by emotion interaction effects in the precuneus. Healthy aged  participants showed a signal decrease in the left precuneus for positive compared to  neutral targets. The precuneus deactivation in healthy aged participants may  indicate a disengagement of self-referential processes towards task-related  processes. Patients with aMCI revealed a signal increase in the right precuneus for  negative compared to neutral targets. This increase in precuneus activity, combined  with a behavioural facilitation effect, may indicate a mechanism to compensate  disease related processes in aMCI.","2008-01-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","37-48","","1","46","","Neuropsychologia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 17915264","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Aged; Middle Aged; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Neuropsychological Tests; Oxygen/blood; Emotions/*physiology; Photic Stimulation/methods; Analysis of Variance; Cerebral Cortex/blood supply/*physiopathology; Cognition Disorders/*pathology/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Changes in the level of  coherence between the two sentences as well as context length were also investigated  across discourse items. The WM system was identified with a verbal N-back task.  Analysis of the reading comprehension task revealed that within the WM system,  stronger activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus corresponded with increased  bridging coherence demands between sentences, while greater activation in the left  inferior and middle frontal gyri, bilateral superior frontal gyri, and bilateral  inferior parietal lobules corresponded with increased context length. Topic  variation showed no effect on activation of the WM system. These results provide new  insights into understanding how different levels of context features modulate  activation of the subcomponents of the WM system and indicate a role for the left  inferior frontal gyrus as a core component of the WM system supporting discourse  processing.","2018-03","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","36-44","","","111","","Neuropsychologia","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Participants were grouped into 105  monozygotic twin, 78 dizygotic twin, 99 nontwin sibling, and 100 unrelated pairs.  Activation pattern similarity was used to test the hypothesis that FrontoParietal  regions would have higher similarity for same load conditions, while Visual regions  would have higher similarity in same perceptual category conditions. Results  confirmed this highly robust regional double dissociation in neural coding, which  also predicted individual differences in behavioral performance. In pair-based  analyses, anatomically selective genetic relatedness effects were observed:  relatedness predicted greater activation pattern similarity in FrontoParietal only  for load coding and in Visual only for perceptual coding. Further, in related pairs,  the similarity of load coding in FrontoParietal regions was uniquely associated with  behavioral performance. Together, these results highlight the power of task fMRI  pattern similarity analyses for detecting key coding and heritability features of  brain regions.","2020-05-14","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","3167-3183","","5","30","","Cereb Cortex","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2020.

Nevertheless, its contribution to whole-brain connectivity dynamics across  increasing working memory load has not been explicitly assessed. The aim of our  study was to determine which DMN hubs relate to working memory task performance  during an fMRI-based n-back paradigm with parametric increases in difficulty. Using  a voxel-wise metric, termed the intrinsic connectivity contrast (ICC), we found that  the bilateral angular gyri (core DMN hubs) displayed the greatest change in global  connectivity across three levels of n-back task load. Subsequent seed-based  functional connectivity analysis revealed that the angular DMN regions robustly  interact with other large-scale brain networks, suggesting a potential involvement  in the global integration of information. Further support for this hypothesis comes  from the significant correlations we found between angular gyri connectivity and  reaction times to correct responses. The implication from our study is that the DMN  is actively involved during the n-back task and thus plays an important role related  to working memory, with its core angular regions contributing to the changes in  global brain connectivity in response to increasing environmental demands.

However, it remains unclear, if and in what way IS influences cognition.  Here, we conducted an fMRI experiment, in which 13 healthy participants were exposed  to IS, while cognitive performance was assessed in an n-back working memory  paradigm. During the task, short sinusoidal tone bursts of 12 Hz were administered  monaurally with sound pressure levels that had been determined individually in a  categorical loudness scaling session prior to the fMRI experiment. We found that  task execution was associated with a significant activation of the prefrontal and  the parietal cortex, as well as the striatum and the cerebellum, indicating the  recruitment of a cognitive control network. Reverse contrast analysis (n-back with  tone vs. n-back without tone) revealed a significant activation of the bilateral  primary auditory cortex (Brodmann areas 41, 42). Surprisingly, we also found a  strong, yet non-significant trend for an improvement of task performance during IS  exposure. There was no correlation between performance and brain activity measures  in tone and no-tone condition with sum scores of depression-, anxiety-, and  personality factor assessment scales (BDI, STAIX1/X2, BFI-S). Although exerting a  pronounced effect on cortical brain activity, we obtained no evidence for an  impairment of cognition due to brief bursts of IS.

Contrary to prior findings with event-based PM (i.e.,  remembering to perform a future action when a specific event occurs), no sustained  PM-related activity was observed in anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) or elsewhere  in the brain; instead, transient clock-related activity was observed in this region.  Critically, the activation was anticipatory, increasing before clock-check  responses. Anticipatory activity prior to the PM target response was weaker in aPFC,  but strong in pre-Supplementary Motor Area (pre-SMA; relative to clock-check  responses), suggesting a functional double dissociation related to volitional  decision-making. Together, the results suggest that aPFC-activity dynamics during  time-based PM reflect a distinct transient monitoring process, enabling integration  of the PM intention with current temporal information to facilitate scheduling of  upcoming PM-related actions.","2014","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","e92123","","3","9","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 24643226  PMCID: PMC3958452","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\VY9VMKH4\Oksanen et al. - 2014 - Neural mechanisms of time-based prospective memory.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Time Factors; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Reaction Time; Cognition/*physiology; Memory, Short-Term/physiology; *Memory, Episodic; Attention/physiology; Delay Discounting/physiology; Prefrontal Cortex/anatomy & histology/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, between-studies inconsistencies as to the specific  functional substrate imply that inter-individual variability (IIV) in the WM  performance is associated with IIV in brain activity in schizophrenia. To examine  the neural substrate of this WM IIV, we studied whether the neural mechanisms that  underlie individual differences in WM capacity are the same in schizophrenia  patients and healthy people. We correlated the IIV of the task-evoked brain activity  and task performance during an n-back WM task with the IIV of the moment-to-moment  variability in intrinsic resting-state activity, as measured by the amplitude of  low-frequency fluctuations (ALFFs) and further compared this relationship between 17  patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES) and 18 healthy controls.  Between-group comparisons of the correlation patterns indicated aberrant ALFF-WM  activation correlations and ALFF-WM performance correlations in the FES patients,  but no significant changes were detected in any single measurement of these three  characteristics. Specifically, we found increased positive ALFF-WM activation  correlations in the bilateral lateral prefrontal cortices, posterior parietal  cortices and fusiform gyri in the FES patients. We also observed significant  increases in positive ALFF-WM performance correlations in the bilateral ventromedial  prefrontal cortices in the FES patients. This hyper-coupling between the ALFF and  fMRI measures during a WM task may indicate that it was difficult for the patients  to detach themselves from one state to transition to another and suggests that the  inefficient cortical function in schizophrenia stems from the intrinsic functional  architecture of the brain.","2014-10","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","80-89","","1","159","","Schizophr Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

DESIGN: Randomized,  double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Academic medical center.  PARTICIPANTS: Healthy older adults (62-80 years) with subjective memory impairment,  but not meeting criteria for mild cognitive impairment or dementia. INTERVENTION:  Fish oil (EPA+DHA: 2.4 g/d, n=11) or placebo (corn oil, n=10) for 24 weeks.  MEASUREMENTS: Cortical BOLD response patterns during performance of a sequential  letter n-back working memory task were determined at baseline and week 24 by  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). RESULTS: At 24 weeks erythrocyte  membrane EPA+DHA composition increased significantly from baseline in participants  receiving fish oil (+31%, p ≤ 0.0001) but not placebo (-17%, p=0.06). Multivariate  modeling of fMRI data identified a significant interaction among treatment, visit,  and memory loading in the right cingulate (BA 23/24), and in the right sensorimotor  area (BA 3/4). In the fish oil group, BOLD increases at 24 weeks were observed in  the right posterior cingulate and left superior frontal regions during memory  loading. A region-of-interest analysis indicated that the baseline to endpoint  change in posterior cingulate cortex BOLD activity signal was significantly greater  in the fish oil group compared with the placebo group during the 1-back (p=0.0003)  and 2-back (p=0.0005) conditions. Among all participants, the change in erythrocyte  EPA+DHA during the intervention was associated with performance in the 2-back  working memory task (p = 0.01), and with cingulate BOLD signal during the 1-back (p  = 0.005) with a trend during the 2-back (p = 0.09). Further, cingulate BOLD activity  was related to performance in the 2-back condition. CONCLUSION: Dietary fish oil  supplementation increases red blood cell omega-3 content, working memory  performance, and BOLD signal in the posterior cingulate cortex during greater  working memory load in older adults with subjective memory impairment suggesting  enhanced neuronal response to working memory challenge.","2016-02","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","161-169","","2","20","","J Nutr Health Aging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 26812512","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\26UDV8L9\Boespflug et al. - 2016 - Fish Oil Supplementation Increases Event-Related P.pdf","","Humans; Animals; Female; Male; Aged; Middle Aged; Oxygen/blood; Memory, Short-Term/*drug effects; Double-Blind Method; *Dietary Supplements; Docosahexaenoic Acids/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Eicosapentaenoic Acid/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Erythrocyte Membrane/drug effects/metabolism; Erythrocytes/drug effects/metabolism; Fish Oils/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Gyrus Cinguli/*drug effects; Memory Disorders/blood/*drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated the effects  of social evaluative threat on working memory (WM), a core component of many  important cognitive capabilities. Social threat impaired WM performance during an  N-back task and produced widespread reductions in activation in lateral prefrontal  cortex and intraparietal sulcus (IPS), among other regions. In addition, activity in  frontal and parietal regions predicted WM performance, and mediation analyses  identified regions in the bilateral IPS that mediated the performance-impairing  effects of social threat. Social threat also decreased connectivity between the IPS  and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, while increasing connectivity between the IPS  and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a region strongly implicated in the  generation of autonomic and emotional responses. Finally, cortisol response to the  stressor did not mediate WM impairment but was rather associated with protective  effects.

Molecular cascades downstream of D2 receptor include a cAMP-dependent- and a  cAMP-independent-pathway. Protein-Phosphatase-2A (PP2A) is a key partner of D2  receptor in cAMP-independent signaling. This enzyme comprises a regulatory subunit  that is coded by PPP2R2B gene. Given the molecular relationship between PP2A and D2  signaling, we hypothesized genetic variation in PPP2R2B affecting mRNA expression of  this gene in prefrontal cortex to be associated with prefrontal processing during  working memory. In order to probe such a hypothesis we investigated SNPs associated  with PPP2R2B expression in two independent samples of human postmortem prefrontal  cortex. Then, we tested SNPs for which association was replicated as predictors of  prefrontal activity during WM as probed by functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) in a  sample of healthy humans. We found that a SNP associated with PPP2R2B expression  (rs959627) predicted prefrontal activity during the N-Back working memory task. In  particular, individuals carrying rs959627T allele, a condition associated with lower  PPP2R2B expression in postmortem prefrontal cortex, showed greater activity in right  inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) during N-Back compared to CC subjects. Furthermore,  such an activity was negatively correlated with behavioral performance at the task.  Consistently with previous studies, these findings suggest reduced right IFG  efficiency during working memory processing in rs959627 T-carriers, as indexed by  their greater need to activate this brain region in order to achieve similar levels  of behavioral proficiency as compared to CC individuals.","2017-01-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","125-130","","","316","","Behav Brain Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However,  these studies have often failed to consider the potential role of task-related  deactivation. METHOD: Thirty-two patients with chronic schizophrenia and 32 age- and  sex-matched normal controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)  scanning while performing baseline, 1-back and 2-back versions of the n-back task.  Linear models were used to obtain maps of activations and deactivations in the  groups. RESULTS: The controls showed activation in the expected frontal regions.  There were also clusters of deactivation, particularly in the anterior  cingulate/ventromedial PFC and the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus. Compared to  the controls, the schizophrenic patients showed reduced activation in the right  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and other frontal areas. There was also an  area in the anterior cingulate/ventromedial PFC where the patients showed apparently  greater activation than the controls. This represented a failure of deactivation in  the schizophrenic patients. Failure to activate was a function of the patients'  impaired performance on the n-back task, whereas the failure to deactivate was less  performance dependent. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with schizophrenia show both failure to  activate and failure to deactivate during performance of a working memory task. The  area of failure of deactivation is in the anterior prefrontal/anterior cingulate  cortex and corresponds to one of the two midline components of the 'default mode  network' implicated in functions related to maintaining one's sense of self.","2008-08","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1185-1193","","8","38","","Psychol Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 18507885","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\KL9NHIH9\Pomarol-Clotet et al. - 2008 - Failure to deactivate in the prefrontal cortex in .pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Middle Aged; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Prefrontal Cortex/*physiopathology; Nerve Net/*physiopathology; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Memory Disorders/diagnosis/epidemiology/physiopathology; Schizophrenia/diagnosis/epidemiology/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aging adults from low-income households are  individuals with a high risk of cognitive decline who incorporate ulam in their  daily diet. PURPOSE: To examine relationship between ulam consumption and the  working memory and cognitive flexibility among aging adults from low-income  households who are more susceptible to cognitive decline. STUDY TYPE:  Cross-sectional. POPULATION/SUBJECTS: Thirty-two aging adults (45-75 years old).  FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: Task-based fMRI, 3.0T, T(1) -weighted anatomical images,  T(2) *-weighted imaging data. ASSESSMENT: The dietary and ulam consumption were  assessed using the respective validated Dietary History and semiquantitative Food  Frequency questionnaires. Working memory and cognitive flexibility were evaluated by  using neuropsychological batteries (ie, mini-mental state examination [MMSE], Digit  Span, and Rey auditory verbal learning test [RAVLT]) and task-based fMRI (N-back and  Stroop Color Word Test [SCWT]). Brodmann's areas 9 and 46 were the regions of  interest (ROIs) of DLPFC activation. STATISTICAL TESTS: Multiple linear regression  used to understand the relationship between ulam consumption and the working memory  and cognitive flexibility, while analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare  the difference of working memory and cognitive flexibility among four percentiles of  ulam consumption, after age, gender, and education years adjustments. Significance  was decided by two-sided, P < 0.0042 and P < 0.05. RESULTS: The multiple linear  regression revealed that ulam consumption was positively associated with the Digit  Span (R(2) = 0.51, β = 0.702, P < 0.001), right DLPFC activation (1-back) (R(2) =  0.34, β = 0.591, P = 0.001), left DLPFC activation (SCWT-1) (R(2) = 0.33, β = 0.553,  P = 0.002), and left DLPFC activation (SCWT-2) (R(2) = 0.34, β = 0.497, P = 0.004).  The ulam consumption at the 75(th) and 100(th) percentile from the ANCOVA analysis  had shown a better working memory and cognitive flexibility as compared with those  of the 25(th) and 50(th) percentiles (P < 0.05). DATA CONCLUSION: This study found  that high ulam consumption was related to a high intensity of brain activation in  DLPFC; however, the elucidation of the neuroprotective properties of ulam have yet  to be established from clinical trial studies.

However, the underlying mechanisms of BOLD fMRI are still not  completely understood and PET imaging requires injection of radioactive tracers. In  this study, a pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) perfusion imaging  technique was used to quantify cerebral blood flow (CBF), a well understood  physiological index reflective of cerebral metabolism, in N-back working memory  tasks. Using pCASL, we systematically investigated brain activation and deactivation  induced by the N-back working memory tasks and further studied the load effects on  brain activity based on quantitative CBF. Our data show increased CBF in the  fronto-parietal cortices, thalamus, caudate, and cerebellar regions, and decreased  CBF in the posterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex, during the  working memory tasks. Most of the activated/deactivated brain regions show an  approximately linear relationship between CBF and task loads (0, 1, 2 and 3 back),  although several regions show non-linear relationships (quadratic and cubic). The  CBF-based spatial patterns of brain activation/deactivation and load effects from  this study agree well with those obtained from BOLD fMRI and PET techniques. These  results demonstrate the feasibility of ASL techniques to quantify human brain  activity during high cognitive tasks, suggesting its potential application to  assessing the mechanisms of cognitive deficits in neuropsychiatric and neurological  disorders.","2011-04","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","127-210","","2","12","","J Cogn Sci (Seoul)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 24222759  PMCID: PMC3821165","","","","cerebral blood flow; load effects; N-back working memory; pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our study attempted to equate TBI  patients and orthopedically injured (OI) subjects on performance of an N-Back task  that used faces as stimuli. To minimize confusion in TBI patients that was revealed  in pilot work, we presented the memory conditions in two separate tasks, 0- versus  1-back and 0- versus 2-back.

In the 2-back condition, both groups  showed decreases over time in fusiform and parahippocampal gyri, although the OI  group also showed increases over time in frontal, parietal, and temporal areas not  seen in the TBI patients. The greatest group differences were found in the 1-back  condition, which places low demand on WM. Although the extent of activation in the  2-back condition did not differ between the two groups, deactivation in the 2-back  condition was seen in the OI patients only, and both groups' patterns of activation  over time varied, suggesting a dissociation between the TBI and OI patients in  recruitment of neural areas mediating WM.","2007-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","95-111","","1","43","","Cortex","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Italy PMID: 17334210","","","","Humans; Adolescent; Adult; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Reference Values; Case-Control Studies; Reaction Time/*physiology; Linear Models; Statistics, Nonparametric; Brain Injuries/*physiopathology/psychology; Cerebral Cortex/*physiology/physiopathology; Discrimination Learning/*physiology; Glasgow Coma Scale","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this  study, we investigated which brain areas show working memory dependent patterns in  subsequent baseline periods and how specific they are for the preceding experimental  condition. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, 94 subjects performed a  letter-version of the n-back task with the conditions 0-back and 2-back followed by  a low-level baseline in which subjects had to passively observe the letters  appearing. In a univariate analysis, 2-back served as control condition while  0-back, baseline after 0-back and baseline after 2-back were modeled as regressors  to test for activity changes between both baseline conditions. Additionally, we  tested, using Gaussian process classifiers, the recognition of task condition from  functional images acquired during baseline. Besides the expected activity changes in  the precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex, we found differential activity in the  thalamus, putamen, and postcentral gyrus that were affected by the preceding task.  The multivariate analysis revealed that images of the subsequent baseline block  contain task related patterns that yield a recognition rate of 70%.

However, studies with adult attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder  patients addressing this issue as well as the effects of clinically valid  methylphenidate treatment are scarce. This study contributes to closing this gap.  METHODS: Thirty-five adult patients were randomized to 6 weeks of double-blind  placebo or methylphenidate treatment. Patients completed an fMRI n-back working  memory task both before and after the assigned treatment, and matched healthy  controls were tested and compared to the untreated patients. RESULTS: There were no  whole-brain differences between any of the groups. However, when specified regions  of interest were investigated, the patient group showed enhanced BOLD responses in  dorsal and ventral areas before treatment. This increase was correlated with  performance across all participants and with attention deficit/hyperactivity  disorder symptoms in the patient group. Furthermore, we found an effect of treatment  in the right superior frontal gyrus, with methylphenidate-treated patients  exhibiting increased activation, which was absent in the placebo-treated patients.  CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate distinct activation differences between untreated  adult attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder patients and matched healthy controls  during a working memory task. These differences might reflect compensatory efforts  by the patients, who are performing at the same level as the healthy controls. We  furthermore found a positive effect of methylphenidate on the activation of a  frontal region of interest. These observations contribute to a more thorough  understanding of adult attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and provide impulses  for the evaluation of therapy-related changes.","2016-05-06","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","pyw049","","10","19","","Int J Neuropsychopharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2016.

The current study examined cognitive fatigue-related  functional connectivity among 26 pwMS and 14 demographically matched healthy  controls (HCs). Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)  scanning while performing a working memory task (n-back), with two conditions: one  with higher cognitive load (2-back) to induce fatigue and one with lower cognitive  load (0-back) as a control condition. Task-independent residual functional  connectivity was assessed, with seeds in brain regions previously implicated in  cognitive fatigue (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), ventromedial prefrontal  cortex (vmPFC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), insula, and striatum).  Cognitive fatigue was measured using the Visual Analogue Scale of Fatigue (VAS-F).  Results indicated that as VAS-F scores increased, HCs showed increased residual  functional connectivity between the striatum and the vmPFC (crucial in reward  processing) during the 2-back condition compared to the 0-back condition. In  contrast, pwMS displayed increased residual functional connectivity from  interoceptive hubs-the insula and the dACC-to the striatum. In conclusion, pwMS  showed a hyperconnectivity within the interoceptive network and disconnection within  the reward circuitry when experiencing cognitive fatigue.","2020-11-10","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","","","11","10","","Diagnostics (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 33182742  PMCID: PMC7696273","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\6LY5LW6Q\Chen et al. - 2020 - Cognitive Fatigue Is Associated with Altered Funct.pdf","","fMRI; functional connectivity; multiple sclerosis; neuroimaging; fatigue","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Overall, both WM conditions (1-BACK and 2-BACK)  activated a large network of regions throughout the brain, common to all groups.  However, voxel-wise and time-course analyses revealed significant functional group  differences, despite no significant behavioral performance differences. During  1-BACK, voxel-wise blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal activity was  significantly reduced in a number of regions from the WM network (inferior frontal  gyrus, anterior insula, caudate, putamen, and cerebellum) in pre-HD and symp-HD  groups, compared with controls; however, time-course analysis of the BOLD response  in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) showed increased activation in  symp-HD, compared with pre-HD and controls. The pattern of reduced voxel-wise BOLD  activity in pre-HD and symp-HD, relative to controls, became more pervasive during  2-BACK affecting the same structures as in 1-BACK, but also incorporated further WM  regions (anterior cingulate gyrus, parietal lobe and thalamus). The DLPFC BOLD  time-course for 2-BACK showed a reversed pattern to that observed in 1-BACK, with a  significantly diminished signal in symp-HD, relative to pre-HD and controls. Our  findings provide support for functional brain reorganisation in cortical and  subcortical regions in both pre-HD and symp-HD, which are modulated by task  difficulty.

The performance characteristics of the fMRI paradigm constrain experimental  power and may require different study designs (e.g., crossover vs. parallel groups),  yet fMRI reliability characteristics can be strongly dependent on the nature of the  fMRI task. The present study investigated both within-subject and group-level  reliability of a combined three-task fMRI battery targeting three systems of wide  applicability in clinical and cognitive neuroscience: an emotional (face matching),  a motivational (monetary reward anticipation) and a cognitive (n-back working  memory) task. A group of 25 young, healthy volunteers were scanned twice on a 3T MRI  scanner with a mean test-retest interval of 14.6 days. FMRI reliability was  quantified using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) applied at three  different levels ranging from a global to a localized and fine spatial scale: (1)  reliability of group-level activation maps over the whole brain and within targeted  regions of interest (ROIs); (2) within-subject reliability of ROI-mean amplitudes  and (3) within-subject reliability of individual voxels in the target ROIs. Results  showed robust evoked activation of all three tasks in their respective target  regions (emotional task=amygdala; motivational task=ventral striatum; cognitive  task=right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and parietal cortices) with high effect  sizes (ES) of ROI-mean summary values (ES=1.11-1.44 for the faces task, 0.96-1.43  for the reward task, 0.83-2.58 for the n-back task). Reliability of group level  activation was excellent for all three tasks with ICCs of 0.89-0.98 at the whole  brain level and 0.66-0.97 within target ROIs. Within-subject reliability of ROI-mean  amplitudes across sessions was fair to good for the reward task (ICCs=0.56-0.62)  and, dependent on the particular ROI, also fair-to-good for the n-back task  (ICCs=0.44-0.57) but lower for the faces task (ICC=-0.02-0.16). In conclusion, all  three tasks are well suited to between-subject designs, including imaging genetics.  When specific recommendations are followed, the n-back and reward task are also  suited for within-subject designs, including pharmaco-fMRI. The present study  provides task-specific fMRI reliability performance measures that will inform the  optimal use, powering and design of fMRI studies using comparable tasks.","2012-04-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1746-1758","","3","60","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, data on female athletes are limited. In the current investigation, we aimed  to (1) assess the longitudinal pre- to post-season changes in functional MRI (fMRI)  of working memory and working memory performance, (2) quantify the association  between the pre- to post-season change in fMRI of working memory and the exposure to  head impact and working memory performance, and (3) assess whether wearing a neck  collar designed to reduce intracranial slosh via mild compression of the jugular  veins can ameliorate the changes in fMRI brain activation observed in the female  high school athletes who did not wear collars after a full soccer season.

A significant pre- to post-season increase in fMRI blood oxygen level  dependent (BOLD) signal was demonstrated when performing the N-back working memory  task in the non-collar group but not in the collar group, despite the comparable  exposure to head impacts during the season between the two groups. The collar group  demonstrated significantly smaller pre- to post-season change in fMRI BOLD signal  than the non-collar group, suggesting a potential protective effect from the collar  device. Significant correlations were also found between the pre- to post-season  increase in fMRI brain activation and the decrease in task accuracy in the  non-collar group, indicating an association between the compensatory mechanism in  underlying neurophysiology and the alteration in the behavioral outcomes.","2018-06-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1248-1259","","11","35","","J Neurotrauma","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 29334834  PMCID: PMC6037185","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\65JTQ2DL\Yuan et al. - 2018 - Mild Jugular Compression Collar Ameliorated Change.pdf","","Humans; Female; Adolescent; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; *fMRI; *working memory; *Memory, Short-Term; *N-Back task; Longitudinal Studies; Prospective Studies; *neck collar; *Personal Protective Equipment; Jugular Veins; *female soccer athletes; *head impact; Athletic Injuries/*prevention & control; Brain Injuries, Traumatic/*prevention & control; Soccer/*injuries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used a visuo-spatial 'n-back' paradigm to  compare WM network activity in 38 unilateral hippocampal sclerosis (HS) patients (19  left) and 15 healthy controls. WM performance was impaired in both left and right HS  groups compared to controls. The TLE groups showed reduced right superior parietal  lobe activity during single- and multiple-item WM. No significant hippocampal  activation was found during the active task in any group, but the hippocampi  progressively deactivated as the task demand increased. This effect was bilateral  for controls, whereas the TLE patients showed progressive unilateral deactivation  only contralateral to the side of the hippocampal sclerosis and seizure focus.  Progressive deactivation of the posterior medial temporal lobe was associated with  better performance in all groups. Our results suggest that WM is impaired in  unilateral HS and the underlying neural correlates of WM are disrupted. Our findings  suggest that hippocampal activity is progressively suppressed as the WM load  increases, with maintenance of good performance. Implications for understanding the  role of the hippocampus in WM are discussed.","2012-04-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1696-1703","","3","60","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Abstinence (versus smoking) led to reduced accuracy, slower  median correct response time and reduced BOLD signal change in the three a priori  regions of interest: medial frontal/cingulate gyrus and right and left dorsolateral  prefrontal cortex. Significant age × session effects were found for BOLD signal  change in all three regions, as well as for withdrawal and craving; for all  measures, abstinence effects were attenuated in smokers aged ≥50 years compared with  those <50 years old.

To date, however, there is  little evidence directly linking these two sequelae of PKU. We utilized functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate prefrontal functioning in six  individuals with early-treated PKU (ETPKU) during performance of an n-back working  memory task and compared results with those of six age- and gender-matched  neurologically intact individuals. In addition, we evaluated the possible presence  of PKU-related disruptions in functional connectivity, as might be hypothesized  based on prior reports of white matter injury in individuals with ETPKU. A number of  brain regions, nearly half of which were located in the PFC, were found to show  atypical neural activity in individuals with ETPKU during working memory  performance. We also found decreased connectivity both within the PFC as well as  between the PFC and other brain regions in individuals with ETPKU compared with  controls. Results from this preliminary study suggest that both prefrontal  dysfunction and disruptions in functional connectivity may contribute to PKU-related  executive impairment. In addition to advancing our understanding of PKU, the current  findings have a broader impact in that PKU is regularly used as a model of early  prefrontal dysfunction in the study of other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g.,  autism).","2010","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","S33-40","","","99 Suppl 1","","Mol Genet Metab","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In this exploratory study  the effect of 20 weeks donepezil treatment on regional brain activity was measured  with fMRI in patients with mild AD. Twelve patients with probable AD and nine  age-matched controls were assessed with a Pyramids and Palm Trees semantic  association fMRI paradigm and an n-back working memory fMRI paradigm. In the patient  group only, the assessment was repeated after 20 weeks of treatment. After  treatment, differences from normal healthy elderly became more pronounced. There was  also a spread of deactivation which at retest was detectable in task relevant areas.  Behaviourally, however, there were no significant differences between group baseline  and retest scores, with a range of performance probably reflecting variation in drug  efficacy across patients. Parametric analyses established that increased behavioural  scores at retest correlated significantly with higher activation levels in non task  relevant areas. Behavioural stability with donepezil treatment was not paralleled by  the pattern of improved task specific brain activation reported in similar studies  of other ChEIs. This is arguably related to the different mechanisms of action of  the ChEIs and might be a clinical correlate of the reported synaptic upregulation  following long term donepezil treatment.","2010-08","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","415-427","","5","7","","Curr Alzheimer Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United Arab Emirates PMID: 20455867","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Middle Aged; Treatment Outcome; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Alzheimer Disease/*drug therapy/*metabolism; Brain/drug effects/*metabolism; Donepezil; Indans/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Piperidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Psychomotor Performance/drug effects/*physiology; Reaction Time/drug effects/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Examination of load effects revealed a DAT1xLoad interaction in the right  hemisphere in the caudate, our a priori region of interest. Exploratory analysis at  a more liberal threshold revealed this interaction in other basal ganglia regions  (putamen, and substantial nigra/subthalamic nuclei - SN/STN) and in medial parietal  cortex (left precuneus). The striatal and parietal regions were more activated in  9/10 carriers under high than low load, and DAT1 differences (9/10>10/10) were  evident only under high load. In contrast, SN/STN tended to be more activated in  10/10 carriers under low than high load and DAT1 differences (10/10>9/10) were  evident only under low load. Thus, 10-repeat homozygosity of DAT1 was associated  with reduced performance and a lack of increased basal ganglia involvement under  higher working memory demands.","2010-11-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","970-977","","3","53","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, its signaling appears to affect brain cognitive processing. Recent  findings highlight a crucial role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the mechanism of  intraneuronal CB1 signaling transduction, while others indicate that two single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs1406977 and rs20417) modulate expression of CB1  (CNR1) and COX-2 (PTGS2) coding genes, respectively. Here, our aim was to use fMRI  to investigate in healthy humans whether these SNPs interact in modulating  prefrontal activity during working memory processing and if this modulation is  linked with cannabis use. We recruited 242 healthy subjects genotyped for CNR1  rs1406977 and PTGS2 rs20417 that performed the N-back working memory task during  fMRI and were interviewed using the Cannabis Experience Questionnaire (CEQ). We  found that the interaction between CNR1 rs1406977 and PTGS2 rs20417 is associated  with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity such that specific genotype  configurations (CNR1 C carriers/PTGS2 C carriers and CNR1 TT/PTGS2 GG) predict lower  cortical response versus others in spite of similar behavioral accuracy.  Furthermore, DLPFC activity in the cluster associated with the CNR1 by PTGS2  interaction was negatively correlated with behavioral efficiency and positively  correlated with frequency of cannabis use in cannabis users. These results suggest  that a genetically modulated balancing of signaling within the CB1-COX-2 pathway may  reflect on more or less efficient patterns of prefrontal activity during working  memory. Frequency of cannabis use may be a factor for further modulation of  CNR1/PTGS2-mediated cortical processing associated with this cognitive process.","2016-08","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","231-238","","","81","","Cortex","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

These functional networks can be examined  during active conditions [i.e., task-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)]  and also in passive states (resting-fMRI), where the default mode network (DMN) is  the most widely investigated system. The role of the DMN remains unclear, although  it is known to be responsible for the shift between resting and focused attention  processing. There is also some evidence for its malleability in relation to previous  experience. Here we investigated brain connectivity patterns in 16 healthy young  subjects by using an n-back task with increasing levels of memory load within the  fMRI context. Prior to this working memory (WM) task, participants were trained  outside fMRI with a shortened test version. Immediately after, they underwent a  resting-state fMRI acquisition followed by the full fMRI n-back test. We observed  that the degree of intrinsic correlation within DMN and WM networks was maximal  during the most demanding n-back condition (3-back). Furthermore, individuals  showing a stronger negative correlation between the two networks under both  conditions exhibited better behavioural performance. Interestingly, and despite the  fact that we considered eight different resting-state fMRI networks previously  identified in humans, only the connectivity within the posteromedial parts of the  DMN (precuneus) prior to the fMRI n-back task predicted WM execution. Our results  using a data-driven probabilistic approach for fMRI analysis provide the first  evidence of a direct relationship between behavioural performance and the degree of  negative correlation between the DMN and WM networks. They further suggest that in  the context of expectancy for an imminent cognitive challenge, higher resting-state  activity in the posteromedial parietal cortex may be related to increased  attentional preparatory resources.","2012-10","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1187-1196","","9","48","","Cortex","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Srl.

In the present study we examined the effects of sleep deprivation (SD) whilst  parametrically varying working memory load using an n-back task. 20 right-handed  males performed the n-back task after a night of normal sleep (RW: rested  wakefulness) and after approximately 31 h of SD. Comparison of load responsive  cerebral activation identified two clusters where the parametric response was  altered after SD. In the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activity was reduced  at the most difficult working memory load, whereas in the right inferior parietal  lobe activity was increased at the simplest working memory load. The strength of  activation in both of these regions during RW predicted the response of those same  regions to SD. While the ability to predict signal change has previously been  demonstrated using behavioural measures, to our knowledge this is the first study to  show that the neuronal effects of SD can be predicted based upon activation during a  normal rested condition.","2012-07-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","62-70","","1","233","","Behav Brain Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The  decision for return-to-play is one of the most difficult responsibilities facing the  physician, and so far this decision has been based primarily on neurological  examination, symptom checklists, and neuropsychological (NP) testing. Functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may be an additional, more objective tool to  assess the severity and recovery of function after concussion. The purpose of this  study was to define neural correlates of SRC during the 2 months after injury in  varsity contact sport athletes who suffered a SRC. All athletes were scanned as they  performed an n-back task, for n=1, 2, 3. Subjects were scanned within 72 hours  (session one), at 2 weeks (session two), and 2 months (session three) post-injury.  Compared with age and sex matched normal controls, concussed subjects demonstrated  persistent, significantly increased activation for the 2 minus 1 n-back contrast in  bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in all three sessions and in the  inferior parietal lobe in session one and two (α≤0.01 corrected). Measures of task  performance revealed no significant differences between concussed versus control  groups at any of the three time points with respect to any of the three n-back  tasks. These findings suggest that functional brain activation differences persist  at 2 months after injury in concussed athletes, despite the fact that their  performance on a standard working memory task is comparable to normal controls and  normalization of clinical and NP test results. These results might indicate a delay  between neural and behaviorally assessed recovery after SRC.","2014-01-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","180-188","","2","31","","J Neurotrauma","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 23914845  PMCID: PMC3900041","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\R4IVDUDC\Dettwiler et al. - 2014 - Persistent differences in patterns of brain activa.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Young Adult; Follow-Up Studies; Time Factors; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Brain/*physiopathology; Athletes/*psychology; Athletic Injuries/*physiopathology/psychology; Brain Concussion/etiology/*physiopathology; Functional Neuroimaging/instrumentation/*methods; Trauma Severity Indices","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Responsiveness (modulation of fMRI signal  by increasing load) has been linked directly to successful cognitive task  performance in external-task-positive regions but not in DMN regions. To investigate  whether a responsive DMN is required for successful cognitive performance, we  compared healthy human subjects (n = 23) with individuals shown to have decreased  DMN engagement (chronic pain patients, n = 28). Subjects performed a multilevel  working-memory task (N-back) during fMRI. If a responsive DMN is required for  successful performance, patients having reduced DMN responsiveness should show  worsened performance; if performance is not reduced, their brains should show  compensatory activation in external-task-positive regions or elsewhere. All subjects  showed decreased accuracy and increased reaction times with increasing task level,  with no significant group differences on either measure at any level. Patients had  significantly reduced negative fMRI response (deactivation) of DMN regions  (posterior cingulate/precuneus, medial prefrontal cortex). Controls showed expected  modulation of DMN deactivation with increasing task difficulty. Patients showed  significantly reduced modulation of DMN deactivation by task difficulty, despite  their successful task performance. We found no evidence of compensatory neural  recruitment in external-task-positive regions or elsewhere. Individual  responsiveness of the external-task-positive ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, but  not of DMN regions, correlated with task accuracy. These findings suggest that a  responsive DMN may not be required for successful cognitive performance; a  responsive external-task-positive network may be sufficient. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT:  We studied the relationship between responsiveness of the brain to increasing task  demand and successful cognitive performance, using chronic pain patients as a probe.  fMRI working memory studies show that two main cognitive networks [""external-task  positive"" and ""default-mode network"" (DMN)] are responsive to increasing task  difficulty. The responsiveness of both of these brain networks is suggested to be  required for successful task performance. The responsiveness of  external-task-positive regions has been linked directly to successful cognitive task  performance, as we also show here. However, pain patients show decreased engagement  and responsiveness of the DMN but can perform a working memory task as well as  healthy subjects, without demonstrable compensatory neural recruitment. Therefore, a  responsive DMN might not be needed for successful cognitive performance.","2015-08-19","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","11595-11605","","33","35","","J Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 the authors 0270-6474/15/3511596-11$15.00/0.","","","","","","PMID: 26290236  PMCID: PMC4540797","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\4FUM5QUM\Čeko et al. - 2015 - Is a Responsive Default Mode Network Required for .pdf","","Humans; Female; Adult; Middle Aged; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain/*physiopathology; working memory; *Memory, Short-Term; *Cognition; FMRI; task performance; Nerve Net/*physiopathology; Memory Disorders/etiology/*physiopathology; *Task Performance and Analysis; chronic pain; Chronic Pain/complications/physiopathology; Cognitive Reserve; default mode; external-task-positive","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is limited evidence of different  functional network alterations associated with this clinical executive dysfunction.  This study investigates working memory deficits in children with TLE by assessing  deactivation of the default mode network (DMN) on functional Magnetic Resonance  Imaging (fMRI) and the relationship of DMN deactivation with fMRI behavioral  findings and neuropsychological test performance. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: fMRI was  conducted on 15 children with TLE and 15 healthy controls (age: 8-16 years) while  performing the N-back task in order to assess deactivation of the DMN. N-back  accuracy, N-back reaction time, and neuropsychological tests of executive function  (Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System [D-KEFS] Color-Word Interference and Card  Sort tests) were also assessed. PRINCIPAL OBSERVATIONS: During the N-back task,  children with TLE exhibited significantly less deactivation of the DMN, primarily in  the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex compared with controls. These alterations  significantly correlated with N-back behavioral findings and D-KEFS results.  CONCLUSIONS: Children with TLE exhibit executive dysfunction which correlates with  DMN alterations. These findings suggest that the level of deactivation of specific  functional networks may contribute to cognitive impairment in children with TLE.

Studies of functional connectivity have been instrumental in  extending such notions to humans but, so far, have almost exclusively focussed on  pharmacological agents with a predominant dopaminergic mechanism of action. Here, we  investigate the effect of a single dose of atomoxetine 60mg, a noradrenaline  transporter inhibitor, on working memory performance and associated functional  connectivity during an n-back task in 19 healthy male volunteers. Atomoxetine  increased functional connectivity between right anterior insula and dorsolateral  prefrontal cortex, precentral gyrus, posterior parietal cortex and precuneus during  the high-working memory load condition of the n-back task. Increased  atomoxetine-induced insula-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex functional connectivity  during this condition correlated with decreased reaction time variability and was  furthermore predicted by working memory capacity. These results show for the first  time that noradrenaline transporter blockade-induced increases in cortical  catecholamines accentuate fronto-parietal working memory-related network integrity.  The observation of significant inter-subject variability in response to atomoxetine  has implications for inverted-U frameworks of dopamine and noradrenaline function,  which could be useful to predict drug effects in clinical disorders with variable  treatment response.","2017-04","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","399-410","","4","27","","Eur Neuropsychopharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

Neuronal activation during WM tasks can be  indirectly assessed by blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance  imaging (BOLD-fMRI). The purpose of this study was to describe BOLD-fMRI responses  during 2 separate working memory tasks and a finger tapping task in men with OSA. A  secondary aim was to explore the possible relation between OSA severity  (apnea/hypopnea index) and BOLD-fMRI signal patterns. METHODS: Nine treatment-naïve  men (mean age [+/- SD] of 45.7 [+/- 6.6] years) with OSA underwent BOLD fMRI testing  on a research-dedicated university-based MRI scanner. During BOLD-fMRI subjects  performed a Paced Auditory Serial Addition task (PASAT), an auditory N-Back task  (2-BACK) task, and an alternating finger tapping. RESULTS: PASAT and 2-BACK tasks  produced similar patterns of increased bilateral activation in posterior parietal,  prefrontal and cerebellar regions. BOLD signal deactivations were observed within  posterior cingulate, retrosplenial and inferior frontal regions during PASAT and  2-BACK, but not during tapping. With increased disease severity, BOLD activation  patterns were increased in the right parietal lobe, but decreased in the cerebellar  vermis. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings suggest that the severity of OSA may  correlate with neural activation during tasks of working memory, potentially  reflecting compensatory neural responses in severe disease.","2009-02-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","21-27","","1","5","","J Clin Sleep Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 19317377  PMCID: PMC2637162","","","","Humans; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Neuropsychological Tests; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Arousal/physiology; Brain/*physiopathology; Prefrontal Cortex/physiopathology; Gyrus Cinguli/physiopathology; Parietal Lobe/physiopathology; Oxygen/*blood; Attention/physiology; Frontal Lobe/physiopathology; Polysomnography; Dominance, Cerebral/physiology; Cerebellum/physiopathology; Motor Activity/physiology; Problem Solving/physiology; Serial Learning/physiology; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive/diagnosis/*physiopathology; Synaptic Transmission/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The drug group, compared with placebo group, exhibited  improvement or stabilization in memory measures over time. Analyses of fMRI revealed  that the placebo group exhibited higher activation magnitude and spatial extents at  left superior parietal lobule; importantly, the greater activation identified in  placebo group was related to more decline in the digit span.

Here, we examine in 171 adults (aged  20-94 years) the effects of age on dynamic modulation of blood oxygenation-level  dependent activation to difficulty in parametrically increasing working memory (WM)  load (0-, 2-, 3-, and 4-back conditions). First, we examined parametric increases  and decreases in activation to increasing WM load (positive modulation effect and  negative modulation effect). Second, we examined the effect of age on modulation to  difficulty (WM load) to identify regions that differed with age as difficulty  increased (age-related positive and negative modulation effects). Weakened  modulation to difficulty with age was found in both the positive modulation (middle  frontal, superior/inferior parietal) and negative modulation effect (deactivated)  regions (insula, cingulate, medial superior frontal, fusiform, and parahippocampal  gyri, hippocampus, and lateral occipital cortex). Age-related alterations to  positive modulation emerged later in the lifespan than negative modulation.  Furthermore, these effects were significantly coupled in that greater upmodulation  was associated with lesser downmodulation. Importantly, greater fronto-parietal  upmodulation to difficulty and greater downmodulation of deactivated regions were  associated with better task accuracy and upmodulation with better WM span measured  outside the scanner. These findings suggest that greater dynamic range of modulation  of activation to cognitive challenge is in service of current task performance, as  well as generalizing to cognitive ability beyond the scanner task, lending support  to its utility as a marker of successful cognitive aging.","2017-12","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","153-163","","","60","","Neurobiol Aging","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Behavioral findings have suggested that acute aerobic exercise improves children's  working memory; however, there is still very little knowledge about whether a single  session of aerobic exercise can alter working memory's brain activation patterns, as  assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Therefore, we investigated  the effect of acute moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on working memory and its  brain activation patterns in preadolescent children, and further explored the neural  basis of acute aerobic exercise on working memory in these children. We used a  within-subjects design with a counterbalanced order. Nine healthy, right-handed  children were scanned with a Siemens MAGNETOM Trio 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance  imaging scanner while they performed a working memory task (N-back task), following  a baseline session and a 30-min, moderate-intensity exercise session. Compared with  the baseline session, acute moderate-intensity aerobic exercise benefitted  performance in the N-back task, increasing brain activities of bilateral parietal  cortices, left hippocampus, and the bilateral cerebellum. These data extend the  current knowledge by indicating that acute aerobic exercise enhances children's  working memory, and the neural basis may be related to changes in the working  memory's brain activation patterns elicited by acute aerobic exercise.","2016","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1804","","","7","","Front Psychol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 27917141  PMCID: PMC5116552","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\HZD7FWEY\Chen et al. - 2016 - Neural Basis of Working Memory Enhancement after A.pdf","","fMRI; working memory; N-back; acute aerobic exercise; brain activation patterns; preadolescent children","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A group of eight subjects took part in  modified versions of the N-back and Sternberg working memory paradigms.  Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data were recorded, and subsequently processed using  beamformer based source imaging methodology. Our study shows statistically  significant increases in θ oscillations during both N-back and Sternberg tasks.  These oscillations were shown to originate in the medial frontal cortex, and further  to scale with memory load. We have also shown that increases in θ oscillations are  accompanied by decreases in β and γ band oscillations at the same spatial  coordinate. These decreases were most prominent in the 20-40 Hz frequency range,  although spectral analysis showed that γ band power decrease extends up to at least  80 Hz. β/γ Power decrease also scales with memory load. Whilst θ increases were  predominately observed in the medial frontal cortex, β/γ decreases were associated  with other brain areas, including nodes of the default mode network (for the N-back  task) and areas associated with language processing (for the Sternberg task). These  observations are in agreement with intracranial EEG and fMRI studies. Finally, we  have shown an intimate relationship between changes in β/γ band oscillatory power at  spatially separate network nodes, implying that activity in these nodes is not  reflective of uni-modal task driven changes in spatially separate brain regions, but  rather represents correlated network activity. The utility of MEG as a non-invasive  means to measure neural oscillatory modulation has been demonstrated and future  studies employing this technology have the potential to gain a better understanding  of neural oscillatory processes, their relationship to functional and effective  connectivity, and their correspondence to BOLD fMRI.","2011-04-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1804-1815","","4","55","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, a comparison of the motion correction tools provided by several leading fMRI  analysis software packages was performed, including AFNI, AIR, BrainVoyager, FSL,  and SPM2. Comparisons were performed using data from typical human studies as well  as phantom data. The identical reconstruction, preprocessing, and analysis steps  were used on every data set, except that motion correction was performed using  various configurations from each software package. Each package was studied using  default parameters, as well as parameters optimized for speed and accuracy. Forty  subjects performed a Go/No-go task (an event-related design that investigates  inhibitory motor response) and an N-back task (a block-design paradigm investigating  working memory). The human data were analyzed by extracting a set of general linear  model (GLM)-derived activation results and comparing the effect of motion correction  on thresholded activation cluster size and maximum t value. In addition, a series of  simulated phantom data sets were created with known activation locations,  magnitudes, and realistic motion. Results from the phantom data indicate that AFNI  and SPM2 yield the most accurate motion estimation parameters, while AFNI's  interpolation algorithm introduces the least smoothing. AFNI is also the fastest of  the packages tested. However, these advantages did not produce noticeably better  activation results in motion-corrected data from typical human fMRI experiments.  Although differences in performance between packages were apparent in the human  data, no single software package produced dramatically better results than the  others. The ""accurate"" parameters showed virtually no improvement in cluster t  values compared to the standard parameters. While the ""fast"" parameters did not  result in a substantial increase in speed, they did not degrade the cluster results  very much either. The phantom and human data indicate that motion correction can be  a valuable step in the data processing chain, yielding improvements of up to 20% in  the magnitude and up to 100% in the cluster size of detected activations, but the  choice of software package does not substantially affect this improvement.","2005-11-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","529-543","","3","28","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16099178","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\EZSBP42J\Oakes et al. - 2005 - Comparison of fMRI motion correction software tool.pdf","","Humans; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Oxygen/blood; Brain/*physiology; Memory, Short-Term/physiology; Linear Models; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/*statistics & numerical data; Models, Neurological; Artifacts; *Software; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*statistics & numerical data; Movement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fifty-five patients with  clinical diagnosis of exhaustion disorder were administered the n-back task during  fMRI scanning at baseline. Ten patients completed a 12-week cognitive training  intervention, as an addition to stress rehabilitation. Eleven patients served as a  treatment-as-usual control group. At baseline, burnout level was positively  associated with neural activation in the rostral prefrontal cortex, the posterior  parietal cortex and the striatum, primarily in the 2-back condition. Following  stress rehabilitation, the striatal activity decreased as a function of improved  levels of burnout. No significant association between burnout level and working  memory performance was found, however, our findings indicate that frontostriatal  neural responses related to working memory were modulated by burnout severity. We  suggest that patients with high levels of burnout need to recruit additional  cognitive resources to uphold task performance. Following cognitive training,  increased neural activation was observed during 3-back in working memory-related  regions, including the striatum, however, low sample size limits any firm  conclusions.","2017-11-30","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","17-25","","","269","","Psychiatry Res Neuroimaging","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

High rates of smoking among schizophrenic patients may reflect an effort to  remediate cognitive dysfunction. Our primary aim was to determine whether nicotine  improves cognitive function by facilitating activation of brain regions mediating  task performance or by facilitating functional connectivity. METHODS: Thirteen  smokers with schizophrenia and 13 smokers with no mental illness were withdrawn from  tobacco and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning twice,  once after placement of a placebo patch and once after placement of a nicotine  patch. During scanning, subjects performed an n-back task with two levels of working  memory load and of selective attention load. RESULTS: During the most difficult  (dichotic 2-back) task condition, nicotine improved performance of schizophrenic  subjects and worsened performance of control subjects. Nicotine also enhanced  activation of a network of regions, including anterior cingulate cortex and  bilateral thalamus, and modulated thalamocortical functional connectivity to a  greater degree in schizophrenic than in control subjects during dichotic 2-back task  performance.

The effects of small movements can be ameliorated during data  postprocessing, but data associated with severe movement is frequently discarded. In  discarding these data, it is often assumed that head-movement is a source of random  error, and that data can be discarded from subjects with severe movement without  biasing the sample. We tested this assumption by examining whether head movement was  related to task difficulty and cognitive status among persons with multiple  sclerosis (MS). Thirty-four persons with MS were scanned while performing a working  memory task with three levels of difficulty (the N-back task). Maximum movement  (angle, shift) was estimated for each difficulty level. Cognitive status was  assessed by combining performance on a working memory and processing speed task. An  interaction was found between task difficulty and cognitive status (high vs. low  cognitive ability): there was a linear increase in movement as task difficulty  increased that was larger among subjects with lower cognitive ability. Analyses of  the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) confirmed that increases in movement degraded data  quality. Similar, though far smaller, effects were found in a cohort of healthy  control (HC) subjects. Therefore, discarding data with severe movement artifact may  bias MS samples such that only those with less-severe cognitive impairment are  included in the analyses. However, even if such data are not discarded outright,  subjects who move more (MS and HC) will contribute less to the group-level results  because of degraded SNR.","2014-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1-13","","1","35","","Hum Brain Mapp","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","","","","PMID: 22847906  PMCID: PMC3881195","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\WUNWIBPD\Wylie et al. - 2014 - Functional magnetic resonance imaging movers and s.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; fMRI; Memory, Short-Term; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; multiple sclerosis; *Artifacts; *Movement; Bias; Cognition Disorders/diagnosis/etiology; head movement; Multiple Sclerosis/*complications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Thirty-three euthymic bipolar patients with  preserved memory and executive function and 28 euthymic bipolar patients with  significant memory and/or executive impairment, as defined using two test batteries,  the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT) and the Behavioural Assessment of the  Dysexecutive Syndrome (BADS), plus 28 healthy controls underwent structural MRI  using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Twenty-seven of the cognitively preserved  patients, 23 of the cognitively impaired patients and 28 controls also underwent  fMRI during performance of the n-back working memory task. RESULTS: No clusters of  grey or white matter volume difference were found between the two patient groups.  During n-back performance, the cognitively impaired patients showed hypoactivation  compared to the cognitively preserved patients in a circumscribed region in the  right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Both patient groups showed failure of  de-activation in the medial frontal cortex compared to the healthy controls.

In  addition to classical analyses investigating regional activity, the authors examined  functional connectivity of the brain regions critical to working memory performance  using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses. MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS:  Patients with TBI made a greater percentage of errors than controls at high working  memory load conditions. The fMRI data showed that the activation of the left  inferior parietal gyrus (LIPG) was significantly reduced, whereas the activation of  the right inferior frontal gyrus (RIFG) was significantly increased in patients  compared with controls. Task performance accuracy was significantly associated with  the activation of the LIPG in controls and the activation of the RIFG in patients.  PPI analyses on fMRI data further suggested that the functional connectivity between  the RIFG and LIPG was compromised in patients. CONCLUSION: The abnormal functional  connectivity between LIPG and RIFG may underlie the observed working memory deficits  and abnormal brain activation pattern in patients.","2011","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1170-1187","","12","25","","Brain Inj","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 21932994","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Neuropsychological Tests; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; *Memory, Short-Term; Task Performance and Analysis; Analysis of Variance; Memory Disorders/diagnosis/etiology/*physiopathology; Brain Injuries/complications/diagnosis/*physiopathology; Frontal Lobe/injuries/*physiopathology; Parietal Lobe/injuries/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Voxel-based analyses of brain  activations and deactivations were carried out and compared between groups. The  connectivity of regions of significant difference between the patients and controls  was also examined. RESULTS: The first-episode patients did not show significant  prefrontal hypo- or hyperactivation compared to controls. However, they showed  failure of deactivation in the medial frontal cortex.

The neural basis of such deficits  and its relationship with genetic risk remain unclear. We utilized functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural activity in samples of  bipolar disorder patients and their unaffected first-degree relatives while  performing working memory tasks of increasing difficulty. METHODS: Twenty remitted  bipolar I disorder patients, 20 of their unaffected first-degree relatives, and 20  healthy volunteers were recruited and successfully completed scanning. Subjects  participated in fMRI scans consisting of an n-back working memory task with three  stages of increasing difficulty (1-back, 2-back, and 3-back), alternating with a  baseline attention task. Groups were analyzed separately to produce brain activation  maps, and a group-by-task analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc comparisons was  completed. RESULTS: Patients performed more poorly online than control subjects and  relatives on the 2-back and 3-back tasks. The group-by-task ANOVA demonstrated a  significantly altered region of neural activity involving a cluster located in the  left frontal pole/ventrolateral gyrus. Post hoc analyses demonstrated that this  cluster was accounted for by significantly greater activation in relatives compared  with control subjects for the 2-back task. Patients demonstrated a trend to  significantly greater activation than control subjects in the same cluster during  1-back performance.

Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings  offer the possibility to greatly enrich the significance and the interpretation of  the single modality results because the same neural processes are observed from the  same brain at the same time. Nonetheless, the different physical nature of the  measured signals by the two techniques renders the coupling not always  straightforward, especially in cognitive experiments where spatially localized and  distributed effects coexist and evolve temporally at different temporal scales. The  purpose of this article is to illustrate the combination of simultaneously recorded  EEG and fMRI signals exploiting the principles of EEG distributed source modeling.  We define a common source space for fMRI and EEG signal projection and gather a  conceptually unique framework for the spatial and temporal comparative analysis. We  illustrate this framework in a graded-load working-memory simultaneous EEG-fMRI  experiment based on the n-back task where sustained load-dependent changes in the  blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signals during continuous item memorization  co-occur with parametric changes in the EEG theta power induced at each single item.  In line with previous studies, we demonstrate on two single-subject cases how the  presented approach is capable of colocalizing in midline frontal regions two  phenomena simultaneously observed at different temporal scales, such as the  sustained negative changes in BOLD activity and the parametric EEG theta  synchronization. We discuss the presented approach in relation to modeling and  interpretation issues typically arising in simultaneous EEG-fMRI studies.","2009-10","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1120-1130","","8","27","","Magn Reson Imaging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 19261423","","","","Humans; Male; Adult; Sensitivity and Specificity; Computer Simulation; Brain Mapping/*methods; Electroencephalography/*methods; Reproducibility of Results; Pattern Recognition, Visual/*physiology; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/methods; *Models, Neurological; Evoked Potentials, Visual/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/instrumentation/*methods; Visual Cortex/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present  study tested whether source estimation of scalp-recorded event-related potentials  (ERPs) can be used to investigate task-dependent AC activations. Subjects were  presented with frequency-varying two-part tones during pitch discrimination, pitch  n-back memory, and visual tasks identical to our previous fMRI study (Rinne et al.,  J Neurosci 29:13338-13343, 2009). ERPs and their minimum-norm source estimates in AC  were strongly modulated by task at 200-700 ms from tone onset. As in the fMRI study,  the pitch discrimination and pitch memory tasks were associated with distinct AC  activation patterns. In the pitch discrimination task, increased activity in the  anterior AC was detected relatively late at 300-700 ms from tone onset. Therefore,  this activity was probably not associated with enhanced pitch processing but rather  with the actual discrimination process (comparison between the two parts of tone).  Increased activity in more posterior areas associated with the pitch memory task, in  turn, occurred at 200-700 ms suggesting that this activity was related to operations  on pitch categories after pitch analysis was completed. Finally, decreased activity  associated with the pitch memory task occurred at 150-300 ms consistent with the  notion that, in the demanding pitch memory task, spectrotemporal analysis is  actively halted as soon as category information has been obtained. These results  demonstrate that ERP source analysis can be used to complement fMRI to investigate  task-dependent activations of human AC.","2015-05","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","445-458","","3","28","","Brain Topogr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 24043402","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\RK8PHVTR\Talja et al. - 2015 - Source analysis of event-related potentials during.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Young Adult; Neuropsychological Tests; Photic Stimulation; Memory/*physiology; Electroencephalography; Visual Perception/physiology; Acoustic Stimulation/methods; Evoked Potentials/*physiology; Pitch Perception/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The neural correlates of working memory  may be a neurocognitive endophenotype of OCD. METHODS: Forty-three unmedicated OCD  patients, 17 unaffected siblings, and 37 matched comparison subjects performed a  visuospatial n-back task, with a baseline condition (N0) and three working memory  load levels (N1, N2, N3) during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Task-related  brain activity was compared between groups in frontoparietal regions of interest.  Generalized psychophysiological interaction analyses were used to study task-related  changes in functional connectivity. RESULTS: Obsessive-compulsive disorder patients,  compared with comparison subjects and siblings, showed increased error rates at N3.  Compared with comparison subjects, OCD patients showed task-related hyperactivation  in left dorsal frontal areas and left precuneus associated with better task  performance. Siblings exhibited hyperactivation in a bilateral frontoparietal  network. Increased task load was associated with increased task-related brain  activity, but in OCD patients and siblings this increase was smaller from load N2 to  N3 than in comparison subjects. Obsessive-compulsive disorder patients, compared  with siblings and comparison subjects, showed increased task-related functional  connectivity between frontal regions and bilateral amygdala. CONCLUSIONS: These  findings indicate that compensatory frontoparietal brain activity in OCD patients  and their unaffected relatives preserves task performance at low task loads but is  insufficient to maintain performance at high task loads. Frontoparietal dysfunction  may constitute a neurocognitive endophenotype for OCD, possibly reflecting limbic  interference with and neural inefficiency within the frontoparietal network.","2014-12-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","878-887","","11","76","","Biol Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","© 2013 Society of Biological Psychiatry Published by Society of Biological Psychiatry All rights reserved.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 24365484","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Brain Mapping; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; fMRI; working memory; n-back; Endophenotypes; Frontal Lobe/*physiopathology; Parietal Lobe/*physiopathology; frontoparietal; Endophenotype; obsessive-compulsive disorder; Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder/*physiopathology; Siblings; Spatial Memory/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eighteen patients with severe TBI and 14 healthy controls matched for age  and gender were included in the study. TBI patients were selected according to signs  of diffuse axonal injury on computed tomography (CT) and without any evidence of  focal lesions on MRI clinical examination. Functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) was  used to assess brain activation during n-back tasks (0-, 2-, and 3-back). Compared  to controls, the TBI group showed significant working memory impairment on the  Digits Backwards (p=0.022) and Letter-Number Sequencing subtests from the WAIS-III  (p<0.001) under the 2-back (p=0.008) and 3-back (p=0.017) conditions. Both groups  engaged bilateral fronto-parietal regions known to be involved in working memory,  although patients showed less cerebral activation than did controls. Decreased  activation in TBI patients compared to controls was observed mainly in the right  superior and middle frontal cortex. The correlation patterns differed between  patients and controls: while the control group showed a negative correlation between  performance and activation in prefrontal cortex (PFC), TBI patients presented a  positive correlation in right parietal and left parahippocampus for the low and high  working memory load, respectively. In conclusion, severe TBI patients with diffuse  brain damage show a pattern of cerebral hypoactivation in the right middle and  superior frontal regions during working memory tasks, and also present an impaired  pattern of performance correlations.","2008-05","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","479-494","","5","25","","J Neurotrauma","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18363509","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\8Q2ZFSQG\Sánchez-Carrión et al. - 2008 - Frontal hypoactivation on functional magnetic reso.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; *Brain Mapping; Memory/*physiology; Diffuse Axonal Injury/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared with  controls, participants with ADHD under placebo showed increased functional  connectivity within fronto-parietal and auditory networks, and decreased functional  connectivity within the executive control network. MPH normalized the altered  functional connectivity pattern and significantly enhanced functional connectivity  within the executive control network, though in non-overlapping areas.

First, intelligence tests were performed using Chinese  Wechsler Young Children Scales of Intelligence in PNE children and controls. The  full intelligence quotient (FIQ), verbal IQ (VIQ), performance IQ (PIQ) and  memory/caution (M/C) factor were measured. After intelligence tests, event-related  fMRI scans were performed using the categorical N-Back working memory task on a 3.0T  MR scanner. The percent of correct responses (PCR) and the mean reaction time to  correct response (mRT) were recorded and compared; fMRI data were analysed using  SPM2, the differences in activation were compared with the single subject and  between-group levels. RESULTS: The FIQ, VIQ and PIQ in the PNE group were within the  normal range and did not significantly differ from the control group (P > 0.05). The  M/C factor was statistically significantly lower in the PNE group (P < 0.05). In the  N-Back test, PNE children had lower PCR and longer mRT than controls (P < 0.05).

Abnormal brain activation during cognitive processing has been reported, both in  task-positive and task-negative networks. Further, structural cortical and  subcortical brain abnormalities have been documented, but little is known about how  task-related brain activation is associated with brain anatomy in SZ compared to  healthy controls (HC). Utilizing linked independent component analysis (LICA), a  data-driven multimodal analysis approach, we investigated structure-function  associations in a large sample of SZ (n = 96) and HC (n = 142). We tested for  associations between task-positive (fronto-parietal) and task-negative  (default-mode) brain networks derived from fMRI activation during an n-back working  memory task, and brain structural measures of surface area, cortical thickness, and  gray matter volume, and to what extent these associations differed in SZ compared to  HC. A significant association (p < .05, corrected for multiple comparisons) was  found between a component reflecting the task-positive fronto-parietal network and  another component reflecting cortical thickness in fronto-temporal brain regions in  SZ, indicating increased activation with increased thickness. Other  structure-function associations across, between and within groups were generally  moderate and significant at a nominal p-level only, with more numerous and stronger  associations in SZ compared to HC. These results indicate a complex pattern of  moderate associations between brain activation during cognitive processing and brain  morphometry, and extend previous findings of fronto-temporal brain abnormalities in  SZ by suggesting a coupling between cortical thickness of these brain regions and  working memory-related brain activation.","2015","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","253-263","","","9","","Neuroimage Clin","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 26509112  PMCID: PMC4576364","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\63FGZJPR\Brandt et al. - 2015 - Assessing brain structural associations with worki.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Young Adult; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Brain Mapping; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Schizophrenic Psychology; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Reaction Time/physiology; Brain/*pathology; Schizophrenia; Models, Neurological; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Default-mode; Fronto-parietal; Linked independent component analysis; Neural Pathways/blood supply/*pathology; Principal Component Analysis; Schizophrenia/*pathology/*physiopathology; Structure–function","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ongoing or past  medications, co-morbidity and differences in task performance are potential,  independent confounds in assessing the integrity of cerebral patterns in ADHD. In  the present study, we recorded WM-related cerebral activity during a memory updating  N-back task using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in control children  and never medicated, prepubescent children with ADHD but without comorbid symptoms.  Despite similar updating performance than controls, children with ADHD exhibited  decreased, below baseline WM-related activation levels in a widespread  cortico-subcortical network encompassing bilateral occipital and inferior parietal  areas, caudate nucleus, cerebellum and functionally connected brainstem nuclei.  Distinctive functional connectivity patterns were also found in the ADHD in these  regions, with a tighter coupling in the updating than in the control condition with  a distributed WM-related cerebral network. Especially, cerebellum showed tighter  coupling with activity in an area compatible with the brainstem red nucleus. These  results in children with clinical core symptoms of ADHD but without comorbid  affections and never treated with medication yield evidence for a core functional  neuroanatomical network subtending WM-related processes in ADHD, which may  participate to the pathophysiology and expression of clinical symptoms.","2012","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","e49392","","11","7","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 23166657  PMCID: PMC3498108","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\EASJVPZX\Massat et al. - 2012 - Working memory-related functional brain patterns i.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Child; Brain Mapping; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain/*physiology; Executive Function/*physiology; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*physiopathology; Belgium","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As yet, however, the mechanisms by which interference  operates remain elusive. A better knowledge of these processes may facilitate our  understanding of the effects of attention on human performance and the debilitating  consequences that disruptions to attention can have. According to the load theory of  cognitive control, processing of task-irrelevant stimuli is increased by attending  in parallel to a relevant task with high cognitive demands. This is due to the  relevant task engaging cognitive control resources that are, hence, unavailable to  inhibit the processing of task-irrelevant stimuli. However, it has also been  demonstrated that a variety of types of load (perceptual and emotional) can result  in a reduction of the processing of task-irrelevant stimuli, suggesting a uniform  effect of increased load irrespective of the type of load. In the present study, we  concurrently presented a relevant auditory matching task [n-back working memory  (WM)] of low or high cognitive load (1-back or 2-back WM) and task-irrelevant images  at one of three object visibility levels (0%, 50%, or 100%). fMRI activation during  the processing of the task-irrelevant visual stimuli was measured in the lateral  occipital cortex and found to be reduced under high, compared to low, WM load. In  combination with previous findings, this result is suggestive of a more generalized  load theory, whereby cognitive load, as well as other types of load (e.g.,  perceptual), can result in a reduction of the processing of task-irrelevant stimuli,  in line with a uniform effect of increased load irrespective of the type of load.","2010-03","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","437-446","","3","22","","J Cogn Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 19302005","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\VZTEUTJM\Klemen et al. - 2010 - Auditory working memory load impairs visual ventra.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Young Adult; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Visual Perception/*physiology; Cognition; Attention/physiology; Auditory Perception/*physiology; Occipital Lobe/physiology; Inhibition, Psychological; Visual Pathways/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RESULTS: The BOLD activation pattern in the preterm  group involved the same areas (cingulate, prefrontal, and parietal cortexes), but  all areas displayed significantly less activation than those in the control group,  particularly when the cognitive load was increased. The RA results corresponded with  the activation data in that the preterm group had significantly fewer correct  responses. No group difference was found regarding RTs.

Acute HSV-1 encephalitis is rare and definitive  evidence of latent infection in the brain is lacking. However, exposure untraceable  to encephalitis has been repeatedly associated with impaired working memory and  executive functions, particularly among schizophrenia patients. METHODS: Patterns of  HSV-1 infection and gene expression changes were examined in human induced  pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. Separately, differences in blood  oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses to working memory challenges using  letter n-back tests were investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging  (fMRI) among schizophrenia cases/controls. RESULTS: HSV-1 induced lytic changes in  iPSC-derived glutamatergic neurons and neuroprogenitor cells. In neurons, HSV-1 also  entered a quiescent state following coincubation with antiviral drugs, with  distinctive changes in gene expression related to functions such as glutamatergic  signaling. In the fMRI studies, main effects of schizophrenia (P = .001) and HSV-1  exposure (1-back, P = 1.76 × 10(-4); 2-back, P = 1.39 × 10(-5)) on BOLD responses  were observed. We also noted increased BOLD responses in the frontoparietal,  thalamus, and midbrain regions among HSV-1 exposed schizophrenia cases and controls,  compared with unexposed persons. CONCLUSIONS: The lytic/quiescent cycles in  iPSC-derived neurons indicate that persistent neuronal infection can occur, altering  cellular function. The fMRI studies affirm the associations between nonencephalitic  HSV-1 infection and functional brain changes linked with working memory impairment.  The fMRI and iPSC studies together provide putative mechanisms for the cognitive  impairments linked to HSV-1 exposure.","2015-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","123-132","","1","41","","Schizophr Bull","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2014.

For example, it is unclear whether  intrinsic activity can also predict task-evoked deactivation and whether the  rest-task relationship is dependent on task load. In this study, we addressed these  issues on 40 healthy control subjects using resting-state and task-driven [N-back  working memory (WM) task] functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected in  the same session. Using amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) as an index of  intrinsic resting-state activity, we found that ALFF in the middle frontal gyrus and  inferior/superior parietal lobules was positively correlated with WM task-evoked  activation, while ALFF in the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex,  superior frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and fusiform gyrus was negatively  correlated with WM task-evoked deactivation. Further, the relationship between the  intrinsic resting-state activity and task-evoked activation in lateral/superior  frontal gyri, inferior/superior parietal lobules, superior temporal gyrus, and  midline regions was stronger at higher WM task loads. In addition, both  resting-state activity and the task-evoked activation in the superior parietal  lobule/precuneus were significantly correlated with the WM task behavioral  performance, explaining similar portions of intersubject performance variance.  Together, these findings suggest that intrinsic resting-state activity facilitates  or is permissive of specific brain circuit engagement to perform a cognitive task,  and that resting activity can predict subsequent task-evoked brain responses and  behavioral performance.","2013-12","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","3204-3215","","12","34","","Hum Brain Mapp","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","","","","PMID: 22711376  PMCID: PMC6870161","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\3QV9AUNW\Zou et al. - 2013 - Intrinsic resting-state activity predicts working .pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Young Adult; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Oxygen/blood; Functional Laterality; Brain/blood supply/*physiology; Predictive Value of Tests; Rest/*physiology; N-back working memory; ALFF; behavior; Behavior/*physiology; load dependency; resting-state fMRI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A functional intronic  SNP (rs1076560) predicts relative expression of the two D2 receptors isoforms, D2S  (mainly pre-synaptic) and D2L (mainly post-synaptic). However, the effect of  functional genetic variation of DRD2 on striatal dopamine D2 signaling and on its  correlation with prefrontal activity during working memory in humans is not known.  METHODS: Thirty-seven healthy subjects were genotyped for rs1076560 (G>T) and  underwent SPECT with [123I]IBZM (which binds primarily to post-synaptic D2  receptors) and with [123I]FP-CIT (which binds to pre-synaptic dopamine transporters,  whose activity and density is also regulated by pre-synaptic D2 receptors), as well  as BOLD fMRI during N-Back working memory. RESULTS: Subjects carrying the T allele  (previously associated with reduced D2S expression) had striatal reductions of  [123I]IBZM and of [123I]FP-CIT binding. DRD2 genotype also differentially predicted  the correlation between striatal dopamine D2 signaling (as identified with factor  analysis of the two radiotracers) and activity of the prefrontal cortex during  working memory as measured with BOLD fMRI, which was positive in GG subjects and  negative in GT. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that this functional SNP within  DRD2 predicts striatal binding of the two radiotracers to dopamine transporters and  D2 receptors as well as the correlation between striatal D2 signaling with  prefrontal cortex activity during performance of a working memory task. These data  are consistent with the possibility that the balance of excitatory/inhibitory  modulation of striatal neurons may also affect striatal outputs in relationship with  prefrontal activity during working memory performance within the  cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical pathway.","2010-02-22","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","e9348","","2","5","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 20179754  PMCID: PMC2825256","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\4948A33E\Bertolino et al. - 2010 - Genetically determined measures of striatal D2 sig.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Genotype; Adult; Young Adult; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Psychomotor Performance/physiology; Analysis of Variance; Prefrontal Cortex/anatomy & histology/*physiology; Benzamides/metabolism; Binding, Competitive; Corpus Striatum/*metabolism; Dopamine Antagonists/metabolism; Introns/genetics; Pyrrolidines/metabolism; Radioligand Assay; Receptors, Dopamine D2/*genetics/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our aim,  therefore, was to identify abnormalities in the circuitry that mediates working  memory in nicotine-dependent subjects after they initiate abstinence from smoking.  METHODS: We used blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI) to study eight smokers while they performed a letter version of the  N-Back working memory task under satiety (< or = 1.5 hours abstinence) and  abstinence (> or = 14 hours abstinence) conditions. RESULTS: Task-related activity  in the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) showed a significant  interaction between test session (satiety, abstinence) and task load (1-back,  2-back, and 3-back). This interaction reflected the fact that task-related activity  in the satiety condition was relatively low during performance of the 1-back task  but greater at the more difficult task levels, whereas task-related activity in the  abstinence condition was relatively high at the 1-back level and did not increase at  the more difficult task levels.

The delayed matching-to-sample (dMTS) task is  another WM task, which in turn involves the encoding, maintenance, and retrieval of  stimulus representations in sequential order. Because both n-back and dMTS engage WM  function, we hypothesized that compared to a control task not taxing WM, training on  the n-back task would be associated with better performance on dMTS by virtue of  training a shared mental capacity. We tested this hypothesis by randomly assigning  subjects (N = 43) to train on either the n-back (including 2-back and 3-back levels)  or an active control task. Following training, dMTS was administered in the fMRI  scanner. The n-back group performed marginally better than the active control group  on dMTS. In addition, although the n-back group improved more on the less difficult  2-back level than the more difficult 3-back level across training sessions, it was  improvement on the 3-back level that accounted for 21% of the variance in dMTS  performance. For the control group, improvement in training across sessions was  unrelated to dMTS performance. At the neural level, greater activation in the left  inferior frontal gyrus, right posterior parietal cortex, and the cerebellum  distinguished the n-back group from the control group in the maintenance phase of  dMTS. Degree of improvement on the 3-back level across training sessions was  correlated with activation in right lateral prefrontal and motor cortices in the  maintenance phase of dMTS. Our results suggest that although n-back training is more  likely to improve performance in easier blocks, it is improvement in more difficult  blocks that is predictive of performance on a target task drawing on WM. In  addition, the extent to which training on a task can transfer to another task is  likely due to the engagement of shared cognitive capacities and underlying neural  substrates-in this case WM.","2015","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","86","","","9","","Front Syst Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 26082694  PMCID: PMC4451342","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\4HPUSI8J\Beatty et al. - 2015 - Transfer of training from one working memory task .pdf","","working memory; n-back; prefrontal cortex; cognitive training; delayed matching-to-sample","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: At hospital discharge and 3  months later, fMRI assessed subjects' functional activity during an N-back task.  Multiple linear regression was used to examine associations between duration of  delirium and brain activity, and elastic net regression was used to assess the  relationship between brain activation patterns at 3 months and cognitive outcomes at  12 months. RESULTS: Of 47 patients who underwent fMRI at discharge, 38 (80%)  completed the protocol; of 37 who underwent fMRI at 3 months, 34 (91%) completed the  protocol. At discharge, the mean (SD) percentage of correct responses on the most  challenging version (the N2 version) of the N-back task was 70.4 (23.2; range of  20-100) compared with 76 (23.4; range of 33-100) at 3 months. No association was  observed between delirium duration in the hospital and brain region activity in any  brain region at discharge or 3 months after adjusting for relevant covariates (P  values across all 11 brain regions of interest were >.25). CONCLUSIONS: Our data  support the feasibility of using fMRI in survivors of critical illness at 3-month  follow-up but not at discharge. In this small study, delirium was not associated  with distinct or abnormal brain activation patterns, although overall performance on  a cognitive task of working memory was poorer than observed in other cohorts of  individuals with medically related executive dysfunction, mild cognitive impairment,  and mild traumatic brain injury.","2015-06","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","653.e1-7","","3","30","","J Crit Care","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015.

OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that lowering the  typical dietary PA/OA would affect the activation of relevant brain networks during  a working memory task and would also lower secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines.  DESIGN: In 12 female subjects participating in a randomized, cross-over trial  comparing 3-week high PA diet (HPA) and low PA and a high OA diet (HOA), we  evaluated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using an N-back test of  working memory, cytokine secretion by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated peripheral  blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and plasma cytokine concentrations. RESULTS: Brain  activation during the HPA diet compared to the HOA diet was increased in regions of  the basal ganglia including the caudate and putamen (p<0.005). In addition, compared  to the HOA diet, during the HPA diet, the plasma concentrations of IL-6 (p=0.04) and  IL-1β (p=0.05) were higher, and there was a higher secretion of IL-18 (p=0.015) and  a trend for higher IL-1β secretion (p=0.066) from LPS-stimulated PBMCs. CONCLUSIONS:  The HPA diet resulted in increased brain activation in the basal ganglia compared to  the HOA diet as well as increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These  data provide evidence that short-term (2week) diet interventions impact brain  network activation during a working memory task and that these effects are  reversible since the order of the study diets was randomized. These data are  consistent with the hypothesis that lowering the dietary PA content via substitution  with OA also could affect cognition.","2016-10","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1582-1588","","10","65","","Metabolism","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated PFC function in schizophrenia  using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a parametric version of the  n-back working memory (WM) task. In a group of patients who performed relatively  well on this task, there were three fundamental deviations from the 'healthy'  pattern of PFC fMRI activation to varying WM difficulty. The first characteristic  was a greater magnitude of PFC fMRI activation in the context of slightly impaired  WM performance (i.e. physiological inefficiency). The second was that the  significant correlations between behavioral WM performance and dorsal PFC fMRI  activation were in opposite directions in the two groups. Third, the magnitude of  the abnormal dorsal PFC fMRI response was predicted by an assay of N-acetylaspartate  concentrations (NAA) in dorsal PFC, a measure of neuronal pathology obtained using  proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Patients had significantly lower dorsal PFC  NAA than controls and dorsal PFC NAA inversely predicted the fMRI response in dorsal  PFC (areas 9, 46) to varying WM difficulty - supporting the assumption that abnormal  PFC responses arose from abnormal PFC neurons.

We investigated the basis of this apparent  contradiction using a complex object working memory task, a Categorical n-back  (CN-BT). We examined whether the neural networks engaged by the CN-BT in children  consist of the same brain regions as those in adults, but with a different magnitude  of activation, or whether the networks are qualitatively different. Event-related  fMRI was used to study differences in brain activation between healthy children ages  6 and 10 years, and young adults (20-28 years). Performance accuracy and RTs in  10-year-olds and adults were comparable, but the performance in 6-year-olds was  lower. In adults, the CN-BT was highly effective in engaging the bilateral (L>R)  ventral prefrontal cortex, the bilateral fusiform gyrus, posterior cingulate and  precuneus, thus suggesting an involvement of the ventral visual stream, with related  feature extraction and semantic labeling strategies. In children, the brain networks  were distinctly different. They involved the premotor and parietal cortex, anterior  insula, caudate/putamen, and the cerebellum, thus suggesting a predominant  involvement of the visual dorsal and sensory-motor pathways, with related  visual-spatial and action cognitive strategies. The findings indicate engagement of  developmental networks in children reflecting task-effective brain activation. The  age-related pattern of fMRI activation suggests a working hypothesis of a  developmental shift from reliance on the dorsal visual stream and  premotor/striatal/cerebellar networks in young children to reliance on the ventral  prefrontal and inferior temporal networks in adults.","2006-11-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","980-990","","3","33","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16997580","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Child; Adult; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Photic Stimulation; Psychomotor Performance/*physiology; Memory, Short-Term/physiology; Attention/physiology; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Regression Analysis; Color Perception/physiology; Verbal Behavior/physiology; Aging/psychology; Nerve Net/*growth & development/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RESULTS: In the hyperthyroid  condition the subjects showed slower reaction times, but a higher accuracy in the  0-back version of the memory tasks. Fewer differences between euthyroid and  hyperthyroid state were seen for the more difficult conditions of the n-back task.  FMRI revealed effects of difficulty in the parahippocampal gyrus, supplementary  motor area, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cerebellum,  rolandic operculum and insula (p<0.05, FWE corrected). When comparing euthyroid and  hyperthyroid condition in relation to task-induced activation, differences of  activation were found in the right prefrontal cortex as well as in the right  parahippocampal area. In the psychological assessment, the alerting effect in the  Attention Network Task (ANT) and four out of five parameters of the auditory verbal  learning test (AVLT) showed an increase from euthyroid to hyperthyroid state.  CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that even a short-term intake of thyroid hormones  leads to an activation of brain areas associated with working memory and to an  improvement of accuracy of working memory tasks.","2016","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","e0161552","","8","11","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 27536945  PMCID: PMC4990413","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\XRKFDCKS\Göbel et al. - 2016 - Effect of Mild Thyrotoxicosis on Performance and B.pdf","","Humans; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Memory, Short-Term/drug effects/*physiology; Drug Administration Schedule; Functional Neuroimaging; Reaction Time/drug effects/physiology; Brain/diagnostic imaging/drug effects/*physiopathology; Thyrotoxicosis/*physiopathology; Thyroxine/administration & dosage/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Little research, however, has  investigated connectivity dynamics in relation to varying cognitive load. In fMRI,  correlations among slow (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations of blood oxygen level dependent  (BOLD) signal can be used to construct functional connectivity networks. Using an  anatomical parcellation scheme, we produced undirected weighted graphs linking 90  regions of the brain representing major cortical gyri and subcortical nuclei, in a  population of healthy adults (n=43). Topological changes in these networks were  investigated under different conditions of a classical working memory task - the  N-back paradigm. A mass-univariate approach was adopted to construct statistical  parametric networks (SPNs) that reflect significant modifications in functional  connectivity between N-back conditions. Our proposed method allowed the extraction  of 'lost' and 'gained' functional networks, providing concise graphical summaries of  whole-brain network topological changes. Robust estimates of functional networks are  obtained by pooling information about edges and vertices over subjects. Graph  thresholding is therefore here supplanted by inference. The analysis proceeds by  firstly considering changes in weighted cost (i.e. mean between-region correlation)  over the different N-back conditions and secondly comparing small-world topological  measures integrated over network cost, thereby controlling for differences in mean  correlation between conditions. The results are threefold: (i) functional networks  in the four conditions were all found to satisfy the small-world property and  cost-integrated global and local efficiency levels were approximately preserved  across the different experimental conditions; (ii) weighted cost considerably  decreased as working memory load increased; and (iii) subject-specific weighted  costs significantly predicted behavioral performances on the N-back task (Wald  F=13.39,df(1)=1,df(2)=83,p<0.001), and therefore conferred predictive validity to  functional connectivity strength, as measured by weighted cost. The results were  found to be highly sensitive to the frequency band used for the computation of the  between-region correlations, with the relationship between weighted cost and  behavioral performance being most salient at very low frequencies (0.01-0.03 Hz).  These findings are discussed in relation to the integration/specialization  functional dichotomy. The pruning of functional networks under increasing cognitive  load may permit greater modular specialization, thereby enhancing performance.","2011-03-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","688-704","","2","55","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Many neuropsychological studies  demonstrate impairment of working memory in patients with MDD. However, there are  few functional neuroimaging studies of MDD patients during working memory  processing, and most of the available ones included medicated patients or patients  with both MDD and bipolar disorder. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging  (fMRI) to measure prefrontal cortex function during working memory processing in  untreated depressed patients with MDD. Fifteen untreated individuals with Diagnostic  and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition recurrent MDD (mean  age+/-s.d.=34.3+/-11.5 years) and 15 healthy comparison subjects (37.7+/-12.1 years)  matched for age, sex and race were studied using a GE/Elscint 2T MR system. An  echo-planar MRI sequence was used to acquire 24 axial slices. The n-back task  (0-back, 1-back and 2-back) was used to elicit frontal cortex activation. Data were  analyzed with a multiple regression analysis using the FSL-FEAT software. MDD  patients showed significantly greater left dorsolateral cortex activation during the  n-back task compared to the healthy controls (P<0.01), although task performance was  similar in the two groups. Furthermore, the patients showed significant anterior  cingulate cortex activation during the task, but the comparison subjects did not  (P<0.01). This study provides in vivo imaging evidence of abnormal frontolimbic  circuit function during working memory processing in individuals with MDD.","2007-02","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","158-166","","2","12","","Mol Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 16983390","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\S6HE52YZ\Matsuo et al. - 2007 - Prefrontal hyperactivation during working memory t.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Prefrontal Cortex/*physiopathology; Gyrus Cinguli/physiopathology; Depressive Disorder, Major/*physiopathology; Attention/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Cirrhotics with MHE underwent baseline endotoxin and  cognitive testing, then underwent fMRI, diffusion tensor imaging and MR  spectroscopy(MRS). On fMRI, two tasks; N-back (outcome: correct responses) and  inhibitory control tests(outcomes: lure inhibition) were performed. All procedures  were repeated after 8 weeks of rifaximin. RESULTS were compared before/after  rifaximin. RESULTS: 20 MHE patients (59.7 years) were included; sixteen completed  pre/post-rifaximin scanning with 92% medication compliance. Pre-rifaximin patients  had cognitive impairment. At trial-end, there was a significantly higher correct  2-back responses, ICT lure inhibitions and reduced endotoxemia(p = 0.002). This was  accompanied by significantly higher activation from baseline in subcortical  structures (thalamus, caudate, insula and hippocampus) and left parietal operculum  (LPO) during N-back, decrease in fronto-parietal activation required for inhibiting  lures, including LPO during ICT compared to baseline values. Connectivity studies in  N-back showed significant shifts in linkages after therapy in fronto-parietal  regions with a reduction in fractional anisotropy (FA) but not mean diffusivity  (MD), and no change in MRS metabolites at the end of the trial. A significant  improvement in cognition including working memory and inhibitory control, and  fractional anisotropy without effect on MD or MRS, through modulation of  fronto-parietal and subcortical activation and connectivity was seen after  open-label rifaximin therapy in MHE.","2014-12","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1017-1025","","4","29","","Metab Brain Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 24590688  PMCID: PMC4155029","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\9YCGJEA9\Ahluwalia et al. - 2014 - Enhancement of functional connectivity, working me.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; *Functional Neuroimaging; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; *Connectome; Brain/*pathology/physiopathology; Memory, Short-Term/*drug effects; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Inhibition, Psychological; *Multimodal Imaging; Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Bacterial Translocation; Brain Chemistry/drug effects; Cognition Disorders/etiology/microbiology/*prevention & control; Hepatic Encephalopathy/*drug therapy/etiology/microbiology/pathology/physiopathology; Intestines/*microbiology; Liver Cirrhosis/complications/*drug therapy/microbiology/pathology/physiopathology; Liver/physiopathology; Microbiota/drug effects; Rifamycins/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Rifaximin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The modified Story Memory Technique (mSMT) has been shown to improve new learning and  memory in MS, but its effects on working memory (WM) are currently unknown.  OBJECTIVE: The present study presents a secondary analysis of data from a larger  double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial and examines changes in  cerebral activation on a WM task following mSMT treatment. METHODS: Sixteen  participants with clinically definite MS were randomly assigned to treatment (n=7)  or placebo-control groups (n=9) matched for gender, age and education. Baseline and  immediate follow-up functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was obtained for  all subjects. During fMRI participants completed an N-back task, consisting of 0-,  1-and 2-back conditions. RESULTS: Significant increases in cerebral activation were  noted in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area and inferior  parietal lobule at follow-up in the treatment group. No significant changes were  noted in the placebo control group. CONCLUSION: Due to the small sample size,  results of the current study should be interpreted as preliminary. However, the  observed pattern of activation of the frontoparietal network involved in WM found in  the treatment group, suggests that mSMT training increases recruitment of attention-  and WM-related neural networks. We conclude that mSMT treatment leads to changes in  WM-related cerebral activation.","2016-05","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","76-82","","","7","","Mult Scler Relat Disord","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Serotonin agonists modulate WM and there is evidence of  positive behavioural effects in both disorders. We therefore used functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate shared and disorder-specific brain  dysfunctions of WM in these disorders, and the effects of a single dose of the  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine. METHOD: Age-matched boys  with ADHD (n = 17), ASD (n = 17) and controls (n = 22) were compared using fMRI  during an N-back WM task. Patients were scanned twice, under either an acute dose of  fluoxetine or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized design.  Repeated-measures analyses within patients assessed drug effects on performance and  brain function. To test for normalization effects of brain dysfunctions, patients  under each drug condition were compared to controls. RESULTS: Under placebo,  relative to controls, both ADHD and ASD boys shared underactivation in the right  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Fluoxetine significantly normalized the  DLPFC underactivation in ASD relative to controls whereas it increased posterior  cingulate cortex (PCC) deactivation in ADHD relative to control boys. Within-patient  analyses showed inverse effects of fluoxetine on PCC deactivation, which it enhanced  in ADHD and decreased in ASD. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show that fluoxetine  modulates brain activation during WM in a disorder-specific manner by normalizing  task-positive DLPFC dysfunction in ASD boys and enhancing task-negative default mode  network (DMN) deactivation in ADHD.","2015-04","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1195-1205","","6","45","","Psychol Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 25292351","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\MCG8QRG7\Chantiluke et al. - 2015 - Disorder-dissociated effects of fluoxetine on brai.pdf","","Humans; Male; Child; Adolescent; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; working memory; Memory, Short-Term/*drug effects/physiology; Double-Blind Method; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Autism Spectrum Disorder/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Fluoxetine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Gyrus Cinguli/*drug effects/physiopathology; Prefrontal Cortex/*drug effects/physiopathology; Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within this model,  frontoparietal network recruitment is believed to contribute to both the spatial  processing and working memory task demands. The current study used functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test each step of this model in 15 participants  who encoded OLAs and performed standard n-back tasks. As expected, object processing  resulted in activation of the ventral visual stream. Object in location processing  resulted in activation of both the ventral and dorsal visual streams as well as a  lateral frontoparietal network. This condition was also the only one to result in  medial temporal lobe activation, supporting its role in associative learning. A  conjunction analysis revealed areas of shared activation between the working memory  and object in location phase within the lateral frontoparietal network, anterior  insula, and basal ganglia; consistent with prior working memory literature.

Studies in humanized mice document an interaction between estrus cycle-related  changes in estradiol secretion and BDNF Val(66)Met genotype on measures of  hippocampal function and anxiety-like behavior. We believe our multimodal imaging  data provide the first demonstration in women that the effects of the BDNF Val/Met  polymorphism on hippocampal function are selectively modulated by estradiol. In a  6-month pharmacological hormone manipulation protocol, healthy, regularly  menstruating, asymptomatic women completed positron emission tomography (PET) and  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans while performing the n-back  working memory task during three hormone conditions: ovarian suppression induced by  the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, leuprolide acetate; leuprolide plus  estradiol; and leuprolide plus progesterone. For each of the three hormone  conditions, a discovery data set was obtained with oxygen-15 water regional cerebral  blood flow PET in 39 healthy women genotyped for BDNF Val(66)Met, and a confirmatory  data set was obtained with fMRI in 27 women. Our results, in close agreement across  the two imaging platforms, demonstrate an ovarian hormone-by-BDNF interaction on  working memory-related hippocampal function (PET: F(2,37)=9.11, P=0.00026  uncorrected, P=0.05, familywise error corrected with small volume correction; fMRI:  F(2,25)=5.43, P=0.01, uncorrected) that reflects differential hippocampal  recruitment in Met carriers but only in the presence of estradiol. These findings  have clinical relevance for understanding the neurobiological basis of individual  differences in the cognitive and behavioral effects of ovarian steroids in women,  and may provide a neurogenetic framework for understanding neuropsychiatric  disorders related to reproductive hormones as well as illnesses with sex differences  in disease expression and course.","2018-04","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1066-1075","","4","23","","Mol Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 28416813","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\FQBV76I5\Wei et al. - 2018 - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val(66)Met genot.pdf","","Humans; Female; Adult; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Random Allocation; Double-Blind Method; Positron-Emission Tomography; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*genetics/*metabolism; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Estradiol/administration & dosage/blood; Gonadal Steroid Hormones/*metabolism; Hippocampus/diagnostic imaging/*metabolism; Leuprolide/pharmacology; Methionine/genetics; Multimodal Imaging/methods; Neuroimaging/methods; Ovary/metabolism; Progesterone/administration & dosage/blood; Suppositories; Valine/genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A number of studies support the  assumptions of GWT by showing the reorganization of the whole-brain functional  network during cognitive task performance; however, the involvement of specific  large scale networks in the formation of workspace is still not well-understood. The  aims of our study were: (1) to examine changes in the whole-brain functional network  under increased cognitive demands of working memory during an n-back task, and their  relationship with behavioral outcomes; and (2) to provide a comprehensive  description of local changes that may be involved in the formation of the global  workspace, using hub detection and network-based statistic. Our results show that  network modularity decreased with increasing cognitive demands, and this change  allowed us to predict behavioral performance. The number of connector hubs  increased, whereas the number of provincial hubs decreased when the task became more  demanding. We also found that the default mode network (DMN) increased its  connectivity to other networks while decreasing connectivity between its own  regions. These results, apart from replicating previous findings, provide a valuable  insight into the mechanisms of the formation of the global workspace, highlighting  the role of the DMN in the processes of network integration.

Aim of the experiment was to distinguish nonspecific task-related processes  from specific workload processes analytically. Twelve healthy volunteers engaged in  a spatial n-back task with four levels. FMRI data were acquired with the 3D-PRESTO  pulse sequence. Analysis entailed a two-step multiple regression algorithm, which  was specifically designed to measure and separate load-sensitive and  load-insensitive activity simultaneously, while preserving the original high spatial  resolution of the fMRI signal. Load-sensitive and load-insensitive activity was  found in both dorsolateral-prefrontal and parietal cortex, predominantly  bilaterally, and in the anterior cingulate. As expected, the left primary  sensorimotor cortex showed predominantly load-insensitive activity. Load-sensitive  activity reflects specific working memory functions, such as temporary retention and  manipulation of information, while load-insensitive activity reflects supportive  functions, such as visual orientation, perception, encoding, and response selection  and execution. Good performance was correlated with a large area of load-sensitive  activity in anterior cingulate, and with a small area of load-insensitive activity  in the right parietal cortex. The findings indicate that nonspecific and specific  working memory processes colocalize and are represented in multiple frontal and  parietal regions.

Evidence exists that aging is accompanied by a reorganization of the working-memory circuitry, but the underlying  neurocognitive mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we examined aging-related  changes in prefrontal activation during working-memory performance using functional  Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), a noninvasive neuroimaging technique. Seventeen  healthy young (21-32 years) and 17 healthy older adults (64-81 years) performed a  verbal working-memory task (n-back). Oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin  concentration changes were registered by two fNIRS channels located over the left  and right prefrontal cortex. Increased working-memory load resulted in worse  performance compared to the control condition in older adults, but not in young  participants. In both young and older adults, prefrontal activation increased with  rising working-memory load. Young adults showed slight right-hemispheric dominance  at low levels of working-memory load, while no hemispheric differences were apparent  in older adults. Analysis of the time-activation curve during the high  working-memory load condition revealed a continuous increase of the hemodynamic  response in the young. In contrast to that, a quadratic pattern of activation was  found in the older participants. Based on these results it could be hypothesized  that young adults were better able to keep the prefrontal cortex recruited over a  prolonged period of time. To conclude, already at low levels of working-memory load  do older adults recruit both hemispheres, possibly in an attempt to compensate for  the observed aging-related decline in performance. Also, our study shows that aging  effects on the time course of the hemodynamic response must be taken into account in  the interpretation of the results of neuroimaging studies that rely on blood oxygen  levels, such as fMRI.","2012","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","e46210","","9","7","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 23029437  PMCID: PMC3460859","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\4NCU75NF\Vermeij et al. - 2012 - Effects of aging on cerebral oxygenation during wo.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Middle Aged; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Reaction Time; Aging/*physiology; Prefrontal Cortex/blood supply/*physiology; Hemodynamics/*physiology; Oxygen/*physiology; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the role of prefrontal H(3) receptors in working memory  has not yet been clarified. Therefore, using functional magnetic resonance imaging  (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) techniques, we aimed to investigate  the association between the neural activity of working memory and the density of  H(3) receptors in the prefrontal cortex.

H(3) receptor density was measured with the selective PET  radioligand [(11)C] TASP457. The neural activity of the right dorsolateral  prefrontal cortex during the performance of the N-back task was negatively  correlated with the density of H(3) receptors in this region. CONCLUSIONS: Higher  neural activity of working memory was associated with lower H(3) receptor density in  the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

Heritable prefrontal fMRI  activation during working memory (WM) is such a phenotype. We hypothesized that  urban upbringing (childhood urbanicity) would alter this phenotype and interact with  dopamine genes that regulate prefrontal function during WM. Further, dopamine has  been hypothesized to mediate urban-associated factors like social stress. WM-related  prefrontal function was tested for main effects of urbanicity, main effects of three  dopamine genes-catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1), and  dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2)-and, importantly, dopamine gene-by-urbanicity  interactions. For COMT, three independent human samples were recruited (total n =  487). We also studied 253 subjects genotyped for DRD1 and DRD2. 3T fMRI activation  during the N-back WM task was the dependent variable, while childhood urbanicity,  dopamine genotype, and urbanicity-dopamine interactions were independent variables.  Main effects of dopamine genes and of urbanicity were found. Individuals raised in  an urban environment showed altered prefrontal activation relative to those raised  in rural or town settings. For each gene, dopamine genotype-by-urbanicity  interactions were shown in prefrontal cortex-COMT replicated twice in two  independent samples. An urban childhood upbringing altered prefrontal function and  interacted with each gene to alter genotype-phenotype relationships.  Gene-environment interactions between multiple dopamine genes and urban upbringing  suggest that neural effects of developmental environmental exposure could mediate,  at least partially, increased risk for psychiatric illness in urban environments via  dopamine genes expressed into adulthood.","2018","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","e0195189","","4","13","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 29634738  PMCID: PMC5892884","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\D5H58WGM\Reed et al. - 2018 - Interaction of childhood urbanicity and variation .pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Phenotype; Social Behavior; Genotype; Child; Adult; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain/*diagnostic imaging; Memory, Short-Term; Intelligence Tests; Prefrontal Cortex/*diagnostic imaging; Catechol O-Methyltransferase/*genetics; Dopamine/physiology; Social Class; United States; *Urban Population; Gene-Environment Interaction; Italy; Receptors, Dopamine D1/*genetics; Receptors, Dopamine D2/*genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we tested the influence of (a) averbal semantics and (b)  different tasks on performance in a vWM context by examining stimulus and  task-specific variation of activity in the horizontal parts of the intraparietal  sulcus (hIPS). The hIPS has previously been shown to subserve magnitude processing  modulated by (a) specific stimuli and (b) specific tasks. Two variants of an n-back  paradigm (comparison and identity match tasks) utilizing letters and numbers as  stimulus material at different levels of vWM load were administered in 16  participants. Behavioral and functional imaging data reveal stimulus-specific  modulation of activity in the hIPS suggesting a semantic influence of numbers. In  the identity match task, numbers induced additional hIPS activation compared to  letters while letters never induced additional hIPS activation when compared to  numbers. Letters as compared to numbers only induced additional hIPS activation in  the comparison task. These results question the assumption of a purely phonological  code in vWM because hIPS activation subserving magnitude processing is modulated by  stimulus semantics and task demands.","2006-01-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1-14","","1","29","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16095920","","","","Humans; Male; Adult; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Photic Stimulation; Parietal Lobe/physiology; Brain/*physiology; Psychomotor Performance/physiology; Prefrontal Cortex/physiology; Reaction Time/physiology; Reading","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is, however,  not clear whether abnormal activation is a sign of DLPFC pathology, or a correlate  of poor performance. We address this question by examining activity in the WM brain  system at different levels of task difficulty. A parametric fMRI paradigm is used to  examine how the WM system responds to increasing load. A parametric fMRI design with  four levels of a spatial N-back task was used to examine the relationships between  working memory load, functional output (performance) and brain activity in 10  schizophrenic patients on atypical antipsychotic medication and to compare these to  10 healthy controls. In spite of increasingly poor performance in schizophrenic  patients, activity increased normally in DLPFC and inferior parietal cortex  bilaterally and in anterior cingulate, with increasing load. At 3-back, activity  dropped in DLPFC in comparison with controls, but not in the other regions. The  results indicate that peak activation of the WM-system is reached at a lower  processing load in schizophrenic patients than in healthy controls. As a decline of  DLPFC activity at high processing loads in itself is not abnormal, WM dysfunction in  schizophrenia appears to be the result of an impaired functional output of the whole  WM system, causing elevation of the effective burden imposed by WM tasks.","2004-06-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","159-171","","2-3","68","","Schizophr Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 15099600","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Brain Mapping; Neuropsychological Tests; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Schizophrenic Psychology; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Functional Laterality/physiology; Prefrontal Cortex/drug effects/*physiology; Psychomotor Performance/drug effects/*physiology; Antipsychotic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Memory Disorders/diagnosis; Memory/drug effects/*physiology; Parietal Lobe/drug effects/*physiology; Retention, Psychology/drug effects; Schizophrenia/*diagnosis/drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A large  subgroup seems to experience OCS as a consequence of second-generation antipsychotic  agents (SGA), such as clozapine. So far little is known about underlying neural  mechanisms. METHODS: To investigate the role of SGA treatment on neural processing  related to OCS in patients with schizophrenia, we stratified patients according to  their monotherapy into 2 groups (group I: clozapine or olanzapine; group II:  amisulpride or aripiprazole). We used an fMRI approach, applying a go/no-go task  assessing inhibitory control and an n-back task measuring working memory. RESULTS:  We enrolled 21 patients in group I and 19 patients in group II. Groups did not  differ regarding age, sex, education or severity of psychotic symptoms. Frequency  and severity of OCS were significantly higher in group I and were associated with  pronounced deficits in specific cognitive abilities. Whereas brain activation  patterns did not differ during working memory, group I showed significantly  increased activation in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) during response inhibition.  Alterations in OFC activation were associated with the severity of obsessions and  mediated the association between SGA treatment and co-occurring OCS on a trend  level. LIMITATIONS: The main limitation of this study is its cross-sectional design.  CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first imaging study conducted to elucidate  SGA effects on neural systems related to OCS. We propose that alterations in brain  functioning reflect a pathogenic mechanism in the development of SGA-induced OCS in  patients with schizophrenia. Longitudinal studies and randomized interventions are  needed to prove the suggested causal interrelations.","2015-03","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","89-99","","2","40","","J Psychiatry Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 25268790  PMCID: PMC4354822","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\LAXXSMD3\Schirmbeck et al. - 2015 - Increased orbitofrontal cortex activation associat.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Inhibition, Psychological; Amisulpride; Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use; Aripiprazole; Benzodiazepines/therapeutic use; Clozapine/therapeutic use; Executive Function/drug effects/physiology; Obsessive Behavior/drug therapy/physiopathology; Olanzapine; Piperazines/therapeutic use; Prefrontal Cortex/*drug effects/*physiopathology; Psychomotor Performance/drug effects/physiology; Quinolones/therapeutic use; Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/*physiopathology; Sulpiride/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

HCs are usually administered in a monthly cycle with both  synthetic-hormone-containing and synthetic-hormone-absent phases. The synthetic  hormones contained in HCs affect a wide range of neurophysiological systems,  suggesting that effects of the medication might only be observed during the  synthetic-hormone-containing phase of the HC cycle. To test this, women were seen  twice, once during the hormone-present phase and once during the hormone-absent  phase of the HC cycle. In each session, women performed an n-back working memory  task to assess pre-stress performance outside of the magnetic resonance imaging  scanner, were then exposed to cold pressor stress, and again completed the n-back  task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The free cortisol response to  stress remained the same across the HC cycle. Women also performed comparably on the  n-back task after stress exposure across the two phases. However, despite these  similarities, women displayed greater disengagement of default mode network as task  demands increased during the hormone-present phase only, a pattern more in line with  working memory-related brain activation under non-stressful conditions reported in  other studies. The results suggest that the synthetic hormones contained in HCs may  mitigate stress-related disruptions of typical brain activation patterns during the  hormone-present phase of the HC cycle, despite exhibiting comparable cortisol  responses across the HC cycle.

METHODS: Twelve healthy right-handed female subjects completed the study. Each  patient performed a jaw-tapping task and an n-back task during functional magnetic  resonance imaging (fMRI). The subjects were trained to carry out the jaw-tapping  movement at home twice a day for 4 weeks. The fMRI was repeated when they returned.  RESULTS: During the first and second jaw-tapping session, both sides of precentral  gyrus and the right middle frontal gyrus (BA 6) were activated. And during the  second session of the jaw-tapping task, parts of frontal lobe and temporal lobe  related to memory function were more activated. In addition, the total percent task  accuracy in n-back task significantly increased after 4 weeks of jawtapping  movement. After jaw-tapping training for 4 weeks, brain areas related to memory  showed significantly increased blood oxygen level dependent signals.

We found that activations in the anterior  superior temporal gyrus (STG) were stronger during spatial discrimination than  during spatial memory, while spatial memory was associated with stronger activations  in the inferior parietal lobule (IPL). We also found that wide AC areas were  strongly deactivated during the spatial memory tasks. The present AC activation  patterns associated with spatial discrimination and spatial memory tasks were highly  similar to those obtained in our previous study comparing AC activations during  pitch discrimination and pitch memory (Rinne et al., 2009). Together our previous  and present results indicate that discrimination and memory tasks activate anterior  and posterior AC areas differently and that this anterior-posterior division is  present both when these tasks are performed on spatially invariant (pitch  discrimination vs. memory) or spatially varying (spatial discrimination vs. memory)  sounds. These results also further strengthen the view that activations of human AC  cannot be explained only by stimulus-level parameters (e.g., spatial vs. nonspatial  stimuli) but that the activations observed with fMRI are strongly dependent on the  characteristics of the behavioral task. Thus, our results suggest that in order to  understand the functional structure of AC a more systematic investigation of  task-related factors affecting AC activations is needed.","2012-02-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","4126-4131","","4","59","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Brain imaging studies on visuospatial WM in alcohol-dependent  patients compared to controls indicate that information processing requires  compensatory increased neural activation to perform at a normal level. However, to  date, no study tested whether such increased neural WM activation patterns or the  lack thereof predict relapse behavior in alcohol-dependent individuals, and whether  such differences persist when adequately correcting for individual grey matter  differences. We combined analyses of neural activation during an n-back task and  local grey matter volumes using Biological Parametric Mapping in 40 detoxified  alcohol-dependent patients and 40 matched healthy controls (HC), and assessed  prospective relapse risk during a 7-month follow-up period. Despite equal task  performance, we found increased functional activation during high versus low  cognitive WM load (2-back-0-back) in bilateral rostral prefrontal cortex (BA10) and  bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (BA45,47) in prospective abstainers versus  relapsers, and further in left/right lateral/medial premotor cortex (BA6,8) in  abstainers versus HC. In prospective abstainers, but not relapsers, subtle cognitive  impairment was associated with increased neural task activity in the premotor  cortex. These findings suggest that in prospective abstainers, higher functional  engagement of presumably less impaired neural resources in executive behavioral  control brain areas (BA10, 45, 47, 6, 8) may constitute a resilience factor  associated with good treatment outcome.","2014-05","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","402-414","","3","19","","Addict Biol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2013 Society for the Study of Addiction.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 24147643","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\WWSYDE4D\Charlet et al. - 2014 - Increased neural activity during high working memo.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Risk Factors; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; fMRI; working memory; n-back; Psychomotor Performance/physiology; Recurrence; Case-Control Studies; Prefrontal Cortex/physiology; Analysis of Variance; Alcohol; Alcohol Abstinence; Alcoholism/*physiopathology/psychology; follow-up; Gray Matter/*physiology; Memory Disorders/*physiopathology; Motor Cortex/physiology; relapse prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To examine a particular clinical concern regarding the possible  impact of ADT on cognition, the current study combined neuropsychological testing  with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess both brain activation  during cognitive performance as well as the integrity of brain connectivity.  METHODS: In a prospective observational cohort analysis of men with non-metastatic  prostate cancer at a Veterans Affairs medical center, patients receiving ADT were  compared with patients not receiving ADT at baseline and at 6 months. Assessments  included fMRI, the N-back task (for working memory), the stop-signal task (for  cognitive control), and a quality of life questionnaire. RESULTS: Among 36 patients  enrolled (18 in each group), 30 completed study evaluations (15 in each group); 5  withdrew participation and 1 died. Results for the N-back task, stop-signal task,  and quality of life were similar at 6 months vs. baseline in each group. In  contrast, statistically significant associations were found between ADT use (vs. non  use) and decreased medial prefrontal cortical activation during cognitive control,  as well as decreased connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex and other  regions involved with cognitive control. CONCLUSIONS: Although ADT for 6 months did  not affect selected tests of cognitive function, brain activations during cognitive  control and functional brain connectivity were impaired on fMRI. The long-term  clinical implications of these changes are not known and warrant future study.","2012-08-27","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","371","","","12","","BMC Cancer","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 22925152  PMCID: PMC3502584","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\BGAMSNQ7\Chao et al. - 2012 - Effects of androgen deprivation on brain function .pdf","","Humans; Male; Aged; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Cohort Studies; Treatment Outcome; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Prospective Studies; Cognition/*drug effects; Memory/drug effects; Androgen Antagonists/*adverse effects/therapeutic use; Anilides/adverse effects/therapeutic use; Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*adverse effects/therapeutic use; Brain/*drug effects/metabolism/physiopathology; Goserelin/adverse effects/therapeutic use; Nitriles/adverse effects/therapeutic use; Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Psychomotor Performance/drug effects; Quality of Life; Tosyl Compounds/adverse effects/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The specific contribution of the muscarinic  receptor system on cognitive performance and brain activation, however, has not been  evaluated satisfyingly. To investigate the specific contribution of the muscarinic  transmission on neural correlates of working memory, we examined the effects of  scopolamine, an antagonist of the muscarinic receptors, using functional magnetic  resonance imaging (fMRI). Fifteen healthy male, non-smoking subjects performed a  fMRI scanning session following the application of scopolamine (0.4 mg, i.v.) or  saline in a placebo-controlled, repeated measure, pseudo-randomized, single-blind  design. Working memory was probed using an n-back task. Compared to placebo,  challenging the cholinergic transmission with scopolamine resulted in  hypoactivations in parietal, occipital and cerebellar areas and hyperactivations in  frontal and prefrontal areas. These alterations are interpreted as compensatory  strategies used to account for downregulation due to muscarinic acetylcholine  blockade in parietal and cerebral storage systems by increased activation in frontal  and prefrontal areas related to working memory rehearsal. Our results further  underline the importance of cholinergic transmission to working memory performance  and determine the specific contribution of muscarinic transmission on cerebral  activation associated with executive functioning.","2012-06","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","329-339","","4","262","","Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 22006639","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\XD4EKNDA\Voss et al. - 2012 - Cholinergic blockade under working memory demands .pdf","","Humans; Male; Adult; Neuropsychological Tests; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods; Single-Blind Method; Reaction Time/drug effects/physiology; Executive Function/drug effects/physiology; *Memory, Short-Term/drug effects/physiology; Down-Regulation/physiology; Muscarinic Antagonists/pharmacology; Prefrontal Cortex/drug effects/physiology; Receptors, Muscarinic/*physiology; Scopolamine/*pharmacology; Synaptic Transmission/drug effects/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examines neurofunctional differences  during working memory between breast cancer (BC) patients and controls, prior to  chemotherapy. METHODS: Early stage BC females (23), scanned after surgery but before  chemotherapy, were individually matched to non-cancer controls. Participants  underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a  Visuospatial N-back task and data was analyzed by multiple group comparisons. fMRI  task performance, neuropsychological tests, hospital records, and salivary  biomarkers were also collected. RESULTS: There were no significant group differences  on neuropsychological tests, estrogen, or cortisol. Patients made significantly  fewer commission errors but had less overall correct responses and were slower than  controls during the task. Significant group differences were observed for the fMRI  data, yet results depended on the type of analysis. BC patients presented with  increased activations during working memory compared to controls in areas such as  the inferior frontal gyrus, insula, thalamus, and midbrain. Individual group  regressions revealed a reverse relationship between brain activity and commission  errors. CONCLUSION: This is the first fMRI investigation to reveal  neurophysiological differences during visuospatial working memory between BC  patients pre-chemotherapy and controls. These results also increase the knowledge  about the effects of BC and related factors on the working memory network.  SIGNIFICANCE: This highlights the need to better understand the pre-chemotherapy BC  patient and the effects of associated confounding variables.","2011","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","122","","","5","","Front Hum Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 22053153  PMCID: PMC3205481","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\S9W76MRC\Scherling et al. - 2011 - Pre-chemotherapy differences in visuospatial worki.pdf","","cognitive impairment; functional magnetic resonance imaging; stress; breast cancer; chemotherapy; pre-treatment effects; surgery; visuospatial working memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During the first examination, though both  groups engaged bilateral fronto-parietal regions known to be involved in working  memory, activation of the right superior frontal gyrus was low in the TBI group.  However, the difference between TBI and controls had decreased significantly after 6  months. A factor analysis confirmed the greater increase in activation in the right  superior frontal cortex in the TBI group than in healthy controls, leading to  normalization of the brain activation pattern.

Recently, sapropterin dihydrochloride, a synthetic form  of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), has been introduced as a supplemental treatment to  dietary phe control for PKU. Very little is known regarding BH4 treatment and its  effect on brain and cognition. The present study represents the first examination of  potential changes in neural activation in patients with PKU during BH4 treatment. To  this end, we utilized an n-back working memory task in conjunction with functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate functional brain integrity in a sample  of individuals with PKU at three timepoints: Just prior to BH4 treatment, after  4 weeks of treatment, and after 6 months of treatment. Neural activation patterns  observed for the PKU treatment group were compared with those of a  demographically-matched sample of healthy non-PKU individuals who were assessed at  identical time intervals. Consistent with past research, baseline evaluation  revealed impaired working memory and atypical brain activation in the PKU group as  compared to the non-PKU group. Most importantly, BH4 treatment was associated with  improvements in both working memory and brain activation, with neural changes  evident earlier (4-week timepoint) than changes in working memory performance  (6-month timepoint).","2013","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","539-547","","","3","","Neuroimage Clin","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 24371792  PMCID: PMC3871382","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\L7I23CU6\Christ et al. - 2013 - The effects of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) treatment.pdf","","fMRI; Working memory; Executive function; Phenylketonuria; Prefrontal cortex; Sapropterin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The hippocampus contains a high concentration of both mineralocorticoid  (MR) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR), and the experimental administration of  corticosteroids has been reported to mimic memory impairments seen in depression.  Using pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) we investigated  whether hippocampal function is altered after acute administration of  hydrocortisone. Changes in BOLD signal following infusion of 100mg hydrocortisone  given as a rapid intravenous bolus were measured in 14 healthy volunteers in a  within-subject placebo-controlled crossover design. Subsequently, subjects completed  an n-back task during an fMRI scan. Hydrocortisone infusion caused a significant,  time-dependent increase in fMRI BOLD signal in hippocampus reaching a maximal effect  at 11-19min. The n-back task increased BOLD signal in prefrontal and parietal  cortical areas and decreased it in the hippocampus. After hydrocortisone the left  hippocampal decrease in BOLD signal was attenuated with the magnitude of attenuation  correlating with the increase seen after hydrocortisone infusion. No difference in  behavioural task performance was observed. The results suggest acute hydrocortisone  has rapid direct and modulatory influences on hippocampal function, probably acting  through non-genomic GR or MR signalling. Hydrocortisone infusion phMRI may be a  useful tool to investigate hippocampal corticosteroid receptor function in  depression.","2012-12","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","867-874","","12","22","","Eur Neuropsychopharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","Crown Copyright © 2012.

We used blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI)  to investigate working memory function in NPSLE patients. METHODS: Twenty-seven  females took part: nine NPSLE patients (mean age 40 yrs; SLEDAI 10.9); nine RA  patients and nine healthy controls. Subjects were tested using the n-back paradigm  for working memory, where patients indicate when a stimulus matches one presented n  trials previously. Functional scans used 3 mm slices x 30, repetition time 2570 ms,  echo time 50 ms. Echo planar images were superimposed onto T1w anatomical images  (Siemens 1.5 T).

Only few take advantage of the intrinsic characteristics  of SPECT, particularly those allowing cognitive assessment outside of the camera, in  settings close to the standard clinical or laboratory ones. The purpose of the study  was to assess the feasibility of a split-dose activation protocol with (99m)Tc-HMPAO  using low irradiation dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A two-scans protocol was applied  to 12 healthy young volunteers using 270 MBq of (99m)Tc-HMPAO per scan, with each  image associated to a particular experimental condition of the verbal n-back working  memory task (0-back, 2-back). Subtraction method was used to identify regional brain  activity related to the task. RESULTS: Voxel-wise statistical analysis showed left  lateralized activity associated with the 2-back task, compared to the 0-back task.  Activated regions, mainly prefrontal and parietal, were similar to those observed in  previous fMRI and (15)O-PET studies. CONCLUSION: The results support the use of  (99m)Tc-HMPAO SPECT for the investigation of brain-cognition relations and  demonstrate the feasibility of optimal quality images despite low  radiopharmaceutical doses. The findings also acknowledge the use of HMPAO as a  radioligand to capture neuro-energetic modulations linked to cognitive activity.

Results show that the transient component of these functions is  supported by a buffer-specific network of posterior regions including the right  middle temporal lobe, possibly relating to binding of phonological loop  representations with semantic representations in long-term memory, as well as a  loop-specific network, in line with predictions of a functional relationship between  loop and buffer. The left hippocampus was engaged in transient and sustained  components of buffer processing, possibly reflecting the meaningful nature of the  stimuli. Only a minor role was found for executive functions in line with other  recent work. A novel representation of the sustained component of working memory for  audiovisual language in the right inferior temporal lobe may be related to  perception of speech-related facial gestures.

In the present study, we aimed to assess how recent smoking  (overnight abstinence vs. smoking ad libitum) influenced the effect of smoking a  cigarette on brain activity related to a working memory challenge. Six smokers  performed the N-Back working memory task during functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI) both before and after smoking a cigarette in each of two test  sessions: one following overnight abstinence from smoking ( approximately 13 h) and  the other following ad libitum smoking. Task-related activity in L-DLPFC showed a  significant interaction between the effects of acute smoking, test session, and task  load. After overnight abstinence, post-smoking brain activity in L-DLPFC was lower  than before smoking at low task load and higher at high task load; corresponding  activity on a day of ad libitum smoking was higher at low load and lower at high  task load after smoking during the session. These data suggest that the effect of  acute smoking on working memory processing depends on recent prior smoking and task  load. In particular, they provide preliminary evidence that functional efficiency of  working memory is improved by smoking a cigarette during abstinence, while the  effect of a cigarette in a non-deprived state varies with the nature and difficulty  of the working memory challenge. This interaction merits further examination in  larger studies specifically designed to consider this issue.","2006-12-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","103-109","","2-3","148","","Psychiatry Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 17088048  PMCID: PMC1817900","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\NTXMK7E3\Xu et al. - 2006 - Effects of acute smoking on brain activity vary wi.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Attention/drug effects/physiology; Brain/*drug effects/physiopathology; Dominance, Cerebral/physiology; Prefrontal Cortex/*drug effects/physiopathology; Psychomotor Performance/drug effects/physiology; *Smoking Cessation/psychology; Arousal/drug effects/physiology; Nicotine/*adverse effects; Pattern Recognition, Visual/*drug effects/physiology; Smoking/adverse effects/*physiopathology; Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/*physiopathology; Tobacco Use Disorder/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, several studies have shown that WM training may lead to performance increases not only in the trained  task, but also in untrained cognitive transfer tasks. It has been suggested that  transfer effects occur if training task and transfer task share specific processing  components that are supposedly processed in the same brain areas. In the current  study, we investigated whether single-task WM training and training-related  alterations in neural activity might support performance in a dual-task setting,  thus assessing transfer effects to higher-order control processes in the context of  dual-task coordination. A sample of older adults (age 60-72) was assigned to either  a training or control group. The training group participated in 12 sessions of an  adaptive n-back training. At pre and post-measurement, a multimodal dual-task was  performed in all participants to assess transfer effects. This task consisted of two  simultaneous delayed match to sample WM tasks using two different stimulus  modalities (visual and auditory) that were performed either in isolation  (single-task) or in conjunction (dual-task). A subgroup also participated in  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the performance of the n-back  task before and after training. While no transfer to single-task performance was  found, dual-task costs in both the visual modality (p < 0.05) and the auditory  modality (p < 0.05) decreased at post-measurement in the training but not in the  control group. In the fMRI subgroup of the training participants, neural activity  changes in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during one-back predicted  post-training auditory dual-task costs, while neural activity changes in right DLPFC  during three-back predicted visual dual-task costs. Results might indicate an  improvement in central executive processing that could facilitate both WM and  dual-task coordination.","2017","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","85","","","11","","Front Hum Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 28286477  PMCID: PMC5323430","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\LXQF7ITE\Heinzel et al. - 2017 - Transfer Effects to a Multimodal Dual-Task after W.pdf","","fMRI; working memory; aging; cognitive training; neuroimaging; dual-task; modality; transfer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, BOLD fMRI work has largely shifted to focus on WM and resting  functional connectivity following TBI. However, fundamental questions in WM remain.  Specifically, the effects of injury on the basic relationships between local and  interregional functional neuroimaging signals during WM processing early following  moderate to severe TBI have not been examined. This study employs a mixed effects  model to examine prefrontal cortex and parietal lobe signal change during a WM task,  the n-back, and whether there is covariance between regions of high amplitude signal  change, (synchrony of elicited activity (SEA) very early following TBI. We also  examined whether signal change and SEA differentially predict performance during WM.  Overall, percent signal change in the right prefrontal cortex (rPFC) was and  important predictor of both reaction time (RT) and SEA in early TBI and matched  controls. Right prefrontal cortex (rPFC) percent signal change positively predicted  SEA within and between persons regardless of injury status, suggesting that the link  between these neurodynamic processes in WM-activated regions remains unaffected even  very early after TBI. Additionally, rPFC activity was positively related to RT  within and between persons in both groups. Right parietal (rPAR) activity was  negatively related to RT within subjects in both groups. Thus, the local signal  intensity of the rPFC in TBI appears to be a critical property of network  functioning and performance in WM processing and may be a precursor to recruitment  observed in chronic samples. The present results suggest that as much research moves  toward large scale functional connectivity modeling, it will be essential to develop  integrated models of how local and distant neurodynamics promote WM performance  after TBI.","2015-06","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","285-301","","2","9","","Brain Imaging Behav","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 24906546","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\BGJI93FS\Medaglia et al. - 2015 - Modeling distinct imaging hemodynamics early after.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Neuropsychological Tests; Reaction Time; Brain Mapping/methods; Brain Injuries/*physiopathology; *Models, Neurological; Brain/blood supply/*physiopathology; Hemodynamics/*physiology; Cerebrovascular Circulation/*physiology; Neural Pathways/blood supply/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHOD: A total of 32 patients with  major depressive disorder, currently depressed, and 64 controls underwent structural  imaging with MRI. Also, 26 patients and 52 controls were examined using functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during performance of the n-back working memory  task. Structural and functional changes were evaluated using whole-brain,  voxel-based methods. RESULTS: The depressed patients showed volume reductions in the  sgACC and orbitofrontal cortex bilaterally, plus in both temporal poles and the  hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus on the left. Functional imaging revealed  task-related hypo-activation in the left lateral prefrontal cortex and other  regions, as well as failure of deactivation in a subcallosal medial frontal cortical  area which included the sgACC. CONCLUSIONS: Whole-brain, voxel-based analysis finds  evidence of both structural and functional abnormality in the sgACC in major  depressive disorder.

The power of functional response to the  task was estimated by sinusoidal regression at each voxel. The relationship between  power of fMRI response and mean reaction time over all 11 working memory trials was  explored by multiple regression, with age and mean reaction time to the control task  as covariates, at voxel and regional levels of analysis. All subjects were able to  perform the n-back task accurately. A spatially distributed network was activated,  including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, lateral premotor  cortex, and supplementary motor area (SMA) in the frontal lobes. More posteriorly,  there were major foci of activation in parietal and occipitoparietal cortex,  precuneus, lingual, and fusiform gyri of the ventral occipital lobe, inferior  temporal gyrus, and cerebellum. The power of functional response was positively  correlated with reaction time in bilateral posterior parietal cortex (Talairach  coordinates in x, y, z (mm) 35, -44, 37 and -32, -56, 42), indicating that subjects  who found the task difficult, and responded with a slower reaction time, tended to  activate these regions more powerfully. One interpretation of this regionally  specific relationship between prolonged reaction time and increased power of  posterior parietal activation is consistent with prior studies identifying similar  areas of parietal cortex as the site of the phonological storage function in verbal  working memory.","2000-11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","495-503","","5","12","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11034857","","","","Humans; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; Brain Mapping; Cerebral Cortex/physiology; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mental Recall/*physiology; Psychomotor Performance/physiology; Reaction Time/*physiology; Pattern Recognition, Visual/*physiology; Verbal Learning/*physiology; Attention/physiology; Parietal Lobe/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Performance accuracy on these tasks was  also measured. Brain activation patterns differed between MTBI patients and controls  in response to increasing WM processing loads. Controls maintained their ability to  increase activation in regions of WM circuitry with each increase in WM processing  load. MTBI patients showed disproportionately increased activation during the  moderate processing load condition, but very little increase in activation  associated with the highest processing load condition. Task performance did not  differ significantly between groups on any task condition. MTBI patients showed a  different pattern of allocation of processing resources associated with a high  processing load condition compared to healthy controls, despite similar task  performance.

Independent component  analysis (ICA) is the method of choice for generating a statistical image of the  ""default-mode"" network (DMN) using a task- and seed-independent distributed model of  fMRI functional connectivity without prior specification of node region extent and  timing of neural activation. We used a standard graded working-memory task (n-back)  to induce fMRI changes in the default-mode regions and ICA to evaluate to DMN  functional connectivity in nineteen healthy volunteers. Based on the known spatial  variability of the ICA-DMN maps with the task difficulty levels, we hypothesized the  ICA-DMN may also correlate with the subject performances. We confirmed that the  relative extent of the anterior and posterior midline spots within the DMN were  oppositely (resp. positively in the anterior and negatively in the posterior  cingulate cortex) correlated with the level of task difficulty and found out that  the spatial distribution of DMN also correlates with the individual task  performances. We conclude that the working-memory function is related to a spatial  re-configuration of the DMN functional connectivity, and that the relative  involvement of the cingulate regions within the DMN might function as a novel  predictor of the working-memory efficiency.","2009-03","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","11-20","","1-2","147","","Arch Ital Biol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Italy PMID: 19678593","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Young Adult; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Neuropsychological Tests; *Brain Mapping; Oxygen/blood; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods; Brain/blood supply/*physiology; Neural Pathways/blood supply/physiology; *Models, Neurological","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, we tested the hypothesis that  activations in the IPL during vowel memory tasks are associated with categorical  processing. Namely, activations due to categorical processing should be higher  during tasks performed on nonphonemic (hard to categorize) than on phonemic (easy to  categorize) vowels. As expected, we found distinct activation patterns during vowel  discrimination and vowel memory tasks. Further, these task-dependent activations  were different during tasks performed on phonemic or nonphonemic vowels.

However, the  effect of posture on many cognitive functions is still unknown. Therefore, the aim  of the present study was to investigate the effects of body posture (supine vs.  sitting) on one of the most frequently used paradigms in the cognitive sciences: the  N-back working memory paradigm. Twenty-two subjects were investigated in a  randomized within-subject design. Subjects performed the N-back task on two  consecutive days in either the supine or the upright posture. Subjective sleep  quality and chronic stress were recorded as covariates. Furthermore, changes in mood  dimensions and heart rate variability (HRV) were assessed during the experiment.  Results indicate that the quality of sleep strongly affects reaction times when  subjects performed a working memory task in a supine posture. These effects,  however, could not be observed in the sitting position. The findings can be  explained by HRV parameters that indicated differences in autonomic regulation in  the upright vs. the supine posture. The finding is of particular relevance for fMRI  group comparisons when group differences in sleep quality cannot be ruled out.","2014","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","171","","","8","","Front Hum Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 24723874  PMCID: PMC3973903","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\J5W2K7DY\Muehlhan et al. - 2014 - The effect of body posture on cognitive performanc.pdf","","fMRI; N-back; alertness; arousal; ECG; heart rate variability; posture; sleep quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present fMRI study  explores the activation pattern during an n-back working-memory task in patients  with an isolated cerebellar infarct. To determine each patient's cognitive  impairment, neuropsychological tests of working-memory and attention were carried  out. We conducted fMRI in nine patients and nine healthy age-matched controls while  they performed a 2-back task in a blocked-design. In both groups we found bilateral  activations in a widespread cortico-cerebellar network, consisting of the  ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 44, 45), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 9,  46), parietal cortex (BA 7, 40), pre-supplementary motor area (BA 6) anterior  cingulate (BA 32). Relative to healthy controls, patients with isolated cerebellar  infarcts demonstrated significantly more pronounced BOLD-activations in the  precuneus and the angular gyrus during the 2-back task. The significant increase in  activation in the posterior parietal areas of the cerebellar patients could be  attributed to a compensatory recruitment to maintain task performance.

METHODS: Ten patients with  childhood-onset SLE underwent formal neuropsychological testing and FMRI using 3  paradigms: a continuous performance task (CPT) to evaluate attention, an N-Back task  to assess working memory, and verb generation to evaluate language processing.  Composite Z maps were generated to summarize the brain activation patterns for each  FMRI paradigm in patients with childhood-onset SLE and to compare these patterns  with those observed in healthy controls. Between-group comparison Z maps showing  differences in activation between childhood-onset SLE patients and controls were  generated, using a significance level of P < 0.05 in a general linear model.  RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the childhood-onset SLE group showed  statistically significant increased activation of brain areas involved in the CPT,  N-Back, and verb generation tasks. In contrast, in the absence of active stimulus,  e.g., during times of the paradigm control tasks, childhood-onset SLE patients  consistently undersuppressed activity in the expected brain areas. Activation in  selected cortical areas was found to correlate negatively with results of a subset  of individual neuropsychological test scores. CONCLUSION: FMRI abnormalities are  present in childhood-onset SLE, manifesting as an imbalance between active and  inhibitory responses to an array of stimuli. Differences in brain activation  patterns compared with those observed in controls suggest that childhood-onset SLE  may be associated with abnormalities in white matter connectivity resulting in  neuronal network dysfunction, rather than injury of specific gray matter areas.","2007-12","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","4151-4163","","12","56","","Arthritis Rheum","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18050246","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\PERG8ZME\DiFrancesco et al. - 2007 - Functional magnetic resonance imaging assessment o.pdf","","Humans; Female; Child; Adolescent; Adult; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Cognition/*physiology; Case-Control Studies; Pilot Projects; Brain/pathology/*physiopathology; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/pathology/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the  hypothesis of gender differences in PFC function has not been elaborated, and  comparisons among hemodynamic parameters designed to test for gender differences are  scarce. We utilized near-infrared spectroscopy during verbal N-back tasks on 26 male  and 24 female healthy volunteers. Changes in the concentrations of oxy-  (Delta[oxy-Hb]), deoxy- (Delta[deoxy-Hb]) and total hemoglobin (Delta[tot-Hb]) were  recorded simultaneously. Delta[oxy-Hb] and Delta[tot-Hb] exhibited obvious gender  differences, but Delta[deoxy-Hb] did not. Males showed bilateral activation with  slight left-side dominance, whereas females showed left activation. The activation  in males was more wide-spread and stronger than in females. Furthermore, females  required a lower hemodynamic supply than males to obtain comparable performance, and  only females exhibited positive correlations between hemodynamic parameters and  behavioral performance. The results reinforce the existence of a gender effect in  hemodynamic-based functional imaging studies. Our findings suggest that females  possess more efficient hemodynamics in the PFC during working memory and emphasize  the importance of studying the PFC to further a scientific understanding of gender  differences.","2010-05-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","148-153","","1","209","","Behav Brain Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 20117145","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Adolescent; Young Adult; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Neuropsychological Tests; Oxygen/blood; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods; Statistics as Topic; Verbal Learning/*physiology; *Sex Characteristics; Oxyhemoglobins/metabolism; Hemodynamics/physiology; Prefrontal Cortex/*blood supply/*physiology; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared/methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although previous studies have shown that lateralized long-term memory  processes in the medial temporal lobes are modified in subjects with atypical  (right) language dominance, the effect of language dominance on the neural basis of  working memory (WM) has remained unknown. Here, we used functional MRI (fMRI) to  study the impact of language dominance on the neural representation of WM. We  conducted an n-back task in three different load conditions and with both verbal and  nonverbal (spatial) material in matched groups of left and right language dominant  subjects. This approach allowed us to investigate regions showing significant  interactions between language dominance and material. Overall, right dominant  subjects showed an increased inter-individual variability of WM-related activations.  Verbal WM involved more pronounced activation of the left fusiform cortex in left  dominant subjects and of the right inferior parietal lobule in the right dominant  group. Spatial WM, on the other hand, induced activation of right hemispheric  regions in left dominant subjects, but no specific activations in right dominant  subjects. Taken together, these findings indicate that the neural basis of verbal WM  processes depends on language dominance and is more mutable in right dominant  subjects. The increased variability in right dominant subjects strongly suggests  that a standard network of material-dependent WM processes exists in left dominant  subjects, and that right dominant subjects use variable alternative networks.","2009-07","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","2032-2043","","7","30","","Hum Brain Mapp","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc","","","","","","PMID: 18711708  PMCID: PMC6870824","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\3U3NU3IQ\Axmacher et al. - 2009 - Working memory representation in atypical language.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Brain Mapping; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Brain/*physiology; Analysis of Variance; *Language; Space Perception/physiology; Speech; *Functional Laterality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have shown previously that visual working memory benefits only from  intra-modal visual but not from across-modal auditory working memory training. In  the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study we examined whether auditory  working memory processes can also be trained specifically and which training-induced  activation changes accompany theses effects. It was investigated whether working  memory training with strongly distinct auditory materials transfers exclusively to  an auditory (intra-modal) working memory task or whether it generalizes to a  (across-modal) visual working memory task. We used adaptive n-back training with  tonal sequences and a passive control condition. The memory training led to a  reliable training gain. Transfer effects were found for the (intra-modal) auditory  but not for the (across-modal) visual transfer task. Training-induced activation  decreases in the auditory transfer task were found in two regions in the right  inferior frontal gyrus. These effects confirm our previous findings in the visual  modality and extents intra-modal effects in the prefrontal cortex to the auditory  modality. As the right inferior frontal gyrus is frequently found in maintaining  modality-specific auditory information, these results might reflect increased neural  efficiency in auditory working memory processes. Furthermore, task-unspecific  (amodal) activation decreases in the visual and auditory transfer task were found in  the right inferior parietal lobule and the superior portion of the right middle  frontal gyrus reflecting less demand on general attentional control processes. These  data are in good agreement with amodal activation decreases within the same brain  regions on a visual transfer task reported previously.","2012","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","173","","","6","","Front Hum Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 22701418  PMCID: PMC3373207","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\IPJHYF8A\Schneiders et al. - 2012 - The impact of auditory working memory training on .pdf","","fMRI; working memory; n-back task; training; auditory; plasticity; visual","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study we induced negative emotion using negative  olfactory stimulation while male (n=21) and female (n=19) participants performed an  n-back verbal working memory task. Based on findings indicating increased emotional  reactivity in women, we expected the female participants to exhibit stronger  activation in characteristically emotion-associated areas during the interaction of  emotional and cognitive processing in comparison to the male participants. Both  groups were found to be significantly impaired in their working memory performance  by negative emotion induction.

In women, the interaction between emotion  and working memory yielded a significantly stronger response in the amygdala and the  orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) compared to their male counterparts. Our data suggest  that in women the interaction of verbal working memory and negative emotion is  associated with relative hyperactivation in more emotion-associated areas whereas in  men regions commonly regarded as important for cognition and cognitive control are  activated.

Similar impairments are seen in various psychiatric  disorders that are associated with higher susceptibility to stress and with  prefrontal cortical dysfunctions, suggesting that acute stress may play a potential  role in such dysfunctions. However, it remains unknown whether acute stress has  immediate effects on WM-related prefrontal activity. METHODS: Using functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated neural activity of 27 healthy  female participants during a blocked WM task (numerical N-back) while moderate  psychological stress was induced by viewing strongly aversive (vs. neutral) movie  material together with a self-referencing instruction. To assess stress  manipulation, autonomic and endocrine, as well as subjective, measurements were  acquired throughout the experiment. RESULTS: Successfully induced acute stress  resulted in significantly reduced WM-related activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal  cortex (DLPFC), and was accompanied by less deactivation in brain regions that are  jointly referred to as the default mode network. CONCLUSIONS: This study  demonstrates that experimentally induced acute stress in healthy volunteers results  in a reduction of WM-related DLPFC activity and reallocation of neural resources  away from executive function networks. These effects may be explained by  supraoptimal levels of catecholamines potentially in conjunction with elevated  levels of cortisol. A similar mechanism involving acute stress as a mediating factor  may play an important role in higher-order cognitive deficits and hypofrontality  observed in various psychiatric disorders.","2009-07-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","25-32","","1","66","","Biol Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 19403118","","","","Humans; Female; Adolescent; Adult; Young Adult; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Neuropsychological Tests; Oxygen/blood; Reaction Time/physiology; Memory Disorders/*etiology/*pathology; Analysis of Variance; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods; Hydrocortisone/metabolism; Saliva/metabolism; Blood Pressure/physiology; Heart Rate/physiology; Prefrontal Cortex/blood supply/*physiopathology; Stress, Psychological/*complications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Earlier family studies have suggested that deficits in executive  cognition and working memory may be related to genetic susceptibility for  schizophrenia, but the biological basis for this behavioral phenotype has not been  identified. METHOD: The authors used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)  during performance of the N-back working memory task to assess working  memory-related cortical physiology in nonschizophrenic, cognitively intact siblings  of patients with schizophrenia. They compared 23 unaffected siblings of  schizophrenic patients to 18 matched comparison subjects. As a planned replication,  they studied another 25 unaffected siblings and 15 comparison subjects. RESULTS: In  both cohorts, there were no group differences in working memory performance.  Nevertheless, both groups of siblings showed an exaggerated physiological response  in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that was qualitatively similar to  results of earlier fMRI studies of patients with schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: These  fMRI data provide direct evidence of a primary physiological abnormality in  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex function in individuals at greater genetic risk for  schizophrenia, even in the absence of a manifest cognitive abnormality. This  exaggerated fMRI response implicates inefficient processing of memory information at  the level of intrinsic prefrontal circuitry, similar to earlier findings in patients  with schizophrenia. These data predict that inheritance of alleles that contribute  to inefficient prefrontal information processing will increase risk for  schizophrenia.","2003-04","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","709-719","","4","160","","Am J Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12668360","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\DSTDUTNP\Callicott et al. - 2003 - Abnormal fMRI response of the dorsolateral prefron.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Phenotype; Adult; Cohort Studies; Risk Factors; Neuropsychological Tests; Prefrontal Cortex/*physiology; Schizophrenic Psychology; Cognition/*physiology; Memory/physiology; Polymorphism, Genetic; Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*statistics & numerical data; *Siblings; Catechol O-Methyltransferase/genetics; Cognition Disorders/diagnosis/genetics; Functional Laterality/genetics/physiology; Schizophrenia/*diagnosis/*genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, even though  fNIRS is a very practical and well-tolerated method with several advantages  particularly in methodically challenging measurement situations (e.g., during tasks  involving movement or open speech), it has been shown to be confounded by systemic  compounds of non-cerebral, extra-cranial origin (e.g. changes in blood pressure,  heart rate). Especially event-related signal patterns induced by dilation or  constriction of superficial forehead and temple veins impair the detection of  frontal brain activation elicited by cognitive tasks. To further investigate this  phenomenon, we conducted a simultaneous fNIRS-fMRI study applying a working memory  paradigm (n-back). Extra-cranial signals were obtained by extracting the BOLD signal  from fMRI voxels within the skin. To develop a filter method that corrects for  extra-cranial skin blood flow, particularly intended for fNIRS data sets recorded by  widely used continuous wave systems with fixed optode distances, we identified  channels over the forehead with probable major extra-cranial signal contributions.  The averaged signal from these channels was then subtracted from all fNIRS channels  of the probe set. Additionally, the data were corrected for motion and non-evoked  systemic artifacts. Applying these filters, we can show that measuring brain  activation in frontal brain areas with fNIRS was substantially improved. The  resulting signal resembled the fMRI parameters more closely than before the  correction. Future fNIRS studies measuring functional brain activation in the  forehead region need to consider the use of different filter options to correct for  interfering extra-cranial signals.","2014-07-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","69-79","","","95","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Old subjects show increased  neural activity during the performance of tasks, mainly in prefrontal areas, which  is interpreted as a compensatory mechanism linked to functional brain efficiency.  Moreover, resting-state studies have concluded that elders show disconnection or  disruption of large-scale functional networks. We used functional MRI during  resting-state and a verbal n-back task with different levels of memory load in a  cohort of young and old healthy adults to identify patterns of networks associated  with working memory and brain default mode. We found that the disruption of  resting-state networks in the elderly coexists with task-related overactivations of  certain brain areas and with reorganizations within these functional networks.

Little is known how emotional salience of  task-irrelevant stimuli may modulate cognitive control of WM performance and  neurofunctional activation in MCI and AD individuals. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the  impact of emotional task-irrelevant visual stimuli on cortical activation during  verbal WM. METHODS: Twelve AD/MCI individuals and 12 age-matched healthy individuals  performed a verbal WM (nback-) task with task-irrelevant emotionally neutral and  emotionally negative background pictures during fMRI measurement. RESULTS: AD/MCI  individuals showed decreased WM performance compared with controls; both AD/MCI and  control groups reacted slower during presentation of negative pictures, regardless  of WM difficulty. The AD/MCI group showed increased activation in the left  hemispheric prefrontal network, higher amygdala and less cerebellar activation with  increasing WM task difficulty compared to healthy controls. Correlation analysis  between neurofunctional activation and WM performance revealed a negative  correlation between task sensitivity and activation in the dorsal anterior cingulum  for the healthy controls but not for the AD/MCI group. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest  compensatory activation in prefrontal cortex and amygdala, but also dysfunctional  inhibition of distracting information in the AD/MCI group during higher WM task  difficulty. Additionally, attentional processes affecting the correlation between WM  performance and neurofunctional activation seem to be different between incipient AD  and healthy aging.","2015","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","439-453","","2","44","","J Alzheimers Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 25352455","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brain Mapping; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Brain/*physiopathology; Photic Stimulation; working memory; Psychomotor Performance/physiology; Emotions/*physiology; cognitive control; Visual Perception/physiology; Alzheimer's disease; amygdala; Cognitive Dysfunction/*physiopathology/psychology; emotional interference; verbal n-back task","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined neural circuitry supporting emotion  regulation in females with either BDd or UDd as a first stage toward identifying  biomarkers that may differentiate BDd from UDd. METHOD: Fifty-seven females aged  18-45 years participated in this study: 23 with UDd, 18 with bipolar disorder type I  depression (BDId) and 16 healthy females. During 3-T functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI), the participants performed an emotional face n-back (EFNBACK) task,  that is an n-back task with high (2-back) and low (0-back) memory load conditions  flanked by two positive, negative or neutral face distracters. This paradigm  examines executive control with emotional distracters-emotion regulation. RESULTS:  High memory load with neutral face distracters elicited greater bilateral and left  dorsal anterior midcingulate cortex (dAMCC) activity in UDd than in healthy and BDId  females respectively, and greater bilateral putamen activity in both depressed  groups versus healthy females. High memory load with happy face distracters elicited  greater left putamen activity in UDd than in healthy females. Psychotropic  medication was associated with greater putamen activity to these contrasts in UDd  females. CONCLUSIONS: During high memory load with neutral face distracters,  elevated dAMCC activity in UDd suggests abnormal recruitment of attentional control  circuitry to maintain task performance, whereas elevated putamen activity unrelated  to psychotropic medication in BDId females may suggest an attentional bias toward  ambiguous neutral face distracters. Differential patterns of functional  abnormalities in neural circuitry supporting attentional control during emotion  regulation, especially in the dAMCC, is a promising neuroimaging measure to  distinguish UDd from BDId in females.","2012-07","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1417-1428","","7","42","","Psychol Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 22099606  PMCID: PMC3601380","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\SBTFSIRB\Bertocci et al. - 2012 - Abnormal anterior cingulate cortical activity duri.pdf","","Humans; Female; Adolescent; Adult; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Neuropsychological Tests; Brain Mapping/methods; Executive Function/*physiology; Task Performance and Analysis; Attention/physiology; Facial Expression; Cues; Benzodiazepines/therapeutic use; *Emotions; Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use; Bipolar Disorder/diagnosis/drug therapy/*physiopathology; Depressive Disorder/diagnosis/drug therapy/*physiopathology; Diagnosis, Differential; Gyrus Cinguli/drug effects/*physiopathology; Putamen/drug effects/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of the present  study was to examine amygdala response to threatening faces among healthy siblings  of schizophrenia patients in whom a subtler heritable deficit might be observed.  METHOD: Participants were 34 schizophrenia patients, 29 unaffected siblings, and 20  healthy comparison subjects. Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic  resonance imaging (fMRI) was conducted during an implicit facial information  processing task.

To date, few studies have investigated whether functional  interactions between brain regions are intact or altered. Using an established  verbal working memory paradigm with variable levels of memory load, we investigated  the modulatory effect of activity in cognitive control regions of the brain  (specifically the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) on activity in core working  memory regions, in particular the dorsal prefrontal cortex and the parietal lobe.  METHODS: Forty four subjects participated. An n-back task with two levels of working  memory load (1- and 2-back) was employed during fMRI (4 T Bruker MedSpec system).  Data were processed with SPM5 and the modulatory effects of the anterior cingulate  were investigated using psycho-physiological interaction (PPI). RESULTS: In spite of  only subtle activation differences, and no significant differences in performance  accuracy, a significant group x memory load interaction in the parietal lobe,  indicated aberrantly increased modulatory inputs to this region under conditions of  high working memory load in schizophrenia offspring. DISCUSSION: Increased  modulatory inputs from a central control region like the anterior cingulate  presumably reflect relative inefficiency in intra-cortical interactions in the  vulnerable brain. This inefficiency may reflect a developmentally mediated  impairment in functional brain interactions in this important vulnerable population.  It is highly plausible that the resultant effect of these altered interactions is an  increased vulnerability to impaired brain development, and therefore to psychiatric  disorders including schizophrenia.","2011-08","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1067-1076","","8","45","","J Psychiatr Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2011.

These temporal patterns differ in the  degree to which an exact stimulus onset may be predicted. We investigated whether  this experimental feature affects brain and behavior, and whether the impact is  modulated by the cognitive demands of a task. Subjects (N=26) were assessed via fMRI  while solving three different tasks under either temporally predictable (constant  ISI) or unpredictable (variable ISI) conditions. The tasks differed with regard to  demands on working memory and response uncertainty. Compared to constant ISIs,  variable (i.e., less predictable) ISIs led to a general increase in reaction time  and in right amygdala activation. Depending on the cognitive demands required by the  specific task, the left amygdala, the parietal cortex, the supplementary motor area,  and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were engaged as well. The results indicate  that the temporal structure in a stimulus sequence affects both overt and covert  behaviors. Implicit temporal uncertainty increases activation in several brain  regions depending on cognitive demands. Thus, an often-overlooked basic design  feature, the application of constant or variable ISIs, may contribute to  heterogeneity in cognitive neuroscience findings.","2014-11-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","236-244","","","101","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Several studies indicate that whereas severe stress impairs performance, moderate  stress can enhance cognitive performance. In this study, we investigated how  moderate stress influences the neural systems supporting working memory. We embedded  an N-back working memory task in a moderately stressful context, as indicated by our  physiological stress measures, and probed phasic and tonic human brain activity  using two fMRI-techniques: conventional blood oxygen level dependent fMRI and  arterial spin labeling (ASL). The results showed that the stress induction, as  compared to the neutral control condition, led to slightly faster reaction times  without changes in accuracy. In general, working memory processing was associated  with increased activity in a frontoparietal network and reduced activity in the  medial temporal lobe (MTL). The stress induction led to enhanced reduction of phasic  MTL responses, specifically the hippocampus and amygdala. In addition, ASL showed  that stress increased tonic amygdala activity, while tonic hippocampal activity was  unaffected. These findings suggest that the influence of stress on MTL deactivation  during working memory processing is task-related rather than a general consequence  of the stressful state. The temporal suspension of hippocampal processing in favor  of more task relevant processes may allow subjects to maintain normal performance  levels under moderate stress.","2012-01-16","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1161-1167","","2","59","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We studied six normal subjects  performing a working memory paradigm (n-back tasks) associated with different levels  of monetary reward during an fMRI session. The study showed specific brain  activation in relation with changes in both the cognitive loading and the reward  associated with task performance. First, the working memory tasks activated a  network including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [Brodmann area (BA) 9/46] and,  in addition, in the lateral frontopolar areas (BA 10), but only in the more  demanding condition (3-back task). This result suggests that lateral prefrontal  areas are organized in a caudo-rostral continuum in relation with the increase in  executive requirement. Second, reward induces an increased activation in the areas  already activated by working memory processing and in a supplementary region, the  medial frontal pole (BA 10), regardless of the level of cognitive processing. It is  postulated that the latter region plays a specific role in monitoring the reward  value of ongoing cognitive processes. Third, we detected areas where the signal  decreases (ventral-BA 11/47 and subgenual prefrontal cortices) in relation with both  the increase of cognitive demand and the reward. The deactivation may represent an  emotional gating aimed at inhibiting adverse emotional signals to maximize the level  of performance. Taken together, these results suggest a balance between increasing  activity in cortical cognitive areas and decreasing activity in the limbic and  paralimbic structures during ongoing higher cognitive processing.","2002-04-16","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","5669-5674","","8","99","","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 11960021  PMCID: PMC122829","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\LN7KYKB7\Pochon et al. - 2002 - The neural system that bridges reward and cognitio.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods; Brain Mapping/methods; *Cognition; Analysis of Variance; *Memory; Nerve Net; *Reward; Brain/*pathology/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in adolescents, some theories hypothesize a  neurobiological imbalance proposing heightened sensitivity to affective material in  the amygdala and striatum within a cognitive control context. Yet, direct  neurobiological evidence is scarce. Twenty-four adolescents (12-16) and 28 adults  (25-35) completed an emotional n-back working memory task in response to happy,  angry, and neutral faces during fMRI. Importantly, participants either paid  attention to the emotion (task-relevant condition) or judged the gender  (task-irrelevant condition). Behaviorally, for both groups, when happy faces were  task-relevant, performance improved relative to when they were task-irrelevant,  while performance decrements were seen for angry faces. In the dlPFC, angry faces  elicited more activation in adults during low relative to high cognitive load  (2-back vs. 0-back). By contrast, happy faces elicited more activation in the  amygdala in adolescents when they were task-relevant.

Creativity has been essential to the development of human civilization.  Previous studies from different fields have suggested creativity and capacity of WM  have opposing characteristics possibly in terms of diffuse attention. However,  despite a number of functional imaging studies on creativity, how creativity relates  to brain activity during WM has never been investigated. In this functional magnetic  resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we investigated this issue using an n-back WM  paradigm and a psychometric measure of creativity (a divergent thinking test). A  multiple regression analysis revealed that individual creativity was significantly  and positively correlated with brain activity in the precuneus during the 2-back  task (WM task), but not during the non-WM 0-back task. As the precuneus shows  deactivation during cognitive tasks, our findings show that reduced task induced  deactivation (TID) in the precuneus is associated with higher creativity measured by  divergent thinking. The precuneus is included in the default mode network, which is  deactivated during cognitive tasks. The magnitude of TID in the default mode network  is considered to reflect the reallocation of cognitive resources from networks  irrelevant to the performance of the task. Thus, our findings may indicate that  individual creativity, as measured by the divergent thinking test, is related to the  inefficient reallocation of attention, congruent with the idea that diffuse  attention is associated with individual creativity.","2011-03-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","681-687","","2","55","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: In this  double-blind crossover study, 20 smokers completed 8 days of treatment with  tolcapone and placebo. In both medication periods, smokers completed blood oxygen  level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI scans while performing a working memory N-back task  after 24h of abstinence. Smokers were genotyped prospectively for the COMT  val(158)met polymorphism for exploratory analysis. RESULTS: Compared to placebo,  tolcapone modestly improved accuracy (p=0.017) and enhanced suppression of  activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) (p=0.002). There were no  effects of medication in other a priori regions of interest (dorsolateral PFC,  dorsal cingulate/medial prefrontal cortex, or posterior cingulate cortex).  Exploratory analyses suggested that tolcapone led to a decrease in BOLD signal in  several regions among smokers with val/val genotypes, but increased or remained  unchanged among met allele carriers. Tolcapone did not attenuate craving, mood, or  withdrawal symptoms compared to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this  proof-of-concept study do not provide strong support for further evaluation of COMT  inhibitors as smoking cessation aids.","2013-12-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","852-856","","3","133","","Drug Alcohol Depend","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, the related neurobiological  correlates still deserve further investigation. The present study was aimed to  explore whether dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity during WM processing  was abnormal in euthymic bipolar patients and may represent a potential  trait-related phenotype associated with the disorder. METHODS: Using 3 Tesla  functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (3T fMRI), we studied 28 euthymic bipolar  patients (15 BDI and 13 BDII), and 27 healthy controls (HCs), matched for a series  of socio-demographic variables, while performing the N-back task for WM assessment.  RESULTS: We found that euthymic bipolar patients showed increased right middle  frontal gyrus engagement compared with HCs (FWE-corrected p = 1 × 10(-3)),  regardless of WM load, and in spite of similar WM behavioral performance between  groups. In particular, BDI patients had greater BOLD signal change compared to HCs  (post-hoc Tukey HSD, p = 1 × 10(-3)), while BDII patients expressed an intermediate  pattern of activation between BDI patients and HCs. No other significant effects  were detected in the corrected whole-brain analysis. LIMITATIONS: Sample size,  cross-sectional assessment and potential influence of some clinical variables.  CONCLUSIONS: Results provide direct evidence of a primary physiological abnormality  in DLPFC function in BDI and II, even in the absence of behavioral differences with  HCs. Such exaggerated fMRI response suggests inefficient WM processing in prefrontal  circuitry, and further studies are warranted to investigate whether the dysfunction  is related to the genetic risk for the disorder.","2015-09-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","116-122","","","184","","J Affect Disord","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Conventional antipsychotic drugs block DLPFC D2  receptors, and this may lead to further dysfunction and working memory impairments.  Aripiprazole is a D2 receptor partial agonist hypothesised to enhance PFC dopamine  functioning, possibly improving working memory. OBJECTIVES: We probed the  implications of the partial D2 receptor agonist actions of aripiprazole within the  DLPFC during working memory. Investigations were carried out in healthy volunteers  to eliminate confounds of illness or medication status. Aripiprazole's prefrontal  actions were compared with the D2/5-HT2A blocker risperidone to separate  aripiprazole's unique prefrontal D2 agonist actions from its serotinergic and  striatal D2 actions that it shares with risperidone. METHOD: A double-blind,  placebo-controlled, parallel design was implemented. Participants received a single  dose of either 5 mg aripiprazole, 1 mg risperidone or placebo before performing the  n-back task whilst undergoing fMRI scanning. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, the  aripiprazole group demonstrated enhanced DLPFC activation associated with a trend  for improved discriminability (d') and speeded reaction times. In contrast to  aripiprazole's neural effects, the risperidone group demonstrated a trend for  reduced DLPFC recruitment. Unexpectedly, the risperidone group demonstrated similar  effects to aripiprazole on d' and additionally had reduced errors of commission  compared with placebo. CONCLUSION: Aripiprazole has unique DLPFC actions attributed  to its prefrontal D2 agonist action. Risperidone's serotinergic action that results  in prefrontal dopamine release may have protected against any impairing effects of  its prefrontal D2 blockade.","2016-04","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1415-1426","","8","233","","Psychopharmacology (Berl)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 26900078  PMCID: PMC4819596","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\V5Q6TN5B\Murphy et al. - 2016 - An investigation into aripiprazole's partial D₂ ag.pdf","","Humans; Dopamine; Male; Adult; Working memory; Healthy Volunteers; Memory, Short-Term/*drug effects/physiology; Double-Blind Method; n-Back; Dopamine/metabolism; Aripiprazole; Antipsychotic; Antipsychotic Agents/pharmacology; Aripiprazole/*pharmacology; Corpus Striatum/metabolism; D2; Dorsolateral prefrontal; Partial agonism; Prefrontal Cortex/*drug effects/*metabolism; Receptors, Dopamine D2/*agonists; Risperidone; Risperidone/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Activation in the left dorsal aspect of the inferior parietal cortex  (DIPC) has been observed in contrasts of working memory load, whereas activation in  the ventral aspect of the inferior parietal cortex (VIPC) has been found primarily  in contrast of information type (verbal vs. nonverbal). Our goal was to determine  whether these two areas are functionally distinct or if instead they are part of a  homogeneous region with large variations in the focus of peak activity. Toward this  end, we used fMRI to assess the neural response in two working memory tasks (N-back  and item recognition) in which we also manipulated memory load and the type of  information to be recalled (verbal vs. nonverbal). We found both DIPC and VIPC  activation in the same group of subjects and further demonstrated that they have  differential sensitivity to our experimental factors. Only the DIPC showed robust  load effects, whereas only the VIPC showed reliable effects of information type.  These results help to account for the differences observed in between-subject  comparisons, and they indicate that the two regions are functionally dissociable. In  contrast to the DIPC, activity of the VIPC was also recruited in the fixation and  low-load conditions, a surprising result that has not been fully explored in prior  studies. Despite their distinctive patterns of performance, neither of these regions  displayed a pattern of activity that entirely corresponds to common assumptions of a  dedicated phonological short-term store (STS). Instead, we hypothesize that the DIPC  may support domain-general executive processes, while the VIPC may support  phonological encoding-recoding processes central to a variety of language tasks.","2004-06","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","562-573","","2","22","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15193584","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Language; Brain Mapping/methods; Memory/*physiology; Reproducibility of Results; Functional Laterality; Parietal Lobe/*physiology; Speech/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using functional connectivity, this network can be  conceptualized and studied as a ""stand-alone"" function or system. Regardless of the  task, independent component analysis (ICA) produces a picture of the ""default-mode""  function even when the subject is performing a simple sensori-motor task or just  resting in the scanner. This has boosted the use of default-mode fMRI for  non-invasive research in brain disorders. Here, we studied the effect of cognitive  load modulation of fMRI responses on the ICA-based pictures of the default-mode  function. In a standard graded working memory study based on the n-back task, we  used group-level ICA to explore the variability of the default-mode network related  to the engagement in the task, in 10 healthy volunteers. The analysis of the  default-mode components highlighted similarities and differences in the layout under  three different cognitive loads. We found a load-related general increase of  deactivation in the cortical network. Nonetheless, a variable recruitment of the  cingulate regions was evident, with greater extension of the anterior and lesser  extension of the posterior clusters when switching from lower to higher working  memory loads. A co-activation of the hippocampus was only found under no working  memory load. As a generalization of our results, the variability of the default-mode  pattern may link the default-mode system as a whole to cognition and may more  directly support use of the ICA model for evaluating cognitive decline in brain  disorders.","2006-10-16","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","263-269","","4-6","70","","Brain Res Bull","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17027761","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Time Factors; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; *Brain Mapping; Oxygen/blood; Memory, Short-Term/physiology; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods; Neuropsychological Tests/statistics & numerical data; Brain/blood supply/*physiology; Thinking/*physiology; *Neural Networks, Computer; *Principal Component Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A small literature has suggested a complex time course for functional  activation pattern changes following WM training (i.e. not simply increasing or  decreasing due to training); however, no study to date has examined such  neuroplastic effects in both the training task (dual n-back) and the fluid  intelligence transfer task to which the training is purported to transfer (Raven's  Matrices). This study investigated neural correlates of WM training in healthy young  adults randomized to six weeks of WM training, or an active control condition  (processing speed training) with a pre- and post-training fMRI design. Results  indicated significant reductions in activation for the WM trained group in key  WM-task related areas for trained WM tasks after training compared to the processing  speed active control group. The same pattern of training related decreases in  activation for the WM trained group was not observed for the transfer task, which is  consistent with null results for all cognitive outcomes of the present trial. The  observed pattern of results suggests that repetitive practice with a complex task  does indeed lead to neuroplastic processes that very likely represent the reduced  demand for attentional control while sub-components of the task become more  routinized with practice. We suggest that future research investigate neural  correlates of WM training in populations for which WM itself is impaired and/or  behavioural trials of WM training have returned more promising results.","2017-09-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","34-49","","","334","","Behav Brain Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may help identify neural  mechanisms underlying these deficits. Neuroimaging studies of healthy adults have  characterized responses associated with increased VWM demands during the n-Back  task, suggesting that this experimental paradigm could help identify neural  correlates of VWM deficits among MS patients. Fifteen MS patients and 15 matched  control participants completed the n-Back during whole-brain fMRI. Mean signal  during adjacent 0-Back blocks was subtracted, on a voxel-wise basis, from mean  signal observed during n-Back blocks. Resulting difference scores for 1-, 2-, and  3-Back were compared across groups and difficulty levels. Signal intensity was  positively related to difficulty level in anterior regions, including premotor,  supplementary motor, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. MS patients exhibited  significantly greater intensity in these areas compared to controls during the  1-Back, while portions of the left superior frontal gyrus, cingulate, and  parahippocampal gyri were relatively less intense at more difficult levels. MS group  responses were slower during the 1-Back and tended to be slower during the 3-Back;  however, accuracy did not differ at any level. Lesion load was positively related to  only 1-Back activity and unrelated to any performance measure. Results suggest that  compensatory activity occurs among MS patients matched on performance accuracy.  Furthermore, compensatory activity occurs predominantly in regions associated with  VWM, and this may decline relative to controls as task demands increase. These  findings may help to explain why MS patient performance decreases as a function of  effort on neuropsychological tests.","2006-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","28-36","","1","27","","Hum Brain Mapp","","","","","","","","eng","Hum Brain Mapp, 2005.

Performance of mild TBI patients did not differ  from controls; patients with moderate and severe TBI were impaired, relative to  controls and mild TBI patients, but only at higher WM-load levels. fMRI results show  that TBI patients exhibit altered patterns of activation in a number of WM-related  brain regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and Broca's area.  Examination of the pattern of behavioral responding and the temporal course of  activations suggests that WM deficits in moderate-to-severe TBI are due to  associative or strategic aspects of WM, and not impairments in active maintenance of  stimulus representations.

OBJECTIVE: To test for  differences in BOLD signal activation between subjects with OTCD and healthy  controls during a working memory task. DESIGN, SETTING AND PATIENTS: Nineteen  subjects with OTCD and 21 healthy controls participated in a case-control,  IRB-approved study at Georgetown University Medical Center. INTERVENTION: An N-back  working memory task was performed in a block design using 3T functional magnetic  resonance imaging. RESULTS: In subjects with OTCD we observed increased BOLD signal  in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex  (ACC) relative to healthy age matched controls. CONCLUSIONS: Increased neuronal  activation in OTCD subjects despite equivalent task performance points to  sub-optimal activation of the working memory network in these subjects, most likely  reflecting damage caused by hyperammonemic events. These increases directly relate  to our previous finding of reduced frontal white matter integrity in the superior  extents of the corpus callosum; key hemispheric connections for these areas. Future  studies using higher cognitive load are required to further characterize these  effects.","2013-04","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","753-761","","4","34","","Hum Brain Mapp","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","","","","PMID: 22110002  PMCID: PMC3338900","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\MPBGIHVV\Gropman et al. - 2013 - Altered neural activation in ornithine transcarbam.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Oxygen/blood; Cognition/*physiology; Memory, Short-Term/physiology; Executive Function/*physiology; Case-Control Studies; Cerebral Cortex/*blood supply; Ornithine Carbamoyltransferase Deficiency Disease/*pathology/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast, single-unit recording studies in monkeys have  demonstrated a relationship between extrastriate visual areas and visual working  memory tasks. In this study we tested whether activity in both the PFC and fusiform  face area (FFA) changed with increasing demands of an n-back task for gray-scale  faces. Since stimulus presentation was identical across conditions, the n-back task  allowed us to parametrically vary working memory demands across conditions while  holding perceptual and motor demands constant. This study replicated the result of  PFC areas of activation that increased directly with load n of the task. The novel  finding in all subjects was FFA activation that also increased directly with load n  of the task. Since perceptual demands were equivalent across the three task  conditions, these findings suggest that activity in both the PFC and the FFA vary  with face working memory demands.","2001-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","355-364","","3","10","","Brain Res Cogn Brain Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 11167061","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Brain Mapping; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Parietal Lobe/physiology; Prefrontal Cortex/physiology; Linear Models; Visual Cortex/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is unclear if these abnormalities are present  in unmedicated remitted depressed patients. To address this question, the current  study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in combination with a  simple verbal n-back task, in a cohort of unmedicated remitted depressed patients.  METHOD: We studied 15 healthy control subjects (HC) and 15 unmedicated remitted  depressed patients (rMDD). Participants performed a verbal working memory task of  varying cognitive load (n-back) while undergoing fMRI. We used multiple regression  analyses to assess overall capacity (1-, 2-, 3-back versus 0-back) as well as  quadratic modulation of cognitive demand. RESULTS: Performance accuracy and response  latency did not differ between groups, and overall capacity was similar. However,  rMDD showed a positive quadratic load response in the bilateral hippocampus; the  converse was true for HC. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that remitted depression was  associated with a perturbed pattern of activation in the bilateral hippocampus  during a verbal working memory task.

The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to  directly compare whether these PFC regions show selective activation associated with  one memory domain. In a within-subjects design, subjects performed the n-back WM  task (two-back condition) as well as LTM encoding (intentional memorization) and  retrieval (yes-no recognition) tasks. Additionally, each task was performed with two  different types of stimulus materials (familiar words, unfamiliar faces) in order to  determine the influence of material-type vs task-type. A bilateral region of  dorsolateral PFC (DL-PFC; BA 46/9) was found to be selectively activated during the  two-back condition, consistent with a hypothesized role for this region in active  maintenance and/or manipulation of information in WM. Left frontopolar PFC (FP-PFC)  was also found to be selectively engaged during the two-back. Although FP-PFC  activity has been previously associated with retrieval from LTM, no frontopolar  regions were found to be selectively engaged by retrieval. Finally, lateralized  ventrolateral PFC (VL-PFC) regions were found to be selectively engaged by  material-type, but uninfluenced by task-type. These results highlight the importance  of examining PFC activity across multiple memory domains, both for functionally  differentiating PFC regions (e.g., task-selectivity vs material-selectivity in  DL-PFC and VL-PFC) and for testing the applicability of memory domain-specific  theories (e.g., FP-PFC in LTM retrieval).","2001-07","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","48-59","","1 Pt 1","14","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11525336","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Brain Mapping; Prefrontal Cortex/*physiology; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Reference Values; Mental Recall/*physiology; Pattern Recognition, Visual/*physiology; Verbal Learning/*physiology; Dominance, Cerebral/physiology; Retention, Psychology/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PARTICIPANTS: Forty-eight male smokers were randomized to receive five injections  with either 400 μg/ml of the 3'-aminomethylnicotine Pseudomonas aeruginosa  r-Exoprotein-conjugated vaccine or placebo. Subjects were tested on two occasions,  once after a nicotine challenge and once after a placebo challenge, and were asked  to refrain from smoking 10 hours before testing. MEASUREMENTS: Reaction-times and  accuracies were recorded during an n-back task. Moreover, regional blood oxygenated  level-dependent (BOLD) response was measured during this task and during smoking cue  exposure. FINDINGS: Greater activation was found in response to smoking cues  compared to neutral cues in bilateral trans-occipital sulcus (P < 0.005); however,  this effect did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. There was no  difference in brain activity to smoking cues between the treatment groups and no  effects of acute nicotine challenge were established. For the n-back task we found  working memory load-sensitive increases in brain activity in several frontal and  parietal areas (P < 0.0025).

In the current  study, we examined whether the range of functional modulation observed over multiple  levels of WM task difficulty (N-Back) predicts in-scanner task performance and  out-of-scanner psychometric estimates of WM capacity. Within our sample (60-77years  of age), age was negatively associated with frontoparietal modulation range.  Individuals with greater modulation range exhibited more accurate N-Back  performance. In addition, despite a lack of significant relationships between N-Back  and complex span task performance, range of frontoparietal modulation during the  N-Back significantly predicted domain-general estimates of WM capacity. Consistent  with previous cross-sectional findings, older individuals with less modulation range  exhibited greater activation at the lowest level of task difficulty but less  activation at the highest levels of task difficulty.

To test this, we addressed the possible interaction between cognitive  task performance and endogenous fMRI oscillations in an experiment designed to  answer two questions: 1) Does performance of a cognitively effortful task  significantly change fractal scaling properties of fMRI time series compared to  their values before task performance? 2) If so, can we relate the extent of  task-related perturbation to the difficulty of the task? METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL  FINDINGS: Using a novel continuous acquisition ""rest-task-rest"" design, we found  that endogenous dynamics tended to recover their pre-task parameter values  relatively slowly, over the course of several minutes, following completion of one  of two versions of the n-back working memory task and that the rate of recovery was  slower following completion of the more demanding (n = 2) version of the task.  CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This result supports the model that endogenous low  frequency oscillatory dynamics are relevant to the brain's response to exogenous  stimulation.

A small number of  studies have also shown that relatively short exposure to blue light leads to  changes in functional brain responses during the period of exposure. The extent to  which blue light continues to affect brain functioning during a cognitively  challenging task after cessation of longer periods of exposure (i.e., roughly 30  minutes or longer), however, has not been fully investigated. METHODS: A total of 35  healthy participants (18 female) were exposed to either blue (469 nm) (n = 17) or  amber (578 nm) (n = 18) wavelength light for 30 minutes in a darkened room, followed  immediately by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while undergoing a  working memory task (N-back task). RESULTS: Participants in the blue light condition  were faster in their responses on the N-back task and showed increased activation in  the dorsolateral (DLPFC) and ventrolateral (VLPFC) prefrontal cortex compared to  those in the amber control light condition. Furthermore, greater activation within  the VLPFC was correlated with faster N-back response times. CONCLUSIONS: This is the  first study to suggest that a relatively brief, single exposure to blue light has a  subsequent beneficial effect on working memory performance, even after cessation of  exposure, and leads to temporarily persisting functional brain changes within  prefrontal brain regions associated with executive functions. These findings may  have broader implication for using blue-enriched light in a variety of work settings  where alertness and quick decision-making are important.","2016-09-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1671-1680","","9","39","","Sleep","","","","","","","","eng","© 2016 Associated Professional Sleep Societies, LLC.","","","","","","PMID: 27253770  PMCID: PMC4989256","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\V26H62BK\Alkozei et al. - 2016 - Exposure to Blue Light Increases Subsequent Functi.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Young Adult; Brain Mapping; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; *fMRI; *working memory; *N-back task; Reaction Time/physiology; Attention/physiology; *functional magnetic resonance imaging; *prefrontal cortex; Prefrontal Cortex/diagnostic imaging/*physiology; *amber light; *blue light; *Light; *PFC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This could be the consequence of a functional  deficit in regions of cortex that are associated with WM function in healthy adults.  In order to investigate this assertion, ten patients with a diagnosis of MDD and ten  matched healthy controls undertook a parametric WM task (i.e. the n-back task)  during the acquisition of blood oxygen level dependent echo planar magnetic  resonance images (BOLD EPI fMRI). There was no significant difference in the  behavioral performance of depressed patients and controls. This was true for both  accuracy and reaction time on the n-back task. Random effects analysis of the  functional imaging data (using SPM99) revealed a significant difference in  load-dependent activation in the medial orbitofrontal cortex/rostral anterior  cingulate between patients and controls (cluster size (K(E))/volume = 128/1024 mm3,  P(corrected) = 0.025). While both participant groups exhibited a significant  decrease in activation in this region with increased task difficulty, the magnitude  of this decrease was smaller in patients with MDD than in controls. Therefore, this  study implies that the performance of WM tasks is associated with a dysfunctional  activation of the medial orbitofrontal and rostral anterior cingulate cortex in MDD.  The study thus offers a rationale for explaining depressive cognitive impairment by  the abnormal fronto-limbic activation found in clinical depression.","2006-01-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","203-215","","1","29","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16157491","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Oxygen/blood; Psychomotor Performance/*physiology; Memory, Short-Term/physiology; Reaction Time/physiology; Reading; Echo-Planar Imaging; Attention/physiology; Cerebral Cortex/physiopathology; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Affect/physiology; Depressive Disorder, Major/*physiopathology/*psychology; Limbic System/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The technique provides individual, rather than  group-averaged, functional neuroimaging data, but subtle methodological confounds  represent unique challenges for psychiatric research. As an exemplar of the unique  potential and problems of fMRI, we present a study of 10 inpatients with  schizophrenia and 10 controls performing a novel ""n back"" working memory (WM) task.  We emphasize two key design steps: (1) the use of an internal activation standard  (i.e., a physiological control region) to address activation validity, and (2) the  assessment of signal stability to control for ""activation"" artifacts arising from  unequal signal variance across groups. In the initial analysis, all but one of the  patients failed to activate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during the  working memory task. However, some patients (and one control) also tended to show  sparse control region activation in spite of normal motor performance, a result that  raises doubts about the validity of the initial analysis and concerns about unequal  subject motion. Subjects were then matched for signal variance (voxel stability),  producing a subset of six patients and six controls. In this comparison, the  internal activation standard (i.e., motor activation) was similar in both groups,  and five of six patients, including two whom were neuroleptic-naive, failed to  activate DLPFC. In addition, a tendency for overactivation of parietal cortex was  seen. These results illustrate some of the promise and pitfalls of fMRI. Although  fMRI generates individual brain maps, a specialized survey of the data is necessary  to avoid spurious or unreliable findings, related to artifacts such as motion, which  are likely to be frequent in psychiatric patients.","1998-03","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","186-196","","3","18","","Neuropsychopharmacology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 9471116","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\EQT9STHR\Callicott et al. - 1998 - Functional magnetic resonance imaging brain mappin.pdf","","Humans; Male; Adult; Brain Mapping; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Brain/*pathology/physiopathology; *Echo-Planar Imaging; Schizophrenia/*pathology/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These cognitive impairments  have been linked to increased risk for relapse. Little is known about individual  differences in the cognitive impairments that accompany deprivation or the neural  processing reflected in those differences. In order to address this knowledge gap,  we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 118  nicotine-deprived smokers while they performed a verbal n-back task. We predicted  better performance would be associated with more efficient patterns of brain  activation and effective connectivity. Results indicated that performance was  positively related to load-related activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal  cortex and the left lateral premotor cortex. Additionally, effective connectivity  patterns differed as a function of performance, with more accurate participants  having simpler, more parsimonious network models than did worse participants.  Cognitive efficiency is typically thought of as less neural activation for equal or  superior behavioral performance. Taken together, findings suggest cognitive  efficiency should not be viewed solely in terms of amount of activation but that  both the magnitude of activation within and degree of covariation between  task-critical structures must be considered. This research highlights the benefit of  combining traditional fMRI analysis with newer methods for modeling brain  connectivity. These results suggest a possible role for indices of network  functioning in assessing relapse risk in quitting smokers as well as offer  potentially useful targets for novel intervention strategies.","2014-09","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","931-940","","5","19","","Addict Biol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2013 Society for the Study of Addiction.","","","","","","PMID: 23573872  PMCID: PMC3711955","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\TAJQEHHW\Nichols et al. - 2014 - Greater BOLD activity but more efficient connectiv.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Neuropsychological Tests; Brain/*physiopathology; fMRI; connectivity; working memory; Memory, Short-Term/physiology; Recurrence; Addiction; Smoking Cessation/psychology; Smoking/*physiopathology; Nicotinic Agonists/pharmacology; Cognition Disorders/*physiopathology; Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/*physiopathology; individual differences; Nicotine/pharmacology; smoking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Abnormalities in neural areas supporting attentional control and emotion  processing in remitted depressed (rMDD) patients suggests that there may be  enduring, trait-like abnormalities in key neural circuits at the interface of  cognition and emotion, but this issue has not been studied systematically. METHOD:  Nineteen euthymic, medication-free rMDD patients (mean age 33.6 years; mean duration  of illness 34 months) and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC; mean age  35.8 years) performed the Emotional Face N-Back (EFNBACK) task, a working memory  task with emotional distracter stimuli. We used blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure neural activity in the  dorsolateral (DLPFC) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), orbitofrontal  cortex (OFC), ventral striatum and amygdala, using a region of interest (ROI)  approach in SPM2. RESULTS: rMDD patients exhibited significantly greater activity  relative to HC in the left DLPFC [Brodmann area (BA) 9/46] in response to negative  emotional distracters during high working memory load. By contrast, rMDD patients  exhibited significantly lower activity in the right DLPFC and left VLPFC compared to  HC in response to positive emotional distracters during high working memory load.  These effects occurred during accurate task performance. CONCLUSIONS: Remitted  depressed patients may continue to exhibit attentional biases toward negative  emotional information, reflected by greater recruitment of prefrontal regions  implicated in attentional control in the context of negative emotional information.","2012-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","29-40","","1","42","","Psychol Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 21733287","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\64P9LDP3\Kerestes et al. - 2012 - Abnormal prefrontal activity subserving attentiona.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Reaction Time; Oxygen/blood; Prefrontal Cortex/*physiopathology; Depressive Disorder, Major/*physiopathology/psychology; Emotions/*physiology; Photic Stimulation/methods; Case-Control Studies; Attention/*physiology; Analysis of Variance; Functional Laterality; Facial Expression; Regression Analysis; Basal Ganglia/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thirty-seven schizophrenia patients (17 with past SA and 20  without) and 32 controls (12 with past SA and 20 without) completed two versions of  a two-back WM task during fMRI scanning on separate days.

These regions were significantly more active in  controls with past SA compared to controls without past SA. Schizophrenia patients  with or without past SA either showed no significant differences, or patients with  past SA showed somewhat less activation compared to patients without past SA during  WM. These results suggest robust effects of past SA on WM brain functioning in  controls, but less impact of past SA in schizophrenia.

We identified characteristics of working memory capacity using functional magnetic  resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy subjects. Working memory capacity was studied  using a parametric 'n-back' working memory task involving increasing cognitive load  and ultimately decreasing task performance. Loci within dorsolateral prefrontal  cortex (DLPFC) evinced exclusively an 'inverted-U' shaped neurophysiological  response from lowest to highest load, consistent with a capacity-constrained  response. Regions outside of DLPFC, in contrast, were more heterogeneous in response  and often showed early plateau or continuously increasing responses, which did not  reflect capacity constraints. However, sporadic loci, including in the premotor  cortex, thalamus and superior parietal lobule, also demonstrated putative  capacity-constrained responses, perhaps arising as an upstream effect of DLPFC  limitations or as part of a broader network-wide capacity limitation. These results  demonstrate that regionally specific nodes within the working memory network are  capacity-constrained in the physiological domain, providing a missing link in  current explorations of the capacity characteristics of working memory.","1999-02","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","20-26","","1","9","","Cereb Cortex","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10022492","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\R8QCKHPL\Callicott et al. - 1999 - Physiological characteristics of capacity constrai.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Reference Values; *Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods; Memory/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lesion studies and functional blood flow-dependent imaging methods  with coarse temporal resolution, such as PET and functional MRI (fMRI), tend to  paint a fairly static picture of the cortical regions involved. In contrast,  functional transcranial Doppler sonography (fTCD) provides a high temporal  resolution. Truly simultaneous fTCD-fMRI is not yet possible for technical reasons,  but H(2)(15)O PET and fTCD can be used really simultaneously. However, this  combination has not yet been used for cognitive activations in schizophrenia. We  therefore investigated the extent to which there are both spatial (PET) and temporal  changes (fTCD) in the activation patterns of schizophrenic patients. METHODS: Eleven  clinically stable chronic schizophrenic, right-handed patients and 10 healthy,  right-handed control subjects, matched for age, sex, education, and intelligence  quotient, participated in the study. We selected stable chronic schizophrenic  patients who could perform a working memory task (N-back task) as well as healthy  volunteers to exclude the possibility of imaged artifacts due to poor performance.  All subjects were examined with a truly simultaneous fTCD-H(2)(15)O PET combination  under cognitive activation. RESULTS: Schizophrenic patients activate a significantly  larger cortical volume for adequate task performance (P < 0.05), but with a  significantly lower blood flow increase in this volume (P < 0.01), than do control  subjects. Furthermore, they cannot significantly increase blood flow velocity during  the time course of cognitive activation as control subjects do. There were only  significant correlations between neuropsychologic performance and imaging parameters  (fTCD changes, PET blood flow changes) in control subjects (all r >or= /0.65/; P <  0.05), but no significant correlations in schizophrenics (all r < /0.3/; P > 0.4).  CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that schizophrenic patients exhibit qualitative  differences in the spatial and temporal resolution of cognitive processing. All  facts could be interpreted as a sign of alternative, less efficient problem-solving  strategies in schizophrenia that lead to the working memory deficits observed during  the further course of this disease. Truly simultaneous fTCD-PET can be used in  neuroscience to add fundamental new information on spatial and temporal cognitive  activation behavior to understand the true physiologic nature of the  disease-specific differences of mental illnesses that are seen as disorders of the  mind arising in the brain.","2003-05","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","671-681","","5","44","","J Nucl Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12732667","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; *Cognition; Cerebrovascular Circulation; *Tomography, Emission-Computed; *Ultrasonography, Doppler, Transcranial; Schizophrenia/*diagnostic imaging/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, patients were pre-selected on the basis of intact  performance on a relatively low-load verbal working memory task, in order to  mitigate against performance confounds. Subjects included 20 right-handed male  subjects with chronic schizophrenia, and 20 right-handed, age-matched, male healthy  controls, without personal or familial psychiatric history. All subjects underwent  fMRI scanning whilst performing a verbal n-back task. There were no significant  between-group differences in target identification; the patient group showed a  significantly increased mean response latency. Both groups demonstrated robust  fronto-parietal activation. In the control subjects, the power of functional  response was positively correlated with reaction time in bilateral posterior  parietal cortex, however, this coupling of behavioural performance and cerebral  response was not evident in the patients.

In rodents, such effects  are mediated by stress-induced alterations in catecholaminergic signaling, but human  data in support of this notion is lacking. A common variation in the gene encoding  Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is known to affect basal catecholaminergic  availability and PFC functions. Here, we investigated whether this genetic variation  (Val158Met) modulates effects of stress on WM-related neural activity in humans. In  a counterbalanced crossover design, 41 healthy young men underwent functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a numerical N-back WM task  embedded in a stressful or neutral context. Moderate psychological stress was  induced by a well-controlled procedure involving viewing strongly aversive (versus  emotionally neutral) movie material in combination with a self-referencing  instruction. Acute stress resulted in genotype-dependent effects on WM performance  and WM-related activation in the dorsolateral PFC, with a relatively negative impact  of stress in COMT Met-homozygotes as opposed to a relatively positive effect in  Val-carriers. A parallel interaction was found for WM-related deactivation in the  anterior medial temporal lobe (MTL). Our findings suggest that individuals with  higher baseline catecholaminergic availability (COMT Met-homozygotes) appear to  reach a supraoptimal state under moderate levels of stress. In contrast, individuals  with lower baselines (Val-carriers) may reach an optimal state. Thus, our data show  that effects of acute stress on higher-order cognitive functions vary depending on  catecholaminergic availability at baseline, and thereby corroborate animal models of  catecholaminergic signaling that propose a non-linear relationship between  catecholaminergic activity and prefrontal functions.","2012","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","16","","","6","","Front Integr Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 22593737  PMCID: PMC3350069","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\UZCXU8SR\Qin et al. - 2012 - The effect of moderate acute psychological stress .pdf","","fMRI; working memory; prefrontal cortex; stress; Catechol-O-methyltransferase; catecholamine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there have been few studies of adults  at genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease prior to the onset of symptoms. The purpose  of this study was to determine whether brain activation patterns associated with  working memory differ as a function of apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype in  cognitively intact adults. METHOD: Participants were cognitively intact, healthy  adults who completed genotyping, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and  structural and functional neuroimaging. Twenty-two participants had the APOE  epsilon3/epsilon3 genotype, and 13 participants had the APOE epsilon3/epsilon4  genotype. The study employed an auditory verbal N-back task to probe working  memory-related brain activity. RESULTS: The epsilon3/epsilon3 and epsilon3/epsilon4  groups did not differ in demographic characteristics, cognitive ability, mood, or  in-scanner task performance. The epsilon3/epsilon4 group showed greater activity  during working memory in the medial frontal and parietal regions bilaterally and in  the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. There were no regions in which the  epsilon3/epsilon3 group showed greater activation than the epsilon3/epsilon4 group.  CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that differences in brain activity are evident  in cognitively intact individuals who are at risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease  by virtue of their APOE allele status. As neuroprotective interventions become  available, early detection will increase in importance. The combination of genetic  and functional neuroimaging strategies may prove useful for monitoring individuals  at risk for Alzheimer's disease before the onset of cognitive symptoms.","2006-09","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1603-1610","","9","163","","Am J Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16946187","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\W39T9YBF\Wishart et al. - 2006 - Increased brain activation during working memory i.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Alleles; Genotype; Adult; Aged; Risk Factors; Neuropsychological Tests; Cognition/*physiology; Parietal Lobe/physiology; Brain/*physiology; Psychomotor Performance/physiology; Memory/*physiology; Prefrontal Cortex/physiology; Functional Laterality/physiology; Task Performance and Analysis; Verbal Behavior/physiology; Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics; Apolipoprotein E3; Apolipoprotein E4; Apolipoproteins E/*genetics; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, at high concentrations, iron may induce oxidative stress and inflammation. Brain iron  overload has been shown in various neurodegenerative disorders and in normal aging.  Elevated brain iron in old age may trigger brain dysfunction and concomitant  cognitive decline. However, the exact mechanism underlying the deleterious impact of  iron on brain function in aging is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of iron  on brain function across the adult lifespan from 187 healthy participants (20-79  years old, 99 women) who underwent fMRI scanning while performing a working-memory  n-back task. Iron content was quantified using R2* relaxometry, whereas  neuroinflammation was estimated using myo-inositol measured by magnetic resonance  spectroscopy. Striatal iron increased non-linearly with age, with linear increases  at both ends of adulthood. Whereas higher frontostriatal activity was related to  better memory performance independent of age, the link between brain activity and  iron differed across age groups. Higher striatal iron was linked to greater  frontostriatal activity in younger, but reduced activity in older adults. Further  mediation analysis revealed that, after age 40, iron provided unique and shared  contributions with neuroinflammation to brain activations, such that  neuroinflammation partly mediated brain-iron associations. These findings promote a  novel mechanistic understanding of how iron may exert deleterious effects on brain  function and cognition with advancing age.","2021-04-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","117792","","","230","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021.

In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging during an n-back WM task at  different WM load levels was applied to compare blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)  responses between younger and older participants and to predict gains in WM  performance after a subsequent 12-session WM training procedure in older adults.

Furthermore, at low difficulty levels, decreases in BOLD response were found after  WM training.

A better understanding of how dopamine  changes thalamo-cortical communication may shed light on how dopamine supports  cognitive function. Methylphenidate has been shown to facilitate cognitive  processing and reduce connectivity between the thalamus and lateral prefrontal  cortex. AIMS: The thalamus is a heterogeneous structure, and the present study  sought to clarify how the intrinsic connections of thalamic sub-regions are  differentially impacted by acute dopamine transporter blockade. METHODS: Sixty  healthy volunteers were orally administered either 20 mg of methylphenidate (N = 29)  or placebo (N = 31) in a double-blind, randomized, between-subject design.  Multi-echo fMRI was used to assess intrinsic functional connectivity of sub-regions  of the thalamus during a resting state scan. An N-back working-memory paradigm  provided a measure of cognitive performance. RESULTS: Acute methylphenidate  significantly reduced connectivity of the lateral prefrontal cortex with the motor  and somatosensory sub-regions of the thalamus and reduced connectivity with the  parietal and visual sub-regions at a trend level. Connectivity with the premotor,  prefrontal, and temporal sub-regions was not impacted. The intrinsic connectivity  between the thalamus and the lateral prefrontal cortex was not associated with  working-memory performance. CONCLUSIONS: Methylphenidate decreases functional  connections between the lateral prefrontal cortex and thalamus broadly, while  sparing intrinsic connectivity with thalamic sub-regions involved with  working-memory and language related processes. Collectively, our results suggest  that the dopamine transporter regulates functional connections between the  prefrontal cortex and non-cognitive areas of the thalamus.","2020-06","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1873-1883","","6","237","","Psychopharmacology (Berl)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 32307560  PMCID: PMC7437544","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\HZ99MTY3\Gorka et al. - 2020 - Intrinsic connections between thalamic sub-regions.pdf","","Humans; Dopamine; Female; Male; Adult; Young Adult; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods; Healthy Volunteers; Memory, Short-Term/*drug effects/physiology; Double-Blind Method; Prefrontal cortex; Acute methylphenidate; Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors/administration & dosage; Intrinsic functional connectivity; Methylphenidate/*administration & dosage; Nerve Net/diagnostic imaging/*drug effects/physiology; Prefrontal Cortex/diagnostic imaging/*drug effects/physiology; Resting state fMRI; Thalamus; Thalamus/diagnostic imaging/*drug effects/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Comparing negative with neutral distraction at low WM load,  older adults demonstrated shorter reaction times (RT) and reduced activation in  frontoparietal regions: bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and left parietal  cortex. They also had greater coherence within the frontoparietal network, as well  as greater deactivation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala.  These patterns probably contributed to the older adults' diminished distractibility  by negative task-irrelevant stimuli. Since recruitment of control mechanisms was  less required, the frontoparietal network was less activated and performance was  improved. Faster RT during the negative condition was related to lesser activation  of the MFG in both age groups, corroborating the functional significance of this  region to WM across the lifespan.","2017-05","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","93-102","","","53","","Neurobiol Aging","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In order to study multi-level effects of genotype and anxiety,  prefrontal cortex activity during an emotional n-back task was measured in 66  volunteers genotyped for the NPSR1 rs324981 A/T variant (AA homozygotes vs. T allele  carriers) by means of functional near-infrared spectroscopy. For a high working  memory load (3-back), T allele carriers showed a signal increase to negative  pictures in the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex while AA homozygotes  displayed a signal decrease. Since groups did not differ on skin conductance level  and behavioral parameters, this effect in the risk group in line with results from  fMRI studies is speculated to represent an adaptive mechanism to compensate for  presumably increased subcortical activity driven by an overactive NPS system.  However, anxiety sensitivity correlated negatively with prefrontal activity in T  allele carriers possibly suggesting a decompensation of the adaptive compensatory  upregulation.","2015-12","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1730-1737","","12","10","","Soc Cogn Affect Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author (2015).

However, up to date little is known regarding  menstrual cycle (MC) effects on brain activation and connectivity patterns during  verbal WM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal dataset to  study dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, putamen and caudate activation and  connectivity patterns during a verbal WM task along the natural MC. Thirty-nine  naturally cycling healthy women were scanned three times locked to their MC (menses,  pre-ovulatory and luteal phase). They performed an N-back task with two trial types,  targets and lures, assessing (i) updating and (ii) inhibitory process respectively.  Distinct patterns of fronto-striatal activation and connectivity changes were  observed for each process. (i) For targets, we observed decreased connectivity  between left striatum- and inferior frontal and parietal areas, the circuit  underlying phonological WM, in response to elevated progesterone during the luteal  phase. Simultaneously, we observed an alleviation of inhibition from fronto-striatal  areas on areas related to higher cognitive effort and the salience network. (ii) For  lures, negative inter-hemispheric connectivity between fronto-parietal areas during  the pre-ovulatory phase, as well as increased connectivity between bilateral  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posteromedial structures during the luteal phase.  Overall, we corroborated a hormone mediated inter-hemispheric decoupling, enhanced  frontal activity and disinhibition of the salience brain network and striatum during  the luteal phase. In summary, we interpret these results in relation to a  differential top-down regulation in higher hormone levels phases and hyperactive  bottom-up network during the luteal phase, which could explain the vulnerability of  this phase to MC associated disorders.","2021-03","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","105108","","","125","","Psychoneuroendocrinology","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

However,  little is known about how exposure to cannabis cues and contexts may influence  cognitive control and the underlying neural mechanisms in cannabis users.  OBJECTIVES: Working memory (WM) is an attention reliant executive function central  to cognitive control. In this study, we investigated how distracting cannabis words  affected WM load-dependent performance and related brain activity in near-daily  cannabis users (N = 36) relative to controls (N = 33). METHODS: Brain activity was  recorded during a novel N-back flanker WM task with neutral and cannabis flankers  added as task-irrelevant distractors. RESULTS: On a behavioural level, WM  performance did not differ between groups, and the presence of cannabis flankers did  not affect performance. However, in cannabis users compared to controls, the  presence of cannabis flankers reduced WM load-related activity in multiple regions,  including the insula, thalamus, superior parietal lobe and supramarginal gyrus.  CONCLUSIONS: The group specificity of these effects suggest that cannabis users  might differ from controls in the way they process cannabis-related cues and that  cannabis cue exposure could interfere with other cognitive processes under  cognitively demanding circumstances. Future studies should focus on the role of  context in cognitive control-related processes like WM and attention to further  elucidate potential cognitive impairments in heavy cannabis users and how these  relate to loss of control over drug seeking itself.","2021-08-27","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","","","","","","Psychopharmacology (Berl)","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021.

Older subjects performed as well as the younger subjects at 1-Back (p=0.4), but  performed worse than the younger subjects at 2-Back (p<0.01) and 3-Back (p=0.06).  Older subjects had significantly longer reaction time (RT) than younger subjects  (p<0.04) at all levels of task difficulty. Image analysis using SPM 99 revealed a  similar distribution of cortical activity between younger and older subjects at all  task levels. However, an analysis of variance revealed a significant group x task  interaction in the prefrontal cortex bilaterally; within working memory capacity, as  in 1-Back when the older subjects performed as well as the younger subjects, they  showed greater prefrontal cortical (BA 9) activity bilaterally. At higher working  memory loads, however, when they performed worse then the younger subjects, the  older subjects showed relatively reduced activity in these prefrontal regions. These  data suggest that, within capacity, compensatory mechanisms such as additional  prefrontal cortical activity are called upon to maintain proficiency in task  performance. As cognitive demand increases, however, they are pushed past a  threshold beyond which physiological compensation cannot be made and, a decline in  performance occurs.","2006-01-09","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","32-37","","1-2","392","","Neurosci Lett","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Ireland PMID: 16213083","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Aged; Middle Aged; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Aging/*physiology; Reaction Time/physiology; Neuropsychological Tests/statistics & numerical data; Age Factors; Prefrontal Cortex/blood supply/*physiology; Carbamide Peroxide; Drug Combinations; Peroxides/blood; Urea/analogs & derivatives/blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to  examine brain activity in youth at varying stages of risk for SMI using functional  magnetic resonance imaging tasks (fMRI) that engage brain systems believed to be  affected. METHODS: Two hundred and forty three participants at different stages of  risk for SMI were recruited to the Canadian Psychiatric Risk and Outcome (PROCAN)  study, however only 179 were scanned. Stages included asymptomatic participants at  no elevated risk, asymptomatic participants at elevated risk due to family history,  participants with undifferentiated general symptoms of mental illness, and those  experiencing attenuated versions of diagnosable psychiatric illnesses. The fMRI  tasks included: (1) a monetary incentive delay task; (2) an emotional Go-NoGo and  (3) an n-back working memory task. RESULTS: Strong main effects with each of the  tasks were found in brain regions previously described in the literature. However,  there were no significant differences in brain activity between any of the stages of  risk for SMI for any of the task contrasts, after accounting for site, sex and age.  Furthermore, results indicated no significant differences even when participants  were dichotomized as asymptomatic or symptomatic.

To date, it  remains unknown how these distributed regions are systemically organized at the  connectome level and how the disruption of such organization brings about the WM  impairment seen in schizophrenia. METHODS: We used graph theory to examine the  neural efficiency of the functional connectome in different granularity in 155  patients with schizophrenia and 96 healthy controls during a WM task. These analyses  were repeated in another independent dataset (81 patients and 54 controls). Linear  regression analysis was used to test associations of altered graph properties,  clinical symptoms, and WM accuracy in patients. A machine-learning approach was  adopted to study the ability of multivariate connectome features from one dataset to  discriminate patients from controls in the second dataset. RESULTS: Small-worldness  of the whole-brain connectome was significantly increased in schizophrenia during  the WM task; this increase is related to better (though subpar) WM accuracy in  patients with more severe negative symptom burden. There was a shift in the degree  distribution to a more homogeneous form in patients. The machine-learning approach  classified a new set of patients from controls with 84.3% true-positivity rate for  schizophrenia and 71.6% overall accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a putative  mechanistic link between connectome topology, hub redistribution, and impaired  n-back performance in schizophrenia. The task-dependent modulation of the connectome  relates to, but remains inefficient in, improving the performance above par in the  presence of severe negative symptoms.","2020-07-08","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","916-926","","4","46","","Schizophr Bull","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2020.

However, patients exhibited a significantly decreased activation in the dorsal  anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in association with increasing task demands. While  dACC activation in controls showed a linear increase with increasing task demands,  this linearity was not detectable in patients with OCD.

Interpreting abstract  speech and integrating nonverbal modalities is particularly affected. Considering  the impact of communication on social life but failure to treat communication  dysfunctions with usual treatment, we will investigate the possibility to improve  verbal and non-verbal communication in schizophrenia by applying a multimodal  speech-gesture training (MSG training). Here we describe the newly developed MSG  training program and the study design for the first clinical investigation. The  intervention contains perceptive rating (match/mismatch of sentence and gesture) and  memory tasks (n-back tasks), imitation and productive tasks (e.g., SG  fluency-similar to verbal fluency where words are accompanied by gesture). In  addition, we offer information about gesture as meta-learning element as well as  homework for reasons of transfer to everyday life as part of every session. In the  MSG training intervention, we offer eight sessions (60 min each) of training. The  first pilot study is currently conducted as a single-center, randomized controlled  trial of speech-gesture intervention versus wait-list control with a follow-up.  Outcomes are measured through pre-post-fMRI and standardized psychological  questionnaires comparing two subject groups (30 patients with schizophrenia and 30  healthy controls). Patients and healthy controls are randomized in two intervention  groups (with 20 being in the wait-training group and 10 in the training-follow-up  group).

In this trial, for the first time, we test the  proof-of-concept of whether the acute and training effects of aerobic exercise on  working memory and brain network connectivity are related in the same participants.  METHODS: Cognitively normal older participants (N = 34) were enrolled in a  randomized clinical trial (NCT02453178). Participants completed fMRI resting state  and a face working memory N-back task acutely after light- and moderate-intensity  exercises and after a 12-wk aerobic training intervention. RESULTS: Functional  connectivity did not change more after moderate-intensity training compared with  light-intensity training. However, both training groups showed similar changes in  cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) (maximal exercise oxygen uptake, V˙O2peak), limiting  group-level comparisons. Acute effects of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on  connections primarily in the default network predicted training enhancements in the  same connections. Working memory also improved acutely, especially after  moderate-intensity, and greater acute improvements predicted greater working memory  improvement with training. Exercise effects on functional connectivity of right  lateralized frontoparietal connections were related to both acute and training gains  in working memory. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the concept of acute aerobic  exercise effects on functional brain systems and performance as an activity-evoked  biomarker for exercise training benefits in the same outcomes. These findings may  lead to new insights and methods for improving memory outcomes with aerobic exercise  training.","2020-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","131-140","","1","52","","Med Sci Sports Exerc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31385912  PMCID: PMC7753185","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\UMKMVYHB\Voss et al. - 2020 - Acute Exercise Effects Predict Training Change in .pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Middle Aged; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Cognition/*physiology; Brain/diagnostic imaging/*physiology; Exercise/*physiology; Cardiorespiratory Fitness; Physical Conditioning, Human/*physiology; Proof of Concept Study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Neuroimaging was  analyzed in 29 individuals with ASD without intellectual disability who had  clinically significant EF impairment on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive  Function, and 20 typically developing controls (participant age range=16-34). An SWM  N-Back task was performed during fMRI. SWM activity (2-Back vs. 0-Back) and  task-related dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) connectivity was examined within  and between groups. Variability of neural response during SWM was also examined.  RESULTS: During SWM performance both groups activated the expected networks, and no  group differences in network activation or task-related DLPFC-connectivity were  found. However, greater individual variability in the pattern of SWM activity was  found in the ASD versus the typically developing control group. CONCLUSIONS: While  there were no group differences in SWM task-evoked activity or connectivity,  fronto-parietal network engagement was found to be more variable/idiosyncratic in  ASD.

We found that 9/10 heterozygotes, who  are believed to have higher striatal DA signaling, demonstrated stronger  connectivity between dorsal caudate (DC) and insular, dorsal anterior cingulate, and  dorsolateral prefrontal regions, as well as between ventral striatum and  ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, than 10/10 homozygotes. Across subjects, stronger  DC-seeded connectivity predicted superior N-back working memory performance, while  stronger ventral striatum-seeded connectivity predicted reduced impulsivity in  everyday life. Further, mediation analysis suggested that connectivity strength  mediated relationships between DAT1 genotype and behavior.

In this study, we analyzed data of over 1,000 children from  the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study to examine whether  monolinguals and multilinguals differ in executive function, functional brain  connectivity, and brain-behavior associations. We observed significantly better  performance from multilingual children than monolinguals in working-memory tasks. In  one finding, we were able to classify multilinguals from monolinguals using only  their whole-brain functional connectome at rest and during an emotional n-back task.  Compared to monolinguals, the multilingual group had different functional  connectivity mainly in the occipital lobe and subcortical areas during the emotional  n-back task and in the occipital lobe and prefrontal cortex at rest. In contrast, we  did not find any differences in behavioral performance and functional connectivity  when performing a stop-signal task. As a second finding, we investigated the degree  to which behavior is reflected in the brain by implementing a connectome-based  behavior prediction approach. The multilingual group showed a significant  correlation between observed and connectome-predicted individual working-memory  performance scores, while the monolingual group did not show any correlations.  Overall, our observations suggest that multilingualism enhances executive function  and reliably modulates the corresponding brain functional connectome, distinguishing  multilinguals from monolinguals even at the developmental stage.","2021-12-07","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","","","49","118","","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 34845019  PMCID: PMC8670526","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\QKQ37TIC\Kwon et al. - 2021 - Predicting multilingual effects on executive funct.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Child; Adolescent; Brain/physiology; Cognition/physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain Mapping/methods; *fMRI; *functional connectivity; *working memory; Memory, Short-Term; Executive Function/*physiology; Connectome/*methods; *children; Prefrontal Cortex; *multilingualism; *Multilingualism; Forecasting/methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Working memory performance likely reflects  a balance between corticostriatal dysfunction and compensatory mechanisms. We tested  this hypothesis by examining working memory performance with a letter n-back task in  19 patients with mild-moderate Parkinson's disease and 20 demographically matched  healthy controls. Parkinson's disease patients were tested after an overnight  washout of their usual dopamine replacement therapy, and again after a standard dose  of levodopa. FMRI was used to assess task-related activation and resting state  functional connectivity; changes in BOLD signal were related to performance to  disentangle pathological and compensatory processes. Parkinson's disease patients  off dopamine replacement therapy displayed significantly reduced spatial extent of  task-related activation in left prefrontal and bilateral parietal cortex, and poorer  working memory performance, compared to controls. Amongst the Parkinson's disease  patients off dopamine replacement therapy, relatively better performance was  associated with greater activation of right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared  to controls, consistent with compensatory right hemisphere recruitment.  Administration of levodopa remediated the working memory deficit in the Parkinson's  disease group, and resulted in a different pattern of performance-correlated  activity, with a shift to greater left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activation in  patients on, compared to off dopamine replacement therapy. Levodopa also  significantly increased resting-state functional connectivity between caudate and  right parietal cortex (within the right fronto-parietal attentional network). The  strength of this connectivity contributed to better performance in patients and  controls, suggesting a general compensatory mechanism. These findings argue that  Parkinson's disease patients can recruit additional neural resources, here, the  right fronto-parietal network, to optimize working memory performance despite  impaired corticostriatal function. Levodopa seems to both boost engagement of a  task-specific prefrontal region, and strengthen a putative compensatory  caudate-cortical network to support this executive function.","2017-08","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","193-205","","","93","","Cortex","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

These results suggest that FEP and HC  or FEP and ARMS cannot be accurately separated in small samples under these  conditions. However, ARMS can be identified with very high sensitivity in comparison  to HC.

The current study  was designed to quantify functional alterations to the fronto-striatal circuit in  children with prenatal MA exposure using functional magnetic resonance imaging  (fMRI). Because many women who use MA during pregnancy also use alcohol, a known  teratogen, we examined 50 children (age range 7-15), 19 with prenatal MA exposure,  15 of whom had concomitant prenatal alcohol exposure (the MAA group), 13 with heavy  prenatal alcohol but no MA exposure (ALC group), and 18 unexposed controls (CON  group). We hypothesized that MA exposed children would demonstrate abnormal brain  activation during a visuospatial working memory (WM) ""N-Back"" task. As predicted,  the MAA group showed less activation than the CON group in many brain areas,  including the striatum and frontal lobe in the left hemisphere. The ALC group showed  less activation than the MAA group in several regions, including the right striatum.  We found an inverse correlation between performance and activity in the striatum in  both the CON and MAA groups. However, this relationship was significant in the  caudate of the CON group but not the MAA group, and in the putamen of the MAA group  but not the CON group. These findings suggest that structural damage in the  fronto-striatal circuit after prenatal MA exposure leads to decreased recruitment of  this circuit during a WM challenge, and raise the possibility that a rewiring of  cortico-striatal networks may occur in children with prenatal MA exposure.","2011-02-14","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","3067-3075","","4","54","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Recovery is variable and  deficits in executive function, e.g., working memory (WM) can persist years  post-mTBI. We tested whether cognitive deficits persist in otherwise healthy  undergraduates, as a conservative indicator for mTBI survivors at large. We  collected WM performance (change detection, n-back tasks) using various stimuli  (shapes, locations, letters; aurally presented numbers and letters), and  wide-ranging cognitive assessments (e.g., RBANS). We replicated the observation of a  general visual WM deficit, with preserved auditory WM. Surprisingly, visual WM  deficits were equivalent in participants with a history of mTBI (mean 4.3 years  post-injury) and in undergraduates with recent sports-related mTBI (mean 17 days  post-injury). In seeking the underlying mechanism of these behavioral deficits, we  collected resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) and EEG (rsEEG). RsfMRI revealed significantly  reduced connectivity within WM-relevant networks (default mode, central executive,  dorsal attention, salience), whereas rsEEG identified no differences (modularity,  global efficiency, local efficiency). In summary, otherwise healthy current  undergraduates with a history of mTBI present behavioral deficits with evidence of  persistent disconnection long after full recovery is expected.","2021-02-02","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","2789","","1","11","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 33531546  PMCID: PMC7854733","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\M6E5EIVF\Arciniega et al. - 2021 - Impaired visual working memory and reduced connect.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Young Adult; Memory, Short-Term; Memory Disorders/*etiology; Cognition Disorders/*etiology; Brain Concussion/*complications; Cognitive Dysfunction/*etiology; Students","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After controlling for differences in task performance  only differences in the DLPFC and cerebellum remained. Left DLPFC activation was  inversely correlated with Hamilton and MADRS scores. The patients showed failure to  de-activate in the medial prefrontal cortex, an area corresponding to the anterior  medial node of the default mode network.

Furthermore, studies in nonhuman primates (NHP) have suggested that  intermittent administration of low doses of D1R agonists produce long-lasting  reversals in cognitive deficits. The purpose of this trial was to test whether a  similar design, involving subacute intermittent administration of low doses of a  full, selective agonist at D1Rs, DAR-0100A, would improve cognitive deficits in SCZ.  METHODS: We randomized 49 clinically stable individuals with SCZ to three weeks of  intermittent treatment with 0.5 mg or 15 mg of DAR-0100A, or placebo (normal  saline). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) BOLD was used to evaluate the  effects of drug administration on brain activity during a working memory (WM) task.  Effects on cognition were also assessed using the MATRICS and the N-back task as  primary endpoints. The CogState battery was used as a secondary endpoint. RESULTS:  There were no observed treatment effects on either the BOLD fMRI signal during WM  tasks or the WM domains of the MATRICS. Moderate improvement was detected on the  CogState battery and on the attention domain of the MATRICS. CONCLUSION: These  results suggest that low doses of D1 agonists that do not result in measureable  occupancy of the D1R do not reliably improve cognition in SCZ, unlike the  observations in NHP. As this drug is limited by its pharmacokinetic profile, better  D1R agonists that can achieve adequate levels of D1R occupancy are needed to test  the efficacy of this mechanism for cognitive enhancement in SCZ.","2016-05","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","428-435","","5","30","","J Psychopharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2016.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 26966119","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\W2UUTULQ\Girgis et al. - 2016 - A proof-of-concept, randomized controlled trial of.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; *schizophrenia; Double-Blind Method; Memory, Short-Term/drug effects; Cognition/drug effects; Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use; *cognitive enhancement; *DAR-0100A; *dopamine-1 agonist; *randomized controlled trial; Attention/drug effects; Cerebral Cortex/drug effects/metabolism; Cognition Disorders/drug therapy/metabolism; Dopamine Agonists/*therapeutic use; Dopamine/*metabolism; Nootropic Agents/*therapeutic use; Phenanthridines/*therapeutic use; Receptors, Dopamine D1/*agonists; Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the longitudinal course of these  abnormalities, and how they relate to subsequent clinical and functional outcome is  relatively unclear. METHODS: A cohort of subjects at ultra high risk of psychosis  were studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in conjunction with  the N-Back task, and volumetric MRI at first clinical presentation and again after  one year. Levels of psychopathology and global functioning were assessed at the same  time points using the CAARMS, PANSS, and the GAF scale. RESULTS: At baseline, the  high risk group showed reduced activation during the task in the left middle frontal  gyrus, supramarginal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule, and reduced gray matter  volume in the left middle and medial frontal gyri, left insula and the right  anterior cingulate gyrus. Within the high-risk group, there was a positive  correlation between the magnitude of the functional and structural alterations in  the left middle frontal gyrus. Between presentation and follow up, the severity of  perceptual disorder and thought disorder (rated by the CAARMS), and of general  psychopathology (rated by the PANSS general score) decreased, and the level of  global functioning improved. This clinical and functional improvement was associated  with a longitudinal increase in activation in the anterior cingulate and right  parahippocampal gyrus. The change in anterior cingulate response was directly  correlated with the improvement in the GAF score. CONCLUSIONS: In subjects  presenting with prodromal signs of psychosis, reduced prefrontal activation during a  working memory task is associated with a reduction in gray matter volume in the same  area. Changes in anterior cingulate activation were correlated with functional  improvement in this group, consistent with the role of this region in multiple  cognitive and social processes.","2011-02","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","190-198","","2","45","","J Psychiatr Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

How these abnormalities relate to  different probabilities for later transition to psychosis is unclear. We  investigated vulnerability- versus disease-related versus resilience biomarkers of  psychosis during working memory (WM) processing in individuals with an at-risk  mental state (ARMS). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with ""first-episode psychosis""  (FEP, n = 21), short-term ARMS (ARMS-ST, n = 17), long-term ARMS (ARMS-LT, n = 16),  and healthy controls (HC, n = 20) were investigated with an n-back WM task. We  examined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and structural magnetic  resonance imaging (sMRI) data in conjunction using biological parametric mapping  (BPM) toolbox. PRINCIPAL OBSERVATIONS: There were no differences in accuracy, but  the FEP and the ARMS-ST group had longer reaction times compared with the HC and the  ARMS-LT group. With the 2-back > 0-back contrast, we found reduced functional  activation in ARMS-ST and FEP compared with the HC group in parietal and middle  frontal regions. Relative to ARMS-LT individuals, FEP patients showed decreased  activation in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and insula, and in the left  prefrontal cortex. Compared with the ARMS-LT, the ARMS-ST subjects showed reduced  activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus and insula. Reduced insular and  prefrontal activation was associated with gray matter volume reduction in the same  area in the ARMS-LT group. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that vulnerability to  psychosis was associated with neurofunctional alterations in fronto-temporo-parietal  networks in a WM task. Neurofunctional differences within the ARMS were related to  different duration of the prodromal state and resilience factors.","2012-10","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","2281-2294","","10","33","","Hum Brain Mapp","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","","","","PMID: 21922599  PMCID: PMC6870404","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\JFFTSNS5\Smieskova et al. - 2012 - Different duration of at-risk mental state associa.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Risk Factors; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Brain/*physiopathology; *Brain Mapping; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Nerve Net/*physiopathology; Psychotic Disorders/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Working  memory-related and long-term memory-related changes in this population are not well  understood. The objective of this study was to demonstrate that cancer-related  cognitive impairments are associated with the under recruitment of brain regions  involved in working and recognition memory compared with controls. METHODS: Oncology  patients (n = 15) who were receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and had evidence of  cognitive impairment according to neuropsychological testing and self-report and a  group of age-matched, education group-matched, cognitively normal control  participants (n = 14) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging. During  functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants performed a nonverbal n-back  working memory task and a visual recognition task. RESULTS: On the working memory  task, when 1-back and 2-back data were averaged and contrasted with 0-back data,  significantly reduced activation was observed in the right dorsolateral prefrontal  cortex for oncology patients versus controls. On the recognition task, oncology  patients displayed decreased activity of the left-middle hippocampus compared with  controls. Neuroimaging results were not associated with patient-reported cognition.  CONCLUSIONS: Decreased recruitment of brain regions associated with the encoding of  working memory and recognition memory was observed in the oncology patients compared  with the control group. These results suggest that there is a reduction in neural  functioning postchemotherapy and corroborate patient-reported cognitive difficulties  after cancer treatment, although a direct association was not observed.

To explore the  effects of this widely used agent on cognition and brain activation in early phases  of cognitive decline, we performed a double-blinded, placebo-controlled functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study during an n-back working memory task in 17  individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared to 17 age-matched healthy  controls (HC). All individuals were regular caffeine consumers with an overnight  abstinence and given 200 mg caffeine versus placebo tablets 30 minutes before  testing. Analyses included assessment of task-related activation (general linear  model), functional connectivity (tensorial-independent component analysis, TICA),  baseline perfusion (arterial spin labeling, ASL), grey matter density (voxel-based  morphometry, VBM), and white matter microstructure (tract-based spatial statistics,  TBSS). Acute caffeine administration induced a focal activation of the prefrontal  areas in HC with a more diffuse and posteromedial activation pattern in MCI  individuals. In MCI, TICA documented a significant caffeine-related enhancement in  the prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area, ventral premotor and parietal  cortex as well as the basal ganglia and cerebellum. The absence of significant group  differences in baseline ASL perfusion patterns supports a neuronal rather than a  purely vascular origin of these differences. The VBM and TBSS analyses excluded  potentially confounding differences in grey matter density and white matter  microstructure between MCI and HC. The present findings suggest a posterior  displacement of working memory-related brain activation patterns after caffeine  administration in MCI that may represent a compensatory mechanism to counterbalance  a frontal lobe dysfunction.","2014","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","101-112","","1","41","","J Alzheimers Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 24577471","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Aged; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Cross-Over Studies; Memory, Short-Term/*drug effects/physiology; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; functional magnetic resonance imaging; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; mild cognitive impairment; Reaction Time/drug effects; Blood oxygenation level dependent; Brain/drug effects/pathology/*physiopathology; caffeine; Caffeine/*pharmacology; Central Nervous System Stimulants/*pharmacology; Cerebrovascular Circulation/drug effects/physiology; Cognitive Dysfunction/*drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology; Gray Matter/drug effects/pathology/physiopathology; Neural Pathways/drug effects/pathology/physiopathology; White Matter/drug effects/pathology/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However,  little is known about de-activations associated with the disorder. This study aimed  to examine, at the whole-brain level, abnormal patterns of task-related activation  and de-activation during performance of a working memory task. METHODS: Twenty-nine  DSM-IV bipolar patients and 46 healthy controls underwent fMRI during performance of  the n-back task. The patients were scanned while they were in a manic episode.  Linear models were used to obtain maps of within-group activations and areas of  differential activation between the groups. RESULTS: The manic patients showed  reduced activation compared to the controls in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal  cortex and the right parietal cortex. They also showed failure of de-activation in  the medial frontal cortex, extending to the temporal poles and parts of the limbic  system bilaterally. The failure of activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  disappeared when differences in task performance were controlled for in the  analysis. However, the medial frontal failure of de-activation survived controlling  for this. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that, in addition to reduced prefrontal  activation, failure of de-activation is an important functional imaging abnormality  in mania. This, together with its location in the medial prefrontal cortex, implies  default mode network dysfunction in the disorder.","2012-12","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","616-626","","8","13","","World J Biol Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 21604958","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Neuropsychological Tests; Prefrontal Cortex/*physiopathology; Nerve Net/*physiopathology; Bipolar Disorder/*physiopathology; Discrimination, Psychological/physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/instrumentation/methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In humans, weekly Epo administration over 3 months improves cognitive  function in schizophrenia. The neural underpinnings and time-course of this effect  of Epo are currently unknown. It is also unclear whether the cognitive improvement  reflects direct neurobiological actions or is secondary to hematological effects. We  therefore assessed the actions of single administration of Epo (40,000 IU) vs.  saline to healthy volunteers on cognitive and neural measures of executive function  using a verbal fluency task and N-back working memory (WM) paradigm during  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on day 3 and 7 after administration in  two separate cohorts of subjects. Epo modulated neuronal response in a  fronto-parietal network during WM performance at both time points; on day 3 after  administration, activation was increased in left-hemisphere frontal and cingulate  cortex and reduced in the right parietal cortex; in contrast, neural response was  enhanced in a right-lateralized fronto-parietal network and reduced in left-side  regions 1 week post-administration. In addition, Epo-treated volunteers displayed  improved verbal fluency performance 1 week post-administration. These effects  occurred in the absence of changes in hematological measures suggesting that they  reflect direct neurobiological actions of Epo. The findings are consistent with  enduring effects of Epo on neurotrophic signaling and induction of neurochemical  changes over time in neural networks typically affected in neuropsychiatric illness.  The present study supports the notion that Epo may have clinical applications in the  treatment of psychiatric disorder characterized by cognitive dysfunction.","2008-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","313-321","","3","184","","Exp Brain Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 17828390","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\CYGVEJJF\Miskowiak et al. - 2008 - Differential effects of erythropoietin on neural a.pdf","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Cohort Studies; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Time; Memory, Short-Term/drug effects/physiology; Cognition/*drug effects/physiology; Cerebrovascular Circulation/drug effects/physiology; Cerebral Cortex/*drug effects/physiology; Erythropoietin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Frontal Lobe/drug effects/physiology; Gyrus Cinguli/drug effects/physiology; Nerve Growth Factors/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Nerve Net/drug effects/physiology; Nootropic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Parietal Lobe/drug effects/physiology; Thinking/*drug effects/physiology; Verbal Behavior/drug effects/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been reported to be high in flavonoids  and might potentially improve brain activity among older adults with mild cognitive  impairment (MCI). The effect of CC in brain activation improvement using  neuroimaging is yet to be discovered. PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of CC  supplement on brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)  among older adults with MCI. STUDY TYPE: Prospective, randomized, double-blind,  placebo-controlled trial. POPULATION/SUBJECTS: Twenty older adults with mild  cognitive impairment (60-75 years old), 14 of them (70%) were female subjects. FIELD  STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: A 3.0-T, T1-weighted anatomical images, T2*-weighted imaging  data, A single shot, gradient echo-echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence. ASSESSMENT:  All subjects were asked to consume two 500 mg capsules of either CC supplement or  placebo (maltodextrin) daily for 12 weeks. Cognitive function was measured using  validated neuropsychological tests (i.e. Mini-mental State Examination and Digit  Span) and task-based fMRI (N-back and Stroop Color Word Test) at baseline and 12th  week.

Cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging","","2451-9030 2451-9022","10.1016/j.bpsc.2020.10.018","","BACKGROUND: There is emerging evidence for abnormal beta oscillations in psychosis. Beta oscillations are likely to play a key role in the coordination of sensorimotor  information that is crucial to healthy mental function. Growing evidence suggests  that beta oscillations typically manifest as transient beta bursts that increase in  probability following a motor response, observable as post-movement beta rebound.  Evidence indicates that post-movement beta rebound is attenuated in psychosis, with  greater attenuation associated with greater symptom severity and impairment.  Delineating the functional role of beta bursts therefore may be key to understanding  the mechanisms underlying persistent psychotic illness. METHODS: We used concurrent  electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify blood  oxygen level-dependent correlates of beta bursts during the n-back working memory  task and intervening rest periods in healthy control participants (n = 30) and  patients with psychosis (n = 48). RESULTS: During both task blocks and intervening  rest periods, beta bursts phasically activated regions implicated in task-relevant  content while suppressing currently tonically active regions. Patients showed  attenuated post-movement beta rebound that was associated with persisting  disorganization symptoms as well as impairments in cognition and role function.  Patients also showed greater task-related reductions in overall beta burst rate and  showed greater, more extensive, beta burst-related blood oxygen level-dependent  activation. CONCLUSIONS: Our evidence supports a model in which beta bursts  reactivate latently maintained sensorimotor information and are dysregulated and  inefficient in psychosis. We propose that abnormalities in the mechanisms by which  beta bursts coordinate reactivation of contextually appropriate content can manifest  as disorganization, working memory deficits, and inaccurate forward models and may  underlie a core deficit associated with persisting symptoms and impairment.","2021-12","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","1145-1156","","12","6","","Biol Psychiatry Cogn Neurosci Neuroimaging","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

Patients with HIV commonly have deficits  in working memory and attention, which may negatively impact many other cognitive  domains, leading to HAND. Since HAND may lead to loss of independence in activities  of daily living and negative emotional well-being, and incur a high economic burden,  effective treatments for HAND are urgently needed. This study aims to determine  whether adaptive working memory training might improve cognitive functions and  neural network efficiency and possibly decrease neuroinflammation. This study also  aims to assess whether subjects with the LMX1A-rs4657412 TT(AA) genotype show  greater training effects from working memory training than TC(AG) or  CC(GG)-carriers. METHODS/DESIGN: 60 HIV-infected and 60 seronegative control  participants will be randomized to a double-blind active-controlled study, using  adaptive versus non-adaptive Cogmed Working Memory Training® (CWMT), 20-25 sessions  over 5-8 weeks. Each subject will be assessed with near- and far-transfer cognitive  tasks, self-reported mood and executive function questionnaires, and  blood-oxygenation level-dependent functional MRI during working memory (n-back) and  visual attention (ball tracking) tasks, at baseline, 1-month, and 6-months after  CWMT. Furthermore, genotyping for LMX1A-rs4657412 will be performed to identify  whether subjects with the TT(AA)-genotype show greater gain or neural efficiency  after CWMT than those with other genotypes. Lastly, cerebrospinal fluid will be  obtained before and after CWMT to explore changes in levels of inflammatory proteins  (cytokines and chemokines) and monoamines. DISCUSSION: Improving working memory in  HIV patients, using CWMT, might slow the progression or delay the onset of HAND.  Observation of decreased brain activation or normalized neural networks, using fMRI,  after CWMT would lead to a better understanding of how neural networks are modulated  by CWMT. Moreover, validating the greater training gain in subjects with the  LMX1A-TT(AA) genotype could lead to a personalized approach for future working  memory training studies. Demonstrating and understanding the neural correlates of  the efficacy of CWMT in HIV patients could lead to a safe adjunctive therapy for  HAND, and possibly other brain disorders.

This  study aimed to assess the clinically variable ChEI treatment effects in a group of  patients with mild AD using a semantic association and an N-back light working  memory activation paradigm. Twenty-six patients with probable mild AD treated with a  ChEI for 20 weeks were retrospectively divided into responders and non-responders.  Patients were classified as responders if their Clinician's Interview Based  Impression of Change (CIBIC - Plus) score was four or less and if they had an  increase of at least two points on the MMSE. These criteria resulted in two  subgroups comprising nine responders and seventeen non responders. Nine healthy  elderly age-matched controls were also recruited as a comparison group. ChEI  treatment was accompanied by significant modulation of task induced activation  increases in both fMRI tasks in AD responders. The effect of ChEI response was in  effect a restoration of regional brain function in the same areas used by elderly  controls when performing these tasks. In non-responders decrements in task related  activation were observed and over time activation patterns appeared less like the  elderly controls. Screening semantic fluency scores correlated negatively with  activation increases at retest. In the paper, a tentative explanation is offered of  why subgroups of patients with a similar clinical diagnosis and level of clinical  severity show a different physiological response to ChE inhibition.","2009-04","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","97-111","","2","6","","Curr Alzheimer Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United Arab Emirates PMID: 19355844","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Retrospective Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Oxygen/blood; Case-Control Studies; Analysis of Variance; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods; Reproducibility of Results; Functional Laterality; Memory, Short-Term/drug effects; Reaction Time/drug effects; Alzheimer Disease/*drug therapy/*pathology; Association Learning/drug effects; Cerebral Cortex/blood supply/*drug effects; Cholinesterase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Semantics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHOD: This was a six-week, double-blind, randomized trial of risperidone  plus placebo versus divalproex plus placebo for patients with mania (n = 21; 13.6 ±  2.5 years of age). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) outcomes were  measured using a block design, affective, N-back task with angry, happy, and neutral  face stimuli at baseline and at 6-week follow-up. Matched healthy controls (HC; n =  15, 14.5 ± 2.8 years) were also scanned twice. RESULTS: In post hoc analyses on the  significant interaction in a 3×2×2 analysis of variance (ANOVA) that included  patient groups and HC, the risperidone group showed greater activation after  treatment in response to the angry face condition in the left subgenual anterior  cingulate cortex (ACC) and striatum relative to the divalproex group. The divalproex  group showed greater activation relative to the risperidone group in the left  inferior frontal gyrus and right middle temporal gyrus. Over the treatment course,  the risperidone group showed greater change in activation in the left ventral  striatum than the divalproex group, and the divalproex group showed greater  activation change in left inferior frontal gyrus and right middle temporal gyrus  than the risperidone group. Furthermore, each patient group showed increased  activation relative to HC in fronto-striato-temporal regions over time. The happy  face condition was potentially less emotionally challenging in this study and did  not elicit notable findings. CONCLUSIONS: When patients performed a working memory  task under emotional duress inherent in the paradigm, divalproex enhanced activation  in a fronto-temporal circuit whereas risperidone increased activation in the  dopamine (D₂) receptor-rich ventral striatum.

Clinical","","2213-1582","10.1016/j.nicl.2013.11.002","","This proof-of-concept study examines the feasibility of defining subgroups in psychiatric spectrum disorders by generative embedding, using dynamical system  models which infer neuronal circuit mechanisms from neuroimaging data. To this end,  we re-analysed an fMRI dataset of 41 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 42  healthy controls performing a numerical n-back working-memory task. In our  generative-embedding approach, we used parameter estimates from a dynamic causal  model (DCM) of a visual-parietal-prefrontal network to define a model-based feature  space for the subsequent application of supervised and unsupervised learning  techniques. First, using a linear support vector machine for classification, we were  able to predict individual diagnostic labels significantly more accurately (78%)  from DCM-based effective connectivity estimates than from functional connectivity  between (62%) or local activity within the same regions (55%). Second, an  unsupervised approach based on variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture modelling  provided evidence for two clusters which mapped onto patients and controls with  nearly the same accuracy (71%) as the supervised approach. Finally, when restricting  the analysis only to the patients, Gaussian mixture modelling suggested the  existence of three patient subgroups, each of which was characterised by a different  architecture of the visual-parietal-prefrontal working-memory network. Critically,  even though this analysis did not have access to information about the patients'  clinical symptoms, the three neurophysiologically defined subgroups mapped onto  three clinically distinct subgroups, distinguished by significant differences in  negative symptom severity, as assessed on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale  (PANSS). In summary, this study provides a concrete example of how psychiatric  spectrum diseases may be split into subgroups that are defined in terms of  neurophysiological mechanisms specified by a generative model of network dynamics  such as DCM. The results corroborate our previous findings in stroke patients that  generative embedding, compared to analyses of more conventional measures such as  functional connectivity or regional activity, can significantly enhance both the  interpretability and performance of computational approaches to clinical  classification.","2014","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","98-111","","","4","","Neuroimage Clin","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 24363992  PMCID: PMC3863808","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\5B83FNLP\Brodersen et al. - 2014 - Dissecting psychiatric spectrum disorders by gener.pdf","","Humans; Models, Statistical; Case-Control Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Schizophrenia; Brain/blood supply/*pathology; Neural Pathways/blood supply/pathology; Nonlinear Dynamics; Balanced purity; Clinical validation; Clustering; Nerve Net/blood supply/*pathology; Schizophrenia/*diagnosis; Variational Bayes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In network research in fMRI,  functional connectivity is considered as a set of pair-wise interactions between the  nodes of the network. These interactions are typically operationalized through the  full or partial correlation between all pairs of regional time series. Estimating  the structure of the latent underlying functional connectome from the set of  pair-wise partial correlations remains an open research problem though. Typically,  this thresholding problem is approached by proportional thresholding, or by means of  parametric or non-parametric permutation testing across a cohort of subjects at each  possible connection. As an alternative, we propose a data-driven thresholding  approach for network matrices on the basis of mixture modeling. This approach allows  for creating subject-specific sparse connectomes by modeling the full set of partial  correlations as a mixture of low correlation values associated with weak or  unreliable edges in the connectome and a sparse set of reliable connections.  Consequently, we propose to use alternative thresholding strategy based on the model  fit using pseudo-False Discovery Rates derived on the basis of the empirical null  estimated as part of the mixture distribution. We evaluate the method on synthetic  benchmark fMRI datasets where the underlying network structure is known, and  demonstrate that it gives improved performance with respect to the alternative  methods for thresholding connectomes, given the canonical thresholding levels. We  also demonstrate that mixture modeling gives highly reproducible results when  applied to the functional connectomes of the visual system derived from the n-back  Working Memory task in the Human Connectome Project. The sparse connectomes obtained  from mixture modeling are further discussed in the light of the previous knowledge  of the functional architecture of the visual system in humans. We also demonstrate  that with use of our method, we are able to extract similar information on the group  level as can be achieved with permutation testing even though these two methods are  not equivalent. We demonstrate that with both of these methods, we obtain functional  decoupling between the two hemispheres in the higher order areas of the visual  cortex during visual stimulation as compared to the resting state, which is in line  with previous studies suggesting lateralization in the visual processing. However,  as opposed to permutation testing, our approach does not require inference at the  cohort level and can be used for creating sparse connectomes at the level of a  single subject.","2018-05-01","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","402-414","","","171","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

In a randomized, placebo-controlled,  double-blind, parallel-group design, we investigated the neural correlates of  cognitive effects of rivastigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, given as an  add-on therapy to antipsychotic-treated schizophrenia patients. Thirty-six chronic  schizophrenia patients with mild cognitive impairment took part. After 1 week on  placebo (baseline), all patients entered a double-blind protocol; 18 were allocated  to receive rivastigmine and 18 placebo for the next 12 weeks (final sample with  usable imaging data: 11 patients on rivastigmine, 10 on placebo). All patients  underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during a parametric 'n-back' task,  involving monitoring of dots in particular locations on a screen at a given delay  from the original occurrence, twice: at baseline and 12 weeks  post-rivastigmine/placebo treatment. Compared to placebo, rivastigmine produced only  a small and non-significant improvement in task accuracy across all conditions with  no change in response latency, and increased activity in the extrastriate visual  cortex in areas associated with visual and spatial attention but not in any region  within the working memory network. Our observations suggest that cholinergic  enhancement with rivastigmine at doses known to be effective in Alzheimer's disease  does not produce strong and clinically meaningful cognitive and neural changes in  schizophrenia patients treated with atypical antipsychotics although the neural  effects in terms of enhanced neuronal activity in regions associated with visual and  spatial attention are consistent with those reported previously with cholinergic  enhancement in healthy subjects.","2006-01-15","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","545-556","","2","29","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16181792","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Drug Therapy, Combination; Reaction Time/physiology; Double-Blind Method; Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Brain/pathology; Cerebral Cortex/pathology; Neuroprotective Agents/*therapeutic use; Phenylcarbamates/*therapeutic use; Rivastigmine; Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/*pathology; Smoking/pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sex  differences in executive function in youth have been linked to vulnerability to  psychopathology as well as to behaviors that impinge on health, wellbeing, and  longevity. Yet, the neurobiological basis of these differences is not well  understood, in part due to the spatiotemporal complexity inherent in patterns of  brain network maturation supporting executive function. Here we test the hypothesis  that sex differences in impulsivity in youth stem from sex differences in the  controllability of structural brain networks as they rewire over development.  Combining methods from network neuroscience and network control theory, we  characterize the network control properties of structural brain networks estimated  from diffusion imaging data acquired in males and females in a sample of 879 youth  aged 8-22 years. We summarize the control properties of these networks by estimating  average and modal controllability, two statistics that probe the ease with which  brain areas can drive the network towards easy versus difficult-to-reach states. We  find that females have higher modal controllability in frontal, parietal, and  subcortical regions while males have higher average controllability in frontal and  subcortical regions. Furthermore, controllability profiles in males are negatively  related to the false positive rate on a continuous performance task, a common  measure of impulsivity. Finally, we find associations between average  controllability and individual differences in activation during an n-back working  memory task. Taken together, our findings support the notion that sex differences in  the controllability of structural brain networks can partially explain sex  differences in executive function. Controllability of structural brain networks also  predicts features of task-relevant activation, suggesting the potential for  controllability to represent context-specific constraints on network state more  generally.","2019-03","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","122-134","","","188","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

We investigate the effect of  active and sham Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) treatment on working  memory function of patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) considering  Task Positive and Default Mode networks (TPN and DMN). METHODS: An experiment with 4  levels of visuospatial n-back task was used to investigate the pattern of cortical  activation in 17 men with moderate or severe OSAS before and after 2 months of  therapeutic (active) or sub-therapeutic (sham) CPAP treatment. RESULTS: Patients  with untreated OSAS had significantly less deactivation in the temporal regions of  the DMN as compared to healthy controls, but activation within TPN regions was  comparatively relatively preserved. After 2 months of treatment, active and sham  CPAP groups exhibited opposite trends of cerebral activation and deactivation. After  treatment, the active CPAP group demonstrated an increase of cerebral activation in  the TPN at all task levels and of task-related cerebral deactivation in the anterior  midline and medial temporal regions of the DMN at the 3-back level, associated with  a significant improvement of behavioral performance, whereas the sham CPAP group  exhibited less deactivation in the temporal regions of Default Mode Network and less  Task Positive Network activation associated to longer response times at the 3-back.  CONCLUSION: OSAS has a significant negative impact primarily on task-related DMN  deactivation, particularly in the medial temporal regions, possibly due to nocturnal  hypoxemia, as well as TPN activation, particularly in the right ventral  fronto-parietal network. After 2 months of active nasal CPAP treatment a positive  response was noted in both TPN and DMN but without compete recovery of existing  behavioral and neuronal deficits. Initiation of CPAP treatment early in the course  of the disease may prevent or slow down the occurrence of irreversible impairment.","2012","2022-03-04 19:25:11","2022-03-04 19:25:11","","e47433","","12","7","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 23227139  PMCID: PMC3515559","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\7XGH9BI2\Prilipko et al. - 2012 - The effects of CPAP treatment on task positive and.pdf","","Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Double-Blind Method; Polysomnography; *Continuous Positive Airway Pressure; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We identified three  neurocognitive subtypes in the depressed group. Subtype 1 was high-performing (high  accuracy, moderate speed), Subtype 2 was cognitively impaired (low accuracy, slow  speed), and Subtype 3 was impulsive (low accuracy, fast speed). While subtypes did  not differ in clinical psychopathology, they diverged in their activation profiles  in regions critical for executive function, which mirrored differences in cognition.

This multicentre, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study  aimed to investigate the effect of 6 months P.minor extract supplement (Biokesum®)  on cognition, mood, biomarkers, and brain activation among older adults with Mild  Cognitive Impairment (MCI). METHOD: A total of 36 Malaysian community-dwelling older  adults with MCI (60-75-year-old) were randomized into Biokesum® (n = 18) and placebo  group (n = 18). Each subject consumed one capsule of Biokesum® (250 mg/capsule) or  placebo (maltodextrin, 280 mg/capsule) twice daily for 6 months. Cognitive function  and mood were assessed at baseline, 3rd, and 6th-month using neuropsychological  tests (MMSE, Digit Span, RAVLT, Digit Symbol, and Visual Reproduction) and Profile  of Mood State (POMS) questionnaire. Blood lipid profile, fasting blood glucose, and  biomarkers (MDA, LPO, COX-2, iNOS, and BDNF) were measured at baseline and 6th  month.

RESULTS: Two-way mixed ANOVA analysis showed  significant improvements in Visual Reproduction II (p = 0.012, partial  η(2) = 0.470), tension (p = 0.042, partial η(2) = 0.147), anger (p = 0.010, partial  η(2) = 0.207), confusion (p = 0.041, partial η(2) = 0.148), total negative subscales  (p = 0.043, partial η(2) = 0.145), BDNF (p = 0.020, partial η(2) = 0.179) and  triglyceride (p = 0.029, partial η(2) = 0.237) following 6 months of Biokesum®  supplementation. Preliminary finding also demonstrated significant improvement at  0-back task-induced right DLPFC activation (p = 0.028, partial η(2) = 0.652) among  subsamples in Biokesum® group. No adverse events were reported at the end of the  study. CONCLUSION: Six months Biokesum® supplementation potentially improved visual  memory, negative mood, BDNF, and triglyceride levels among older adults with MCI.  Significant findings on brain activation at the right DPLFC must be considered as  preliminary.
