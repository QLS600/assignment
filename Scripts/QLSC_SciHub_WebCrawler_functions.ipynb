Roisman and Marinus H. van IJzendoorn  N-back Working Memory Task: Meta-analysis of Normative fMRI Studies With Children  National Research University Higher School of Economics  Zachary Yaple  Marie Arsalidou  National Research University Higher School of Economics and York University  The n-back task is likely the most popular measure of working memory for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. Despite accumulating neuroimaging studies with the n-back task and children, its neural representation is still unclear. fMRI studies that used the n-back were compiled, and data from children up to 15 years (n = 260) were analyzed using activation likelihood estimation. Results show concordance in frontoparietal regions recognized for their role in working memory as well as regions not typically highlighted as part of the working memory network, such as the insula. Findings are discussed in terms of developmental methodology and potential contribution to developmental theories of cognition.  Working memory is the cognitive ability that enables one to mentally hold and manipulate information. Since its origin more than 50 years ago (Kirchner, 1958), the n-back task has been widely used to inves- tigate working memory processes. In a typical n-back paradigm, participants are presented with a sequence of stimuli and asked to report when a stimulus matches another stimulus trials back. Perfor- mance under varying degrees of working memory load (i.e., by varying the number of n) is determined by measuring reaction times and accuracy. Protocol parameters (e.g., stimuli types and targets) of n-back tasks allow for investigating working memory in var- ious domains behaviorally and with functional mag- netic resonance imaging (fMRI). For instance, in a verbal n-back task participants are instructed to report when a word or letter matches n times back (e.g., Stollstorff et al., 2010).

The purpose of this study is to determine overarching patterns on brain correlates of children performing the n-back task using quantitative, coordinate-based meta-analysis of fMRI studies. A literature search with key terms “fMRI” and “n- back” on web of science (webofknowledge.com) yields 518 articles, which speaks to the popularity of the task in functional neuroimaging research. There are many activation likelihood estimation (ALE; Eickhoff, Laird, Fox, Lancaster, & Fox, 2017; Turkel- taub, Eden, Jones, & Zefﬁro, 2002) meta-analyses examining different aspects of working memory in adults showing typical correlates (e.g., Owen, McMil- lan, Laird, & Bullmore, 2005; Rottschy et al., 2012) and atypical correlates (e.g., Kollndorfer et al., 2013). The ﬁrst meta-analyses that examined the n-back in adults identiﬁed a set of concordant regions that  © 2018 Society for Research in Child Development All rights reserved. 0009-3920/2018/xxxx-xxxx DOI: 10.1111/cdev.13080  \\\\x0c', '2  Yaple and Arsalidou  include the dorsal cingulate and premotor cortex (Brodmann area [BA] 32 and 6); medial posterior parietal and inferior parietal lobules (BA 7 and 40); and ventrolateral, dorsolateral, and frontopolar pre- frontal cortex (BA 46, 9, and 10; Owen et al., 2005). This set of areas, associated with working memory, has been subsequently replicated by other meta-ana- lyses with adults (e.g., Rottschy et al., 2012). fMRI meta-analyses with children are lacking. A recent meta-analysis examined concordance in working memory measures for typically developing adolescents (10–17 years) and young adults (18–30 years; Andre, Picchioni, Zhang, & Toulopoulou, 2015). ALE meta-analysis showed regions of increased concordance with age in the middle frontal gyrus (BA 6), middle frontal gyrus (BA 10), precuneus and infe- rior parietal gyrus (Andre et al., 2015). Critically, experiments (i.e., contrasts) used by Andre et al. (2015) followed a between-subject design with coordi- nates showing more activity for adults than children and adolescents; thus, results were conﬁrming those reported for within-group contrasts of adult studies (e.g., Owen et al., 2005). A meta-analysis of the reverse between-group contrasts that showed decrease activ- ity with age (i.e., reﬂecting more activity for children and adolescents compared with adults) showed con- cordance only in right superior frontal gyrus (BA 8) and left postcentral and parietal junction (BA 3 and 40; Andre et al., 2015). A serious methodological issue in these meta-analyses is the low number of studies included; n = 9 (foci = 60) and n = 6 (foci = 22) used to examine regions of increased and decreased brain activation with age, respectively (Andre et al., 2015). This low number of studies is not acceptable for ALE meta-analyses; a minimum of 17–20 studies is required for statistical evaluation of concordance across studies (Eickhoff et al., 2017). A less critical methodological drawback is the use of various differ- ent tasks (e.g., n-back, Sternberg and delayed match to sample), which may have confounded brain activation related to dissimilar underlying processes. Thus, due to methodological limitations, no clear conclusions can be drawn on children’s brain responses to the n- back from previous quantitative meta-analyses. Although the network supporting working mem- ory is well established in adults, the set of brain areas that sustain working memory processes in children and how it matures remains unclear. Many suggest that this may be, in part, due to the protracted matu- ration of the prefrontal cortex (e.g., Chai, Ofen, Gab- rieli, & Whitﬁeld-Gabrieli, 2014; Gogtay et al., 2004). In Table 1, we overview fMRI studies that examined brain responses to the n-back in typically developing children and focus on prefrontal activity. Notice, for  instance, that some studies report activity only within the right inferior and middle frontal gyri (Ciesielski et al., 2006; Massat et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2000; Thomas et al., 1999; Yu et al., 2011), whereas others show left inferior and middle frontal gyri (Diwadkar et al., 2013; Stollstorff et al., 2010). Despite lateralization and speciﬁcs, this qualitative summary suggests that prefrontal activity should be expected in children. Consistent with past ﬁndings on adults (Owen et al., 2005; Rottschy et al., 2012), most fMRI studies with children report frontal (i.e., BA 6) and parietal (i.e., BA 40 and 7) cortical activity related to the n-back (B\\\\x13edard et al., 2014; Beneventi, Tønnessen, Ersland, & Hugdahl, 2010b; Ciesielski et al., 2006; Grifﬁths et al., 2013; Malisza et al., 2005; Nelson et al., 2000; Yu et al., 2011). Developmental theories of cognition aim to explain the mechanisms that drive cognitive growth and in turn working memory development; how- ever, they vary to what causes this transition (e.g., Case, 1992; Demetriou, Christou, Spanoudis, & Plat- sidou, 2002; Demetriou, Spanoudis, & Shayer, 2014; Pascual-Leone, 1970; Pascual-Leone & Johnson, 2011). It is challenging to identify theories of cogni- tive development that clearly map brain constructs and mechanisms that drive cognitive growth. Some theories that attempt to link psychological constructs with brain development highlight the importance of the maturation of the frontal cortex as a source for cognitive growth that follows a set of stages (Case, 1992). Demetriou et al. (2014) also discuss the emer- gence of developmental cycles, which are mapped onto stages identiﬁed in electroencephalographic coherency patterns (e.g., Thatcher, 1992) that appear to follow a similar time frame. These patterns express alternations in left and right hemisphere electroen- cephalographic coherence as a function of age (Thatcher, 1992, 1997; Thatcher, North, & Biver, 2008). Stage-wise developmental patterns are also recognized by Pascual-Leone et al., who explain that right or left hemisphere dominance may be related to a trade-off between task demand and mental attentional capacity of the individual (Arsalidou, Pawliw-Levac, Sadeghi, & Pascual-Leone, in press; Pascual-Leone, 1987; Pascual-Leone & Johnson, 2005). More speciﬁcally, Pascual-Leone et al. propose a domain general theory, which explains cognitive development emerging from an interaction of opera- tors, schemes, and principles that have speciﬁc brain representation and reference to complex relations between cognition versus affect (e.g., Pascual-Leone & Johnson, 2005, for details). Core cognitive opera- tors are expressed in lateral frontal, parietal, tempo- ral, and occipital areas, where affective propensities  \\\\x0c', '(i.e., motivation) are expressed in brain areas such as the insula, amygdala, and anterior cingulate (e.g., Arsalidou & Pascual-Leone, 2016). Knowledge on brain areas associated with the n-back in children would provide new insights on core cognitive pro- cesses such as working memory. Speciﬁcally, the current study aims to provide a normative atlas, in stereotaxic space, of brain areas associated with the n-back task in children. Based on the existing literature, we hypothesize that a quantitative meta-analysis will reveal concordance in a set of distributed areas in parietal, frontal, and prefrontal regions. We examine brain responses to the n-back in participants who are 15 years or younger in a meta-analysis that maintain standards of sufﬁcient power (i.e., with 20 experiments or more: Eickhoff et al., 2017). For comparison, we also examine brain response to the n-back in adult participants; methodological information and results are presented in Supporting Information.  Method  Literature Search and Article Selection  The key terms: (a) n-back, children, and fMRI and (b) “working memory task,” children, and fMRI were searched (http://www.webofknowled ge.com) on April 4, 2017. Figure 1 shows the yield  of the searches and the steps taken to screen and identify eligible articles. Articles that used the n- back task with fMRI and reported whole-brain, ran- dom-effects results of within-group experiments (i.e., contrasts) in typically developing children were selected. Coordinates needed to be reported either in Talairach or Montreal Neurology Institute (MNI) coordinate space. Both authors selected experiments with contrast coordinates indepen- dently, and ﬁnal decisions were taken in agreement. The ﬁnal data set contained data from 17 eligible articles that reported fMRI coordinates on the n- back for typically developing children. Two articles reported results for two separate groups of children (Ciesielski et al., 2006; Stollstorff et al., 2010), and six articles reported more than one experiment (B\\\\x13edard et al., 2014; Beneventi, Tønnessen, Ersland, & Hugdahl, 2010a; Grifﬁths et al., 2013; Malisza et al., 2005; Vuontela et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2015); all of which were included in the analyses to improve power as the analyses algorithm accounts for within-group effects (Turkeltaub et al., 2012). A meta-analysis was performed using all n-back tasks with children 15 years and younger, which includes data from 29 experiments (from 17 articles; 260 participants). A minimum of 17–20 experiments is currently recommended to ensure the robustness of each cluster and sufﬁcient statistical power (Eick- hoff et al., 2016, 2017).

Given that most studies used a wide age range (e.g., 7–12 years), rather than discrete age ranges (e.g., 9–10 years), it was not possible to compare results between age groups (e.g., 12 years vs. 10 years). Table 2 includes demographic information for each article and exper- iments selected for each meta-analysis.  Software and Analysis  GingerALE is a freely available, quantitative meta- analysis method ﬁrst proposed by Turkeltaub et al. (2002) with the latest version descripted by Eickhoff et al. (2009, 2017) and Turkeltaub et al. (2012). Gin- gerALE, Version 2.3.6 (http://brainmap.org/ale/) was used, which relies on ALE (i.e., activation likeli- hood estimation). ALE compares coordinates (i.e., foci) compiled from multiple articles and computes for every voxel the probability that the voxel is acti- vated using the input foci. These probabilities are then  thresholded against a null distribution for signiﬁ- cance. By doing so, ALE estimates the magnitude of overlap between foci from multiple articles, yielding clusters most likely to become active. The most recent algorithm includes a correction to avoid summation of within-group effects and provides increased power by allowing for inclusion of all possible relevant experi- ments (Eickhoff et al., 2017; Turkeltaub et al., 2012). This algorithm allows for including multiple relevant contrasts per article and for organizing data by subject group. This is to ensure that subject groups with more contrasts do not inﬂuence the ALE maps more than subject groups with fewer contrasts. Although this algorithm reduces the total ALE values by 7%–9% com- pared with standard approaches, Turkeltaub et al. (2012) conclude that this method is theoretically advan- tageous and is set as the default algorithm in Ginger- ALE software.

Resulting statistical maps were thresholded using a cluster level correction for multiple compar- isons p = .05 at a cluster-forming threshold set at p < .001 (Eickhoff et al., 2017). Suprathreshold clusters were overlaid on an anatomical brain “colin_tlrc” (available via brainmap.org) using Analyses of Func- tional NeuroImages (Cox, 1996). Last, Fisher’s exact test was calculated to examine whether experiments were biased by task modality (i.e., verbal, digit, color, visu- ospatial, and categorical n-back tasks) and contrast type (2-back minus baseline, 1-back minus baseline, 0-back minus baseline).  Results  N-back tasks for children up to 15 years, with an average age of 10.61 \\\\x06 1.75 years, yielded a total of  283 foci (54.61% male; 95% right handed). Fisher’s exact test revealed no statistical signiﬁcance in fre- quency across task modality and contrast type (p = .863, Fisher’s exact test), indicating that the results were not biased toward a contrast type or task modality.  ALE Map  Seven clusters revealed signiﬁcant ALE scores. Activation likelihood is highest for the largest clus- ter found in the left superior frontal gyrus (BA 6), a cluster extending to dorsal parts of the cingulate gyrus (Table 3; Figure 2). The second and third lar- gest clusters of concordance are observed in parietal areas: right inferior parietal gyri (40) and bilateral superior parietal gyrus (BA 7). Signiﬁcant activation likelihood is also observed in the right insula, an  Table 2  Information on Source Data Sets Included in the Meta-analysis  Article  n  Gender  (M)  Handedness  (R)  Age range/M,  (SD)  Foci  Task modality  Contrast  B\\\\x13edard et al.

Precentral gyrus (BA 6) concordance is observed in a cluster that extends to the inferior frontal gyrus (BA 9). Other areas include the left cerebellar tonsil and uvula.  Discussion  We examine concordance in brain locations for chil- dren when solving the n-back. Posterior brain regions show concordance in children, consistent with previous ﬁndings for adults (e.g., Owen et al., 2005). This observation is also veriﬁed by a conjunc- tion analysis between adults and children (Table S3). However, concordance in anterior brain regions is inconsistent with adult data. We observe that pre- frontal regions (BA 46 and 10) are signiﬁcantly more concordant for adults compared with children (Table S3). Last, an unexpected ﬁnding is that the right insular cortex is a key region when children process the n-back. We discuss the possible roles of brain regions found concordant during the n-back  task and highlight theoretical and practical cance for this methodology and ﬁndings for studies.  signiﬁ- future  Posterior Cortex  The n-back task elicits signiﬁcant ALE scores in parietal regions. Parietal cortices such as the pre- cuneus and superior and inferior parietal lobules have been associated with diverse tasks of visual- spatial (e.g., Bisley & Goldberg, 2010) and problem- solving processes (e.g., Grabner et al., 2007; Newman, Carpenter, Varma, & Just, 2003). Concor- dance in posterior brain areas in children is consis- tent with past adult ﬁndings (Owen et al., 2005; Rottschy et al., 2012) and adult meta-analysis we present in Supporting Information (Table S2). Evi- dence from gray matter development shows that occipital and parietal regions mature earlier in development (Gogtay et al., 2004), which is in agreement with the notion that regions processing visual-spatial information may engage similarly in children and adults.  Frontal Cortex  N-back tasks in children elicit signiﬁcant ALE scores in frontal areas: precentral, superior, and medial frontal gyri (BA 6). However, prefrontal concordance is limited to the inferior frontal gyrus (BA 9). Concordance in superior and medial frontal gyri (BA 6) occupied the largest cluster. Medial parts of the frontal cortex have been associated with cross modal cognitive processes such as behavioral learning, conﬂict detection, and switch- ing from one action rule to another (Nachev, Ken- nard, & Husain, 2008, for review). In the context of working memory, the functional role of the medial frontal cortex was proposed to reﬂect the mainte- nance of attention during the delay between the stimulus and response (Owen et al., 2005). The dor- sal cingulate gyri, in particular, have been associ- ated with higher order cognitive processes, such as coordination of multiple attentional systems (Peter- son et al., 1999), multimodal functions (Shackman et al., 2011), and task complexity (Torta, Costa, Duca, Fox, & Cauda, 2013). From a developmental perspective, concordance in the dorsal cingulate cortex in children may be related to self-control and maintaining tasks rules in the service of problem solving (Arsalidou & Pascual-Leone, 2016). Prefrontal concordance in the inferior gyrus (BA 9) is observed as part of a cluster precentral gyrus (BA 6).

An adult model of hierarchical prefrontal processes suggests that inferior frontal gyri activate to concrete rather than abstract problem solving when holding and manipulating in mind only a few items (Christoff & Gabrieli, 2000; Christoff, Keramatian, Gordon, Smith, & M€adler, 2009). This model explains that more com- plex processes implicate the middle frontal gyri (BA 46 and 9; Christoff & Gabrieli, 2000; Christoff et al., 2009), which are found to be concordant in adult meta-analyses of the n-back (Table S2; Owen et al., 2005; Rottschy et al., 2012). Data also reveal that compared with children, adults show extensive pre- frontal concordance in middle frontal gyri (BA 46, 9 and 10; Table S3).  For children, likely due to the widespread vari- ability of prefrontal activation across samples (Table 1), the meta-analysis does not identify concor- dance in middle frontal and superior frontal gyri (BA 46 and 10). The null ﬁnding we observe here may be indicative of possible prefrontal hemispheric differ- ences across early development (i.e., with a task’s dif- ﬁculty kept constant, depending on the child’s age the right or left hemisphere may be favored for prob- lem solving; Pascual-Leone, 1987). In making predic- tions and inferences in children’s data, one has to consider indices of biological maturation and psy- chological indices of competence level. Biological indices of brain maturation, such as gray matter vol- ume, suggest that the most anterior and dorsolateral parts of the prefrontal cortex (i.e., BA 10, 46, 9) have  \\\\x0c', '8  Yaple and Arsalidou  a protracted development and do not fully mature until an individual’s early 20s (Gogtay et al., 2004). Similarly, developmental theory suggest that compe- tence level is associated with hemispheric dominance in the prefrontal cortex (Arsalidou & Pascual-Leone, 2016; Pascual-Leone, 1987), related to a 2-year inter- vals of step-wise stages of maturation observed by electrophysiological coherence across development (Thatcher, 1997; Thatcher et al., 2008). In other words, the absence of extensive prefrontal concor- dance in children may relate to step-wise alternating maturation patterns that cancel each other out when considering children across age ranges. We propose that the prefrontal cortex in children may be differen- tially implicated, in terms of hemisphere, as a func- tion of age.  Insula and Cerebellum  Signiﬁcant concordance is observed in the insula and cerebellum. The cerebellum is traditionally asso- ciated with timing and temporal sequence of move- ments (Buhusi & Meck, 2005). Individuals with cerebellar damage show impaired performance on cognitive sequencing tasks, independently of lesion type or lesion location (Leggio et al., 2008). More recently, in healthy adults, its involvement has been highlighted in a wide variety of memory and execu- tive functions (Arsalidou, Pascual-Leone, Johnson, Morris, & Taylor, 2013; Habas, 2010; Stoodley & Schmahmann, 2010). Although the cerebellum is active when adults solve the n-back (Owen et al., 2005; Table S2), its role has not been explicitly dis- cussed. Solving the n-back may require control of sequencing of features; thus, based on the literature (Buhusi & Meck, 2005; Leggio et al., 2008), we specu- late that the cerebellum plays a role with visual motor sequencing of information under time con- strains during working memory performance. We highlight sublobar signiﬁcant ALE scores in children’s n-back problem solving in the right insula. The insula connects the temporal and frontal lobes and is located deep within the Sylvian sulcus. The insula became known for its role in affective processes (e.g., Duerden, Arsalidou, Lee, & Taylor, 2013, for meta-analyses); however, it is also involved in various diverse situations that include perception, cognition, emotion, and interoception (Cauda et al., 2012; Uddin, 2015; see Uddin, Kin- nison, Pessoa, & Anderson, 2014, for meta-ana- lyses). Menon and Uddin (2010) offer a general purpose interpretation of the insula describing it as part of a salience network, which detects salient changes in cognitive, homeostatic, and emotion  domains by initiating signals across large-scale net- works to mediate cognitive processes. In this view, as part of a functionally coupled salient network, the insula integrates bottom-up attention switching with top–down control and biasing of sensory input. This dynamic process enables an organism to sift through many different incoming sensory stimuli and adjust gain for task-relevant stimuli, processes central to attention (Yantis, 2008). Fur- thermore, the insula plays a cognitive role by con- necting with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Menon & Uddin, 2010; Namkung, Kim, & Sawa, 2017). The insula is also hypothesized to have a generic role in problem solving (Arsalidou & Tay- lor, 2011) that may reﬂect the feeling of effort that is required during solving demanding cognitive tasks. Goal-directed behavior inevitably borders cognitive and emotional aspects of problem solving in children, such as intrinsically motivated behav- iors (Arsalidou & Pascual-Leone, 2016; Pascual- Leone, Pascual-Leone, & Arsalidou, 2015) critical for carrying out cognitively demanding tasks such as the n-back task. Based on past theorizing and results, we did not hypothesize that the insula would be concordant in n-back problem solving in children. In this respect, meta-analyses are impor- tant for identifying brain regions that may have been underrated in functions of interest. Our meta- analysis highlights the insula for targeted investiga- tion in future developmental neuroimaging studies with children. The n-back task is arguably the most commonly used working memory paradigm in neuroimaging studies. From adult studies, it has been established that a set of brain areas sustains performance on working memory tasks (Table S3; Owen et al., 2005; Rottschy et al., 2012, for meta-analyses), a net- work of areas often referred to as the working memory or executive attention network (e.g., Rueda, Posner, & Rothbart, 2005). Behavioral work has made important gains in understanding work- ing memory across development and highlights its importance to education (e.g., Cowan, 2014). Neu- roimaging research provides critical evidence on brain-behavior relations as they occur across devel- opment. Anatomical indices show that the pre- frontal cortex, an area critical for working memory, develops well after the adolescent years (e.g., Gog- tay et al., 2004); however, functional correlates of development are not as consistent. For instance, some cognition studies show similar regions become activity for children and adults (Thomas et al., 1999), whereas others ﬁnd a more extensive set of areas being activated for children compared  \\\\x0c', 'with adults (Geier, Terwilliger, Teslovich, Velanova, & Luna, 2009). Connectivity studies suggest that key relations in neural networks, such as the work- ing memory or executive attention network and the default mode network, are differentially expressed in children and adults (Chai et al., 2014), linking this heterogeneous relations to the development of both cognitive and affective processes (Arsalidou, Sharaev, Kotova, & Martynova, 2017). We believe that quantitative meta-analyses provide new ave- nues of intergrading large amounts of data and identifying overarching patterns. Critically, the developmental ﬁeld will beneﬁt from lessons learned from compiling and meta-analyzing large amounts of data. In what follows we present limita- tions and lessons learned in preparing this work and theoretical and practical considerations for future studies on this topic.  Limitations  The current meta-analysis examines brain corre- lates to n-back tasks in children up to 15 years. Data we report represent concordance in brain loca- tions across types of n-back tasks. We outline limi- tations associated with the ALE method and the choices we made due to methodology employed in the original articles. For example, a shortcoming of the ALE method is that it considers peak coordi- nates of activation and not activation magnitude. Moreover, due to the nature of the meta-analysis method, the ALE method does not manipulate or measure a cognitive or behavior process, as per an original experiment. It is practically impossible to identify multiple experiments—needed for sufﬁcient power—that used the exact same methodology to examine a speciﬁc function. Our ALE meta-analysis examined activation likelihood patterns in brain locations across studies using different types of n- back tasks in children, and our interpretation of brain areas is limited to this regard. There are two main shortcoming based on methodology employed in the original articles, which we identify and present as considerations for future developmental investigations. First, a methodological drawback of the meta-analysis is the insufﬁcient number of original articles with dis- crete age ranges. Although few studies examined children with discrete ages, others use larger age ranges that average over results from young chil- dren and adolescents (e.g. Nagel, Herting, Maxwell, Bruno, & Fair, 2013). Some even averaged responses of children and adults, which we deemed ineligible for the current meta-analysis. Second, we  N-Back: Meta-analysis of fMRI Studies in Children  9  eliminated several articles, which focus on atypical development. Although, articles focusing on atypi- cal development often employ a control group, within-group results for the control group are often not reported.  Lessons Learned  We present lessons learned from preparing our meta-analysis that may be useful to future research in developmental cognitive neuroscience. First, despite the increased number of fMRI studies with children, many more studies are needed to verify ﬁndings as a function of age. We noticed that even though behavioral and theoretical work suggest that children undergo many stages of cognitive development, fMRI studies tend to average perfor- mance over large age ranges. This limited the types of questions we can address in our meta-analysis. Related, in terms of underreporting, fMRI studies examining children with atypical development often use a control group of children without reporting within-group results for the control group. Thus, from this meta-analysis we learn that improved reporting practices are needed in fMRI studies with children. To make the most of developmental data, we would encourage narrower age-speciﬁc reporting of data, perhaps as supple- mentary data if it is not the main question of study. We recognize that reporting data on narrower age ranges is not often possible; however, reporting age-speciﬁc data would be beneﬁcial for future meta-analyses studies, which may serve as means for overcoming low-sample sizes in original articles. Moreover, we learned that meta-analyses are critical for identifying over-arching patterns in the data and provide opportunities for discovering new tar- gets of investigation. Neuroimaging studies are accumulating and meta-analyses will be critical in the future direction of the ﬁeld. For instance, in the current data, we identify the right insula as critical for solving the n-back in children, a ﬁnding that was not anticipated. In addition, we identify that lack of prefrontal concordance in the data may point to hypotheses of a nonlinear development of this brain region as we detail in the following section where we discuss theoretical and practical considerations.  Theoretical and Practical Considerations  The current ﬁndings have important theoretical and practical implications. Our children meta-analy- sis shows signiﬁcant ALE scores in areas previously  \\\\x0c', '10  Yaple and Arsalidou  associated to cognitive (i.e., parietal cortex, Bisley & Goldberg, 2010; Grabner et al., 2007) and affec- tive (i.e., insula, Duerden et al., 2013; Uddin et al., 2014) processing. Critically, we have not evaluated the emotional state of participants, nor did the orig- inal articles, and thus, we speculate that children’s performance on the n-back may also rely on both cognitive and affective processes in agreement with the interpretation that a more intricate relation exists between cognitive and affective processes in children (Arsalidou, Sharaev, et al., 2017; Chai et al., 2014). Theoretically, this may be consistent with Pascual-Leone’s portrayal of cognitive devel- opment as emerging from a complex relation between cognitions and affects (e.g., Pascual-Leone & Johnson, 2005; Pascual-Leone et al., 2015). Another possible theoretical consideration is that stable coordinates in the prefrontal cortex observed in adults are absent in children. Theories of cognitive development (Demetriou et al., 2014; Pascual-Leone & Johnson, 2005) suggest that cognitive transitions may be characterized by electroencephalographic coherency patterns (Thatcher, 1992, 1997) that alter- nate in terms of hemispheric dominance. Speciﬁcally, a trade-off between the mental demand of the task and the mental attentional capacity of the individual may drive prefrontal hemispheric dominance in problem solving (Pascual-Leone, 1987; Pascual- Leone & Johnson, 2005). This remains an interesting area for further investigation. The current meta-analysis reports quantitative results in stereotaxic space that represent activation likelihood of brain areas for children performing the n-back, a popular measure of working memory. Practically, these coordinates can serve as an atlas for region on interest analyses for future studies and stimulate new hypotheses for future empirical research. For instance, it will be fascinating to examine at which age exactly modulations in insu- lar and prefrontal activity occur and whether they adhere to developmental predictions. We encourage future developmental work, and we advocate for use of narrow ages ranges and reporting of within- group results.  Conclusion  Overall, children performing the n-back task show concordance in posterior regions consistent to those of adults; however, concordance in anterior regions is inconsistent, relating perhaps with pro- tracted maturation of the prefrontal cortex. We underscore the role of the insula, which has not been previously emphasized in processing the  n-back tasks. Methodologically, work on this meta- analysis with children spur the need for improved methodological and reporting practices in future fMRI studies with children. Theoretically, develop- mental models of cognition can be informed of the interaction of affective and cognitive processes in earlier development of school-age children.
